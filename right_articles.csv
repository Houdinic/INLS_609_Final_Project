This is an erratic, paranoid, fundamentalist regime that is eager to find scapegoats. It is not difficult to envision scenarios where things go very wrong very quickly in Iran.An anesthesiologist at one of Tehran’s top private hospitals, who also requested anonymity for fear of retribution, said she believed officials are victims of their own inaction in tackling the disease. “The reason these government officials are contracting the virus is because, they always want to hide the truth; so they don’t use any protective measures when going from this hospital to another just so they project this image that there’s nothing serious going on. It’s only natural that they have been exposed to the virus.” Speaking in a telephone interview, she claimed government officials held back information out of fear of low voter turn out in last week’s parliamentary election.Since it first announced the presence of “We think that this virus has been in Iran for the past three to four weeks and has circulated throughout the country.

No charge.Even if the United States is about as prepared as any country can be for a severe viral outbreak, a lot of other countries are not. And even the most technologically advanced, economically prosperous, and well-run countries are going to find this a serious challenge.<strong>Reasons You Should Be at Least a Little Bit Worried about Coronavirus</strong>If you’re a nonsmoker who is in good health and takes basic preventative steps such as washing your hands, you’re probably going to be fine . . . at least, based upon what we know so far.As noted earlier, the Chinese numbers may be significantly affected by smoking rates in that country. Roughly half of all Chinese men smoke, while very few Chinese women smoke.Some of those numbers sound scary, but keep in mind, this means that if you’re 80 years old and catch it, you’ve still got an 85 percent chance of surviving.The latest China-based study, which was not peer-reviewed by U.S. scientists, found that men had a fatality rate of 2.8% versus 1.7% for women.No deaths were reported among mild and severe cases. The fatality rate was 49% among critical cases, and elevated among those with preexisting conditions: 10.5% for people with cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease, 6% for hypertension, and 5.6% for cancer.The sample’s overall case-fatality rate was 2.3%, Much like other viruses, “We’re already acting as if it’s here,” said Dr. Michael Phillips, chief epidemiologist at the NYU Langone Health System in New York City, which has yet to see a confirmed case. “We’re already thinking about what we should be doing, how we make sure our health care workers are safe. Are we messaging them enough, but not over-messaging them?”That scenario is something that hospitals across the country have been rehearsing for weeks as cases of the new coronavirus, which causes a disease called COVID-19, rise around the world. And while not every U.S. hospital will get notice that a possible coronavirus case is coming through its doors, many say they have been bracing in other ways: They are holding daily briefings with state and local health departments, stocking up on personal protective equipment for health care workers and working with engineers to control air flow in their hospitals to make sure they are best positioned to stop the virus from spreading.“For the whole country, this is not our first rodeo with new germs,”  Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips, executive vice president and chief clinical officer of Providence St. Joseph Health, said. “Ebola was our wake-up call that we needed to be ready for the next pandemic. So we, as well as other hospitals, put in place the ‘just-in-case’ scenario planning.”What’s more, the outbreaks of the past years — swine flu, H1N1 flu, SARS, MERS, and Ebola — All across the United States, since 9/11, hospitals and first responders have been training and running drills to deal with <a href=""https://apnews.com/d36d6c4de29f4d04beda3db00cb46104"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The Associated Press fact-checkers point out</a><strong>Reasons You Should Not Be Too Worried about the Coronavirus in the United States</strong>Today’s Morning Jolt is all about the coronavirus.

No charge.China Daily via ReutersA medical worker in a protective suit inspects a CT scan image in a ward at the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, the center of the novel coronavirus outbreak, February 24, 2020. Advertisement<em><a href=""https://freebeacon.com/columns/the-first-postmodern-pandemic/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">This piece originally appeared on the Washington Free Beacon</a></em>Knowledge of the physical universe has grown exponentially since 1918. So have the means by which we are able to express discontent, fear, blame, and unreason. Which is why I do have one prediction about the weeks ahead: Our politics will remain nasty, polarized, overheated, and dispiriting. Even as Mother Nature reminds us who’s really in charge.This isn’t a serious response. It’s a tantrum. There are plenty of additional things the Trump administration could do to prepare for an outbreak. My American Enterprise Institute colleague, former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., has several recommendations, including allowing for more testing. What the media and Democrats offer instead are dispatches from Resistance Land — that magical place where the border is open, Medicare is for all, the New Deal is Green, and coronavirus isn’t the problem, Donald Trump is.The Democrats criticize Trump for budget cuts that never happened. Chuck Schumer plots a campaign to bash the president for a paltry supplemental request, only to have Trump say Congress can appropriate whatever it wants. Elizabeth Warren introduces a bill to “transfer all funding for @realDonaldTrump’s racist border wall” to coronavirus defense. Has she seen her doctor lately?Financial journalists who see bears around every corner now point to coronavirus as the irrepressible agent of recession. A columnist for the We were better off when the media focused on impeachment. Now that it is interested in coronavirus, a familiar pattern will set in. Data will be publicized without the slightest sense of proportion. The most outrageous scenarios will receive the most attention. Speculation will be paraded as fact. And every conceivable negative outcome, from infections to deaths to plunging stock values, from reasonable and warranted travel bans to unanticipated diplomatic and economic fallout, will be related back to the president in an effort to damage his reelection.The global economy is far more integrated than in the past. And a worldwide broadcast, digital, and social media exist that would have been fanciful to President Wilson. This system distributes misinformation, incentivizes hysteria and partisanship, and expects immaculate performance from the government while ignoring, dismissing, and excusing its own failures. Dealing with “community spread” is hard enough. Try doing it while watching Don Lemon.
This is different from the Spanish Flu. Science, medicine, and public health have improved immeasurably. But that is not the only difference. COVID-19 is novel. No one saw it before last December. No one is sure where it came from. And it has spread quickly. Despite record advances in gene sequencing and drug testing, it will be more than a year before a vaccine can be mass-produced.Perhaps they won’t be. The malpractice of the Chinese Communists may be responsible for the high fatality rate there. The rate outside its borders, according to the World Health Organization, is lower. And America inhabits a different public-health universe than a century ago. Flu vaccines and therapeutics did not exist. Hospitals, the sciences of virology and epidemiology, and medical technology were primitive. Authorities relied on quarantines and appeals for good hygiene. Results were mixed. And disappointing.It has the makings of a phenomenon not seen in a century. The Spanish Flu of 1918 infected an estimated one-third of the global population. It had a case fatality rate greater than 2.5 percent — slightly higher than the rate for coronavirus observed in China so far. More than 600,000 people died in the United States of “La Grippe.” No one wants to see these numbers repeated.Comparisons are tough. After all, the situation is unprecedented. The political consequences of COVID-19 are difficult to predict because of the interplay between a public-health emergency and a fractured public narrative.

This is how populists of left and right are ruling all over the world, and it is exactly what our founders feared most and tried hard to prevent.Populists like Sanders speak as if the whole system is irredeemably corrupt. Sanders was a useless House member and has been a marginal senator because he doesn’t operate within this system or believe in this theory of change.David Brooks is desperately trying to warn <strong>Brooks: Bernie Sanders Is What the Founding Fathers Feared</strong>The road ahead doesn’t look any better. No poll puts her above 15 percent in South Carolina, which was never going to be a particularly good state for her. The poll mentioned above suggests Sander might beat her in her home state, which would more or less spell the end of her campaign. If any Warren fans are hoping some overperformance in other Super Tuesday states might balance it all out . . . she might be a distant second in California, and she might get delegates in Virginia and Colorado. But you can’t second-place and third-place your way to the nomination. If Warren can’t win Massachusetts, where is she going to win?For someone who was supposed to be a really savvy politician, Warren is generating underwhelming results. Warren did okay in Iowa, getting eight delegates and about 20 percent of the final vote — the kind of finish that doesn’t generate a lot of momentum, but keeps a candidate in the game. But she struck out in New Hampshire, which is supposed to be friendly territory for a Massachusetts senator. Her 9.2 percent put her in fourth place, and perhaps even worse, she was ten percentage points behind Amy Klobuchar. She won no delegates in Nevada and finished fourth again with 11.5 percent.Keep in mind, Warren’s rise and fall occurred with the rest of the field Since then, Warren has attacked everyone except Sanders, leading many, including myself, When Sanders supporters proved tougher to win over than Warren expected, she tried playing the “sexist” card on him, and that didn’t work well at all. Her campaign seemed to be based upon the idea that a lot of Bernie Sanders’s supporters could be persuaded to jump on her bandwagon.

(It is more accurate to say those groups are among the most important factions but not Let’s give Warren credit where it is due: Most candidates never come anywhere near frontrunner status, and in October, And soon, Warren may join the list.If you’re a conservative, one of the great delights of the 2020 presidential campaign cycle has been watching one Democrat that the media adores after another fall flat on his face. Everybody looks good in a blue state or district, with a mostly friendly national media parachuting in and swooning over their inspiring rhetoric. Even a modestly successful “beating expectations” presidential campaign is really difficult.

(Some will be allocated by who wins each congressional district, so the under-15 candidates could get one here and there.)The poll shows Sanders is the choice of 25 percent of likely Democratic-primary voters, while Warren is in second place with 17 percent. The former mayors, Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bloomberg, are in a virtual tie for third at 14 percent and 13 percent, respectively.

Less than 0.5 percent came up positive, which is about the same number as the 1,500 known Covid cases in the province.

Many people are asymptomatic when tested, but develop symptoms within a day or two.One common thought on the death rate is that it is lower than advertised because of undetected, asymptomatic cases. But This is thought to have driven the unusually high mortality rate in Hubei, the region of China where the coronavirus first spread. Officials, unprepared for the outbreak, were caught without sufficient hospital beds or health care workers, meaning that many people who might have survived with better care did not. In South Korea, where officials were better prepared, the mortality rate has been a fraction of that in Hubei — so far, about that of the flu.But because the coronavirus spreads widely and quickly, it can overwhelm local health systems in a way that the flu does not.On the other hand:The coronavirus is thought to be much more dangerous for people over age 70 or with existing health conditions such as diabetes.

Apgar was a Florida lady and a woman of the world. She loved God, freedom, and America. Once, she was sitting in a restaurant, next to a festive, somewhat rowdy table. She remarked, “I love the sound of Americans having a good time.” She also loved music, nature, and WFB. Virtually everyone who knew her, loved her. She was kind, smart, lively, moral, and beautiful. She was a generous donor to National Review, and a bright presence on our cruises—for many years, in the company of her elegant sister, Louise Garmy. Mrs. Apgar wanted to perpetuate free enterprise and liberal-democratic values. To that end, she created the Apgar Foundation in 2009. Born in 1928, she has died at her home on the Gulf of Mexico, outside Tampa. She leaves her family and friends, and the many whom she benefited through her philanthropy, full of gratitude.

Under pressure, Bloomberg wilted, blaming the crisis solely on Wall Street’s mortgage-securitization practices.

As a 2015 Federal Reserve Board of Governors paper The tempest over “redlining” began earlier this month, when Bloomberg’s lecture at Georgetown University in September 2008—at the height of the economic crisis—surfaced online. “It probably all started back when there was a lot of pressure on banks to make loans to everyone,” he 6.

More than a year ago, at a 3. At Gatestone Institute, Judith Bergman tracks the increasing crackdown on religion by the Commie bosses in Red China. It should be remembered that Niemeyer had produced an extensive body of work about the totalitarian ideologies of the modern era, especially communism, by the 1970s, by which time it was becoming clear to most observers that the struggle with communism around the globe would be a protracted conflict rather than one likely to lead to apocalyptic violence. The ultimate battleground, Niemeyer concluded, would be in the hearts and minds of those in both the East and West who could bring about renewal through an openness to transcendent truth and the wisdom of the past. In particular, Niemeyer’s deepening faith impelled him to find concrete ways to embody the Christian vision in the public square. And so the essays of his last two decades turn increasingly to matters of culture, literature, the arts, and education in the West.Beginning in the 1970s, a noticeable shift in focus and subject matter in Gerhart Niemeyer’s writings took place. It was in that decade that he began to concentrate less on the intellectual and geopolitical threat of communism and more on the cultural and spiritual condition of the West. Of course, there are no clear demarcations here: Niemeyer continued to write about communism through its demise in the Soviet Union, and matters of culture and spirit had been central to his thought for decades. But the shift was unmistakable.2. At Perhaps the most effective way to persuade alumni and donors to “defund the Ivies” in favor of other projects directed at the non-college population is to highlight how few people actually attend and receive degrees from four-year academic universities. Although about 50 percent of high school graduates eventually enroll in four-year college programs, only about half of those graduate within 6 years. An additional 15 percent or so of high school graduates attend community college, but a majority of those fail to ever obtain even a 2-year degree.Yet even for alumni and donors who are untroubled by these trends, there are still compelling reasons to redirect their generosity. What should benefactors do with the money that they would ordinarily devote to academic higher education generally? A strong case can be made for spending their money on projects and initiatives that improve the lives of ordinary, unspecial people, and especially those without a college degree. This group, which still comprises the majority of the country’s population, tends to be overlooked by philanthropists and foundations even as it fails to qualify for many types of assistance to the poor. Such people are in far more need of help today than the elite individuals who directly benefit from the billions spent on selective colleges and universities.Why should private donors stop giving to higher education? University benefactors should be made more aware of the one-sided ideological profile of faculty and administrators and the relentless growth of the university bureaucracy and infrastructure that is driving up costs. They need to realize that the present volume of private money helps make universities impervious to pressure to reform some of their troubling practices, including their political tilt, their intolerance of dissent, and their burgeoning administrative apparatus.1.

Click away!What’s upstream of politics? Our friends at <strong>Get Some Culture!</strong>Seventy years later, India has once again emerged as a possible bulwark against a rising China. Beijing loomed large as Indian prime minister Narendra Modi received President Trump at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad on February 24. Trump neglected to call out China by name during his stay, but his references to countries that “seek to claim power through coercion, intimidation, and aggression” left no doubt as to China’s influence on the U.S.–India relationship. Though marred by ongoing religious violence in the streets of Delhi, the visit exhibited the mutual affinity between Trump and Modi that may finally turn intermittent alignment into lasting alliance.Just ten days after Chinese Communist Party (CCP) chairman Mao Zedong inaugurated the People’s Republic of China in 1949, Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru landed in Washington for a three-week tour of the United States. BONUS: Donald Trump’s attention to India is a big deal. Daniel Tenreiro explains. No, my argument for abolishing the FISC is twofold. First, intelligence is not fit for judicial management. As the Supreme Court expressly recognized (in its 1948 The contention here is not that the president should get carte blanche. Intrusive government actions taken under the guise of safeguarding the nation against foreign perils have a high chance of suppressing our liberties. The Trump–Russia fiasco launched by the Obama-era intelligence services reaffirms that executive intelligence operations must be subjected to searching scrutiny. Politicized excesses dating back to the John Adams–era Alien and Sedition Acts demonstrate that our own government, under the pretext of protecting us, can do more damage to republican democracy than anything Russia or a similarly treacherous foe can do.That is an observation worth pausing over. While the FISC’s creation was controversial, it is rare nowadays to hear proposals for scrapping it. The inevitable rejoinder to any such suggestion is that the proponent seeks an imperial, uncheckable executive. Nothing could be further from the truth. While the conducting of intelligence operations is left to the executive branch (and has been since the inception of constitutional governance), a The “necessity of procuring good intelligence is apparent and need not be further urged,” remarked General George Washington while commanding the Continental Army. “Upon Secrecy, Success depends in Most Enterprises . . . and for want of it, they are generally defeated.” The acquisition of intelligence is and has always been a security imperative. It is also a textbook political responsibility, in the sense of being committed to the political branches of government.4. Andy McCarthy explains why the time has come to shutter the FISA Court. If bacterial plagues are far more unlikely in our postmodern society, globalization has still made the specter of an epidemic of a viral disease— Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and, most recently, COVID-19—not impossible. The A and B influenzas, despite mass inoculations, infect about 20–30 million Americans per year. Depending on the particular annual mutating strain, anywhere between 10,000 and 80,000 die from seasonal influenzas, mostly the elderly or chronically sick. In addition, given the easy ability to weaponize diseases in labs, and especially given the recent spread abroad of the sophisticated Western sciences of bacteriology and virology to first-generation high-technological and authoritarian societies—China in particular—the idea of a historic pandemic is not always fanciful.Instead, in the modern age, viruses have mostly replaced bacteria in posing theoretical threats of mass infection, illness, and death. While modern Western medicine, given enough time, can sometimes prevent many pandemic viral infections through mass vaccinations, they are, unlike many bacterial illnesses, often impossible, or at least difficult, to treat.Most preindustrial mass plagues were bacterial, caused by urban overcrowding and poor-to-nonexistent garbage and sewage disposal. In the disruptive aftermath of pandemics, fundamental social and political change sometimes followed—wars lost, governments ended, wealth and power reversed. Of course, cheap antibiotics, modern medical care, and sophisticated sewage treatment and refuse collection have mostly ended the epidemic threat of typhus, typhoid, and bubonic plague. Apparently, our trust in modern drugs is such that we arrogantly do not even consider the chance of pandemic danger posed by 500,000 or so homeless Americans, who live outside in harsh weather, amid vermin, excrement, and rodents on our major urban-center sidewalks.3. Victor Davis Hanson knows a thing or two about plagues, ancient and modern, and their consequences. It boggles the mind.“—hold on—to the closest digital copy of one of millions of high-quality songs to which I have full and unlimited access, but neither own nor have to store, and—”“Okay, so I’m using my telephone, which isn’t really a I think about this sometimes when I hear people complain that the bright technological future we were all promised has steadfastly failed to appear. How, I wonder, would I even begin to explain Spotify and Sonos to my grandfather, who died in 1994?

If my grandfather came back today, where would I start?Well, I didn’t put on a I put on a record today.2. Some say technological advances have . . . stopped advancing. The new issue includes a trio of pieces under a special TECHNOLOGY SECTION. Charlie Cooke leads it off, and in his excellent essay, he thinks that dead-end claim is thickly sliced baloney. In TV commercials, Bloomberg was Master of the Universe. Behind the electronic curtain, though, he’s a dull, hapless little man—the Wizard of Blahs. He has some of the Trump attributes that turn people away but none of the ones that make them feel like pumping their fists in the air and putting political hats on their heads. Periodically in American politics a businessman comes along promising to sort out the mess and run things like a blue-chip corporation. It almost never works. Wendell Willkie tried it, and Ross Perot, and Steve Forbes, and remember Herman Cain? Mitt “I like to fire people and also let Detroit go bankrupt” Romney tried it, in his fashion. The businessman shtick worked for Donald Trump because he’s the nation’s blue-collar billionaire, a talk-radio caller (“Don from Queens”), a guy who eats McDonald’s food on his private plane and never sounds like he’s imitating the speech patterns of regular folks. The hotshots with the silver Teslas and the gynecologist wives “Anti-charisma” is a phrase that keeps popping up in Bloomberg stories. Here is a guy who has a knack for not having the knack. As mayor he used to zip off on a private plane to Bermuda for the weekend without informing anyone in city government. Did New Yorkers have a right to know roughly where their mayor was?, reporters asked. Nah, said Bloomberg. Bloomberg has the emotional I.Q. of one of his eponymous data machines. “Don’t ever take a lunch break or go to the bathroom, you keep working,” Bloomberg said in 2011, as if all outputs could be controlled with a keystroke. In 1999, he said that if he let women have flexibility in their schedules to allow for family commitments, he’d have to give men time off to play golf. Even his employees, staffers, and supporters can barely muster a kind word for him. “The thing about Mike is he actually isn’t that interesting,” an ex-employee told New York. “The first time I met him, he started complaining about some soup he got that didn’t taste right. I just met the guy, and he was, like, complaining about his sweet-and-sour soup.” He’s old, Jewish, immensely rich, and running a campaign about nothing—Larry David is not just a perfect Bernie Sanders, he could be Bloomberg too.1. Kyle Smith, in his latest brilliant assessment of a Democrat who thinks he (or she, see Ms. Warren) has What It Takes to be POTUS, profiles the former NYC mayor, America’s Mike Bloomberg — just in time to commit <strong>The New March 23, 2020 Issue of National Review Is So Hot They Had to Close the Printing Plant to Cool Down the Presses</strong>I loved the show, but I’m unsure whether or not my take on Bacon is anything like the curator’s.I’m skeptical of brands, which can become shtick, or a high-dollar routine. Artists sometimes problematize as a marketing tool. Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, and the Wyeths come to mind as the schlockiest of self-promoters. I’m not necessarily hanging their baggage on Bacon, though he was a cunning, coy interview subject. The show left me asking question after question. First, it’s called “Francis Bacon: Late Paintings” while the catalogue is called “Francis Bacon: Books and Painting,” which puzzles me. Why? Literature and art demand very different things from us, and the writers that the catalogue links with Bacon are themselves big, complex beastsBacon was untrained and self-educated and a gutter prodigy, making him a folk artist on steroids. He’s a brand, too, as instantly recognizable as Pollock, Warhol, Picasso, and a few others. And he was a brand who made good copy. He was a celebrity. A brawling Irishman, once a call-boy, always a drunk and a hot gay mess when homosexuality was scandalous, Bacon was a poster boy for complexity and his era’s favorite dark genius. He was also immersed in Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Nietzsche, T. S. Eliot, and Joseph Conrad, to drop a few names.Born in Dublin in 1909, Bacon had a career that spanned 60 years. His crucifixions, deformed self-portraits, triptychs of gnarled figures, and demented popes are instantly recognizable as Bacon’s, but familiarity doesn’t mean I can ever look at them and shrug. His figures are studies in contrasts. He deforms the human figure, twisting torsos and amputating limbs, but his figures spin like dancers or tops. Convulsion is controlled. His palette isn’t neon, garish, or scary, however often he paints blood. He uses lilacs, grays, soft yellows, and browns. He takes us to this weird point where the lyrical and the brutal are in equipoise. It’s a strange beauty.15. Brian Allen visits the Houston Museum of Fine Arts to see the “blockbuster” show by the late Irish artist Francis Bacon. Jack’s enervating recovery in This premise, spotlighting society’s left-behinds — the blue-collar, drug-addicted underclass seeking physical and emotional relief — should offer promise, as Now, in the mediocre new film 14. More Armond: He watches The movie follows Seberg’s career decline, presenting it as the summation of her doom and a consequence of American political subterfuge. (“Speaking out against the perceived flaws of the government is a type of persecution,” she protests.) That means the artistic part of Seberg’s legacy gets short shrift, in favor of making a shady political critique: White, blond Seberg was investigated as part of the FBI’s COINTELPRO project for her support of the Black Panther Party. Seberg helped fund the Panthers and also had an affair with black activist Hakim Jamal (played by Anthony Mackie), by whom she got pregnant.Director Benedict Andrews, screenwriters Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse, and actress Kristen Stewart (who plays Seberg) use the “actor and activist” label to indulge an idea of martyrdom that comes too easily to them. It’s an extravagance of privileged Millennial media to combine self-righteous ideology with romanticism. Godard always saw through it (detailed below).That knee-jerk media appellation “actor and activist” takes on severe meaning in the new film 13. Armond White finds the Jean Seberg biopic was far less about art and much more about politics. <em>Onward</em>I refer to the somewhat obscure, Jacques Barzun definition of decadence: an era when “the forms of art as of life seem exhausted; the stages of development have been run through. Institutions function painfully. Repetition and frustration are the intolerable result. Boredom and fatigue are great historical forces. . . . When people accept futility and the absurd as normal, the culture is decadent.” Oh, and intermingled with the Barzun is a lot of Seth MacFarlane. Recall that A lot of movies can make you cry at the end, but a movie that can make you cry in the first 20 minutes? Ah, the Pixar touch. 12.

After O’Rourke’s comments, President Donald Trump Last year, many Democrats worried that O’Rourke’s aggressive position would alienate moderate voters and give credence to conservative assertions that Democrats really do want to take away people’s guns. Some prominent Democrats felt it necessary to distance themselves from those comments. “I don’t know of any other Democrat who agrees with Beto O’Rourke,” Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) O’Rourke vowed to “buy back every single assault weapon” but said that he would use force if people didn’t voluntarily agree to selling their guns. The former candidate also appears to support all the currently discussed gun-control proposals.Tuesday night, former Vice President Joe Biden announced that Beto O’Rourke “10. Looks like the politically resurrected “Beto” O’Rourke will lead Candidate Biden’s Second Amendment escapades, which has John Lott arguing that November will be the setting for the “gun-control election.” Then the world changed. Jim Crow started cracking open in 1954, and the whole legal edifice shattered between 1963 and 1968. The Vietnam antiwar movement, between 1965 and 1973, killed both the draft and the bipartisan consensus on foreign policy. The feminist movement and the Sexual Revolution toppled the family model of the 1950s. Nixon, once the young avatar of the ascendant Eisenhower-Kennedy era, self-destructed spectacularly in 1973–74. The “youth vote” had been rebel outsiders against the monolith in 1968 (with “Clean for Gene” McCarthy) and 1972. In the 1976 election, the Boomers for the first time elected a president: Until Barack Obama in 2012, Jimmy Carter would be the only candidate in the history of exit polling to win election while losing voters age 30 or over. The Left came back into the political mainstream, and even the Right returned after Goldwater. All of that had happened by the time the oldest Boomers hit their early 30s, and the youngest were in their mid-teens. How It Had Always Been was gone; things had changed.Our natural instinct as young people is to see the world as fixed and unchanging, and to rebel against that. The hard part is accepting that the world doesn’t stay changed. Consider the political world of the Baby Boom generation (born between 1946 and 1964). The Boomers, being such a large and self-conscious age cohort, grew up in the age of the creation of American suburbia and the shift from urban, rural, and small-town extended families to the atomized nuclear family in which Dad came home each night to Mom and the kids. To the oldest Boomers in particular (born in the late ‘40s and early ‘50s), the world of the 1950s and early 1960s was How It Had Always Been. That meant an age of domestic tranquility in white America, which contrasted sharply with the stark injustice of Jim Crow as it edged into the consciousness of the rest of the nation. It meant an age of mostly bipartisan consensus on self-confident hawkish internationalism. It meant an institutionalized military draft, which brought with it a social expectation that every American man would serve — a reality that would have shocked any American between 1776 and 1941. It meant a political scene that combined big-government liberalism with cultural complacency, marginalizing both the Right and the Left. It meant the swaggering certainty that Americans could do anything — a national self-image that had been very much in question in the 1930s, but seemed like it had always been there.9. Dan McLaughlin lowers the boom-er on the politics of “Middle Age” (not the Middle Ages). My portion of the plan — called the New Energy Frontier — focuses specifically on carbon capture, a field in which there is already promising innovation. For instance, the company NET Power, located near my district in Houston, has developed a natural-gas electricity plant that has the capacity to power 5,000 homes, while capturing and recirculating CO2 back through the plant via an innovative thermodynamic cycle. As a result, the system produces zero net emissions.I recently joined House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy in unveiling a proposal that takes existing innovative technologies — ones that have proven to reduce emissions here in the United States — that the U.S. can then market and export to the world. After all, climate change is a 8. Dan Crenshaw (yeah, him) thinks it’s high time conservatives owned the climate-change issue. As a gay man, he could play the identity-politics card with vigor, arguing that support for his campaign would be a step forward for America. In what turned out to be one of his final campaign events, Buttigieg Buttigieg undoubtedly will be back, and perhaps for good reason. It was a stunning feat to go from being the barely known mayor of a mid-sized, Rust Belt city — a place whose prospects he did markedly little to improve during his tenure — to winning Iowa and finishing a close second in New Hampshire. A large part of that success owes to his ability to come across as highly articulate, though close listening revealed that he’s less eloquent than glib. He seemed to model his campaign as the second coming of Barack Obama, but he lacks the charisma of the former president and substituted an impressive ability to memorize so many talking points so thoroughly that he was able to emote as if his comments came from the heart.But it was likely an easier decision for him to make than it would’ve been for Elizabeth Warren, who’s still in the race and several decades older than Buttigieg, who only just turned 38. He’s saying goodbye to 2020, perhaps, but evidently has his eye on 2024 and beyond.Dropping out was the smart thing to do for the sake of preventing Vermont socialist Bernie Sanders from running away with the nomination; his exit means there’s one fewer non-Sanders option dividing the field and splitting the vote.7. Mayor Pete heads for the exit, and Alexandra DeSanctis, who knows a thing or two about South Bend and its former spit-polished kahuna, uses the departure to share some wise analysis. In the days that followed, she released a plan to fund her single-payer health-care proposal. Many critics pointed out that, even with drastic tax hikes, the numbers still didn’t add up. This put her in a bind: She didn’t want to bleed any more of her relatively moderate supporters to Buttigieg, and she realized she couldn’t get to the left of the avowedly socialist Sanders. In mid-November, she retreated on Medicare for All, pledging that she wouldn’t push the matter during her first two years in office, the time when a president typically has the most political capital to spend. By the end of the month, half of her supporters nationwide had abandoned her.“Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this,” Buttigieg said at the debate, after Warren refused to explain how she would fund Medicare for All.At the first debate in June, Warren proudly declared: “I’m with Bernie on Medicare for All.” She rose rapidly thereafter as the candidate of “big, structural change.” By the time the October debate rolled around, she was in first place in national polls. But then Mayor Pete Buttigieg hit her with what proved a devastating punch.6. What goes up must come down: John McCormack reveals that the laws of physics apply to politics and Elizabeth Warren, the ex-candidate. History’s succession of subsequent would-be imperial globalists — the Byzantines, the Caliphates, the Ottomans, Napoleon, Stalin and Hitler — for a while collapsed national borders and spread uniform language, architecture, customs, and culture until their dreams eventually imploded, usually from overreach, military defeat, corruption, bankrupt ideology, demographic calcification, rampant inflation, or sheer inefficiency and bloated bureaucracy.Yet by a.d. 500, the vast sameness was eroding. Most of the Empire in the West and the old borders in East had been picked apart by Vandals, Visigoths, Osogoths, Huns, Sasanians, and a host of other tribes and migrant and aggressive peoples.By a.d. 200, there was a globalized Roman world of 2 million square miles, stretching from Hadrian’s Wall to the Persian Gulf, and from the Rhine to the Atlas Mountains. Like frogs around the pond of One, globalization was not the end of history. It is a recurrent, cyclical, and at best morally neutral phenomenon that has always, at least in relative terms, waxed and waned over the past 2,500 years of civilization — although recent transcontinentalism carries greater consequences in the era of electronic interconnectedness.5. Globalization has its price, warns Victor Davis Hanson. When President Obama nominated Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Court, it was not for her legal acumen. The salient argument made in her favor, as if there were nothing remarkable about advocating such an attribute as a credential, was that she is a model of “empathy” — a “wise Latina” who would bring a “perspective” outside the ken of your average staid old white guy.There is no mob outside a medical lab. When specimens are submitted, the techs do their tests, and the patients either have whatever condition is suspected or they don’t. No one, however, believes any longer that jurists work with such professional detachment and rigor. No one believes they check their political, ideological, and emotional baggage at the door, applying law to facts without fear or favor.The mob is in front of the courthouse because we are inured to the unspoken reality that the Court is innately political. Political entities can be moved by mobs, such as the one that gleefully cheered Senator Schumer on.With 4. Andy McCarthy weighs in on Chuck Schumer’s SCOTUS-directed thug talk. It’s also extremely telling. This, right here, is why so many left-leaning Americans think that “the billionaires” can pay for everything. It’s why Elizabeth Warren was enthusiastically boosted by the media despite her ridiculous pretense that she could pay for a series of gargantuan initiatives without raising taxes on anyone but the extremely rich. It’s why Democrat after Democrat promises not to raise “middle class taxes” while promising programs that require the raising of middle class taxes. How did this bad tweet make it onto TV to be endorsed? Why did Mara Gay agree with it? Why didn’t Brian Williams notice? Because the people involved in this clip thought it was true. This is Obviously, the math here is 3. Ignorance abut basic math . . . the relief that the wealthy can pay for our free lunch . . . it’s all here in Charlie Cooke’s takedown of two babbling MSNBCers who are in desperate need of flash cards and clear thinking. After Biden’s smashing South Carolina victory, the party fell in line quickly, with candidates exiting and endorsing Biden. It was a collective action of the sort that Republicans couldn’t manage in 2016.It also meant that, as a general matter, pillars of the party establishment hadn’t been discredited. The biggest moment in Biden’s comeback was the endorsement of a 14-term congressman and member of the congressional leadership named Jim Clyburn.This made it possible for Biden to run on restoration rather than revolution and find an audience, especially in South Carolina, where many voters told exit pollsters they wanted a return to Obama policies.As Peter Beinart points out in 2. So how’d it happen? Rich Lowry says Joe Biden has the Democratic Establishment to thank. Biden’s wife and daughter did, in fact, die in a car wreck. That is true. It is not true that the driver of the other car was drunk, that he had been drinking, or that there was any reason to believe he was drunk or had been drinking — or even that he was at fault. The late Mrs. Biden “drove into the path of [the] tractor-trailer,” the police report says. But Biden, like every other third-rate ward-heeler of his ilk, thinks and speaks only in terms of good guys and bad guys, white hats and black hats — and if something bad happens to good people, then it must be because somebody in a black hat did something nefarious. The driver of that truck went to his grave haunted by Biden’s lies, to the point where his children were forced to beg the vice president to stop defaming their late father. The casual cruelty with which Biden is willing to subordinate the lives of ordinary people to his political ambitions — for the sake of a petty tear-jerker line in one of his occasionally plagiarized stump speeches — is remarkable.Never happened.He is a vicious self-serving political hack, for one thing, one whose ambition leads him from time to time into shocking indecency. You may have heard that Biden lost his wife and daughter in a horrifying drunk-driving wreck, the fault of a monster of a man who irresponsibly “drank his lunch,” as Biden puts it.What is he?So, he is not a socialist.1. Joe may not be a Marxist. But, says Kevin Williamson, he is a scoundrel. <strong>Enough Links to Last You a Fortnight: 15 Tender and Juicy Morsels that Will Satisfy Your Each and Every Conservative Taste Bud</strong>It’s understandable that we want to find a way out of the Afghan war after 18 years of heartache and toil. But we shouldn’t want the entire effort, and the Afghan government, to collapse. We could have minimized our troop commitment by dropping down to 8,600 troops unilaterally. Making the promise of a total withdrawal only reduces our leverage and that of the Afghan government. In theory, we can always stop a withdrawal based on Taliban non-compliance, even though there are no verification provisions in the public agreement. But the worry has to be that President Trump wants the deal as a justification for a withdrawal he is determined to undertake one way or the other.It’s not encouraging that the Taliban wasn’t willing to negotiate with the Afghan government prior to getting the U.S. commitment to a withdrawal, or to implement a cease-fire during the talks. Bending over backwards, the U.S. cut the Afghan government out of the negotiation, and asked only for a “reduction of violence” over the course of a week as a sign of good faith. Incredibly enough, the agreement calls for the release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners at the outset of the intra-Afghan negotiations and the release of all prisoners of both sides in three months. The Afghan government is balking at this provision for good reason.3. We have a deal with the Taliban. Too bad it’s bad. The White House’s messaging did not fool investors. Stocks plummeted more than ten percent into “correction” territory, and banks slashed their U.S. economic-growth projections to zero for the second quarter. The sell-off receded slightly Monday after the Federal Reserve indicated it would cut interest rates — a welcome move — yet uncertainty persists as the number of cases in the U.S. grows.While federal agencies grappled with byzantine testing regulations, the White House delivered overly optimistic assurances to try to assuage panicked investors. The president himself said we had it “totally under control,” even as the CDC warned Americans to brace for domestic outbreaks.American officials got off to an inauspicious start in addressing the crisis, with diagnostic tests initially limited to some 100 public-health labs. After the Food and Drug Administration expanded testing to other qualified labs, many reported inconclusive results from official diagnostic kits. A University of California–Berkeley lab was barred from testing a patient who did not meet the Centers for Disease Control criteria, which allowed testing only on patients who had traveled to China within two weeks of developing symptoms. That patient later tested positive. The FDA finally expanded diagnostic capabilities on February 29, but not before more than 70 cases had been confirmed in the U.S.2. America needs to be sober-minded about the Coronavirus threat. Yet Biden, notwithstanding his impressive turnaround, is not obviously a stronger general-election candidate than Bernie Sanders. He is old, and he wears his age poorly. No sober observer will ever call either Biden or President Trump a great orator, but the latter is much better at getting his point across. Then there are Biden’s decades as a Washington insider.After the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday, it is looking much less likely that the Democrats will pin their presidential chances on a self-declared socialist. Enough Democrats were alarmed by that possibility to consolidate with stunning rapidity behind the candidacy of former vice president Joe Biden. They have compelling, albeit mostly negative, reasons for doing so: He hasn’t praised Castro’s Cuba, he isn’t calling for outlawing most Americans’ health insurance, he doesn’t want to ban fracking. Democratic voters forced Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, and Michael Bloomberg out of the race. All have now endorsed Biden.1. Biden Won. Bigly. An amazing comeback, true — but it may have been about who Biden <strong>Editorials</strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKv1Ltm-XhI"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">There’s the bell</a>But before descending into the depths of <em>Mamma mia</em>Yep, it was a great night for Biden, (Public Service Announcement: Feel free to insert rope-a-dope joke here.)You gotta admit it, at the Palmetto Square Garden, the Mouth from Scranton got off the canvas a second time — dazed and blathering Dear National ReviewFollow Us",0,Joe Who?

The question is, did he cough into his hand and then press an elevator button, or touch a stairway handrail, or press buttons on an ATM keyboard . . . you get the idea.Close to 20,000 people attend CPAC each year, and a lot of people shake hands upon meeting. Maryland governor Larry Hogan declared in a released statement, “Apparently CPAC chose to notify As of this writing, CPAC is not releasing the name of the conference attendee who tested positive for coronavirus. The person is being treated in New Jersey.<strong>For Once, Everyone’s Hoping It’s Just the ‘CPAC Crud’</strong>You’re going to hear a lot of commentary that will attempt to shoehorn every development in the fight against coronavirus into a “Trump is terrible” or “Trump is awesome” narrative. While there are plenty of bones to pick with the way the administration is handling the coronavirus — see I hated the concept of the 2008 bailouts, because it represented the taxpayers saving financial institutions and General Motors from the consequences of their own bad decisions. But the coronavirus isn’t anyone’s fault (other than maybe the Chinese government for initially underreacting and being so secretive about it). Our government throws money around like it’s nothing; saving cruise lines and airlines and hotels and other tourism-based businesses from going under and causing mass layoffs sounds like a much more justifiable argument. There’s no moral hazard here.(We would be better off if everyone recognized we were in for a big fight. Allow your employees to telecommute if possible. Assure your employees that they can take as many days as necessary if they are asked to self-quarantine. (One university said that after You can see the problem, right? Once the ICU beds fill up, the prospects for the rest of the high-risk population who get infected get a lot worse. Whether or not people die depends upon whether or not they get exposed. Those of us who are not in high-risk categories have a responsibility to ensure we don’t accidentally spread it to those who are in high-risk categories. The “average American” is indeed going to be fine. But just about every “average American” cares about at least one person — a parent, grandparent, friend, neighbor — who is at higher risk.Assume we can prevent half of this population from being exposed and keep the fatality rate to 2 percent. That still adds up to 130,000 fatalities. The United States has 52 million citizens above age 65, and according to the CDC, 21.7 percent of those people are in “fair or poor health.” That gives us about 11 million people who we really need to keep away from coronavirus exposure.The good news is that there are probably plenty of Americans who are asymptomatic, and who are going to not even realize that they have the coronavirus, and simply think they have a cold. The bad news is that these people are still contagious. Even if you’re not in a higher-risk category, you could end up spreading the coronavirus to someone who is.It is a near-ironclad law of human nature that some people will not follow the directions of quarantine. Just this morning, in the St. Louis area, they’re dealing with The CDC now recommends travelers, particularly those with underlying health issues, defer all cruise-ship travel worldwide. “Older adults and travelers with underlying health issues should avoid situations that put them at increased risk for more severe disease. This entails avoiding crowded places, avoiding non-essential travel such as long plane trips, and especially avoiding embarking on cruise ships.”The more resources and steps we throw at this problem early in the process, the better off we will be down the road. If you are among those higher-risk populations (elderly, preexisting health problems, compromised immune systems), you should be limiting your exposure to large crowds. If you’re not sure if you’re in that higher-risk group, the That said, it’s probably time for everyone to start preparing for coronavirus to be extremely disruptive.

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.Don’t panic. But my friend’s advice is comforting. Act too early — at least it won’t be too late.The phone has a way of stimulating the brain and giving you tunnel vision. The physical act of hunching over it, focusing your eyes on a small plane, and tip-tapping your fingers over it is bound to create a physiological response indicating stress. Am I suffering from a self-inflicted delusion or something else? I took my temperature this afternoon: 99.4. And then I read that Italy is thinking of extending its quarantine to the whole nation. Maybe I’ve psyched myself out. There’s a minor and non-fatal peril in staring at your phone and waiting for news updates. Many political obsessives have been doing this since 2015, and they’ve managed to hypnotize themselves into thinking Vladimir Putin controls the world and that, because of this, Donald Trump is turning America into a fascist society. If they’d had social media in 2005, they’d have told you we lived in a theocracy. But the thing driving the crisis isn’t death itself, but the collapse of health-care systems. To take the example above, if the current numbers are reliable, there are another 50–90 bullets among those 700 rounds that could send me or my classmates to the hospital, needful of a respirator or intensive care. And there aren’t that many respirators and ICU beds available. Once a hospital becomes that crowded with critical and serious cases of bilateral interstitial pneumonia, other surgeries get deferred or canceled, or they are performed by exhausted and demoralized doctors. That’s when the death rates start to spike. That’s what happened in Wuhan. And that’s what’s happening in northern Italy now.It’s true that the chances of death for those who are not old or immunosuppressed are small. But not Locally, I’ve already noticed an inchoate class consciousness driving reactions at different levels of society. Bulk-shopping stores like Costco were picked over early. High-end grocers like Whole Foods were ransacked of frozen vegetables this weekend. (An in-law of mine said that shoppers were peering into his cart and at the bags of frozen lima beans as if they might discover a new trove in the store or pilfer his when he wasn’t looking.) But the mid-tier grocers were still well-stocked — except for hand sanitizer. An EMS worker I know is about to work a 24-hour shift. She joked: “Usually, they [the patients] try to rob me of narcotics, now they’re trying to rob my cleaning supplies. What a time to be alive.” Prepared people are preparing. High-information people have started to stockpile. And those who know scarcity are avoiding it by whatever bonkers means necessary. But the great middle is slow to accept the idea that the normal, gentle tide of American life can develop a sudden deadly undercurrent that pulls them down.Nobody responds to the flu this way.Could President Trump be right that the Wuhan virus is less concerning that the flu, because it is less prevalent? Maybe. But I doubt it. When there is not time for long-term longitudinal studies, broad prejudice is a good enough substitute. One might dismiss the extraordinary actions of China, South Korea, and Japan as actions taken by germaphobic, authoritarian East Asian cultures. But why would China’s government, so often known for treating life cheaply, shut down its industrial heartlands for a bad flu season? One could dismiss the quarantine of Lombardy as an overreaction by dramatic Italians, though that doesn’t quite work: Lombardy is more like an Italian-speaking half-Teutonic Switzerland. But Israel has to be level-headed every day to survive, and it is temporarily shutting down entry into the country.In my email to the superintendent, I used a phrase a similarly concerned friend gave me as a shorthand for explaining to myself and to others why I’m taking action: “Too early is, by definition, ‘not too late.’” I’m not a germaphobe or health nut. Far from it. But I have an abiding belief that the hardest prejudice to overcome is the notion that things will go on roughly as they always have.
We aren’t testing asymptomatic people and the disease has an incubation period of at least two days. That seems like a protocol for discovering that you failed to contain the coronavirus, not for discovering when you should start acting to contain it. South Korea and Hong Kong closed schools before they became major vectors of transmission. Their numbers are starting to level off, but Seoul began discouraging people from leaving their homes unnecessarily five weeks ago.I called and wrote an email to the local superintendent of schools and tried to explain my concern that in New York State, schools were only closing when a student or teacher tested positive for COVID-19.But it looks like it reached us. Seattle’s outbreak has spread across several counties. New York’s is still mostly concentrated in mine, Westchester. In five days, Westchester went from one confirmed case to 82. Schools in the lower part of the county, Scarsdale, have closed for ten days. Schools across the border into the Bronx, such as Fordham University, have also closed. A school district next to ours closed for one day because of a trace contact between a student and a confirmed case. Our schools haven’t closed yet, but I think they should.For a significant portion of readers, that’s enough to write me off. “It’s just like the flu, but not as bad,” I’ve been told several times already. That response is based on a sound calculation used by Calvin Coolidge that for every ten problems you can see in the distance, only one will ever reach you.<span style=""font-size: 1.125rem;""><span class=""small_caps""><span class=""drop"">F</span>ine</span>, I’ll say it: I’m afraid of it, the virus.</span>

No charge.Heo Ran/ReutersSouth Korean soldiers in protective gears sanitize shacks at Guryong village in Seoul, South Korea, March 3, 2020.   AdvertisementIn times of duress, the most innate qualities of countries tend to predominate. That’s what we’ve seen with the PRC. We can recognize the intensity of China’s public-health response. But we should acknowledge and condemn the methods by which the world was kept in the dark for too long, and the means by which Beijing continues to interrupt the flow of information. We should not be thanking Beijing for its actions. Instead, we need honesty and the pursuit of the truth to defeat this challenge. And we must acknowledge that the Chinese government’s actions early on almost certainly led to the global crisis we’re facing.Fortunately, despite the well-documented censorship of social media, citizen journalism continues. A popular meme shows Dr. Li Wenliang, the Wuhan ophthalmologist whose social media questioned the “Wuhan pneumonia” in late December and who eventually died from the virus, with barbed wire where his facemask should be. Several citizen journalists have gone missing, including in Shandong province, where there have been reports including in theBut Chinese government face-saving is not stopping at the Chinese border. It is also attempting to control the narrative through state-controlled media, and through their willing partners in the West, including WHO. Government propagandists published a compendium of state-news agency articles, official government statements, and other documents in a book called Alongside that growth and progress, though, China under President Xi is ever more repressive. It uses some of the most sophisticated technology in the world simply to control its population.  That includes Internet censorship, social-media monitoring and tracking of ordinary citizens, and the mass detention of Muslims and other minorities.This reflects what we already know about the Chinese government. It is developing into a modern state, one whose public-health system has significantly advanced from its ordeal with the SARS epidemic just 20 years ago. Per capita wealth is up more than 300 percent, and the Chinese share of the global GDP has more than doubled, from about 7 percent to more than 16 percent over the same period. The most galling result of that image-burnishing is the ubiquity of coverage — and repetition by third parties who don’t care to find out the truth — to the effect that the world should actually  WHO and its director-general, the Ethiopian politician Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, have received criticism for their own response to the crisis. Michael Collins at the Council on Foreign Relations labeled it a joint “dereliction of duty” in a searing blog post in late February. Collins correctly concludes that WHO “laundered” the PRC record, damaging its own credibility by doing so.As careful as the recent Munk School report is, its essential elements were available to WHO researchers before they made their February 16-24 trip and wrote their report praising the PRC response. On February 1, the Yet the Munk School researchers found that censorship of certain keywords in social media had already begun by then. They highlight social-media reports during the prior week by doctors reporting an unknown pathogen, linking it to the Wuhan seafood market. By December 31, social-media channels, including WeChat, were already censoring the terms “Wuhan seafood market” and “unknown Wuhan pneumonia.”On March 3, researchers at the University of Toronto Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy published “Censured Contagion,” a report that meticulously documents a timeline and body of facts that paint quite a different picture than the WHO report, and placing WHO’s accolades for China’s “response structures” that were “rapidly put in place” in doubt. The WHO report concludes that the beginning of the epidemic was December 30, 2019, with the collection of samples from a pneumonia patient in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. Data provided in graphics in the report show essentially zero cases before that date.
But the WHO report and subsequent reporting about what the world can learn from China represents a real-time cleansing of the actual record, a record that includes intentional obfuscation and failure to respond in the early stages of the crisis. This includes the government’s early attempts to stifle communication about the virus, the censorship of doctors and others on social media as cases were being observed in late December, and the continuing suppression of information on social media across the country about how the government, from President Xi Jinping to local administrators, continues to mislead the public and the rest of the world.The world has barely begun to reckon with what the Chinese government claims to have gotten under control. It’s true that forced quarantining and other extreme measures in China played a critical role. The World Health Organization report of its February mission to China praises the PRC for its response: “The response structures in China were rapidly put in place according to existing emergency plans and aligned from the top to the bottom. This was replicated at the four levels of government (national, provincial, prefecture and county/district).” The leader of the World Health Organization mission to China in February, Canadian epidemiologist Dr. Bruce Aylward, encouraged the world to “access the expertise of China,” adding that “if I had COVID-19, I’d want to be treated in China.”It is helpful to review the current status and the timeline that got us here. On Monday, February 24, the World Health Organization determined that reported cases of COVID-19/coronavirus had peaked. At the time, there were about 76,000 reported cases in China, and about 1,800 cases elsewhere in the world. In the United States, there were 14 reported cases. As of March 7, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and state and local public health reporting suggest the number is more than 300 cases, a twenty-fold increase. Globally, there are more than 100,000 cases, with more than 350 deaths in Italy alone.It is too soon to know what may happen. But it’s not too soon for attempts to whitewash the timeline and Chinese-government actions in the earliest moments of the crisis. Indeed, even now, the level of public anxiety about both the virus and what the Chinese government is doing and saying about it remain high.<span class=""drop"">F</span>

We have a This is why we have to “Italy is more or less in lockdown. For what it’s worth, the death rate in Italy is currently at 5 percent — one in 20!When people ask, “Why isn’t there this kind of panic over the seasonal flu?” the answer is, “Because the coronavirus is both more deadly and more contagious than the seasonal flu.” As noted above, the death rate for the seasonal flu is one in a thousand; the current coronavirus figure is roughly 35 in a thousand. Even if that’s elevated because we’re not testing enough, if the figure is cut in half, you’re at 17 in a thousand — or nearly one out of every fifty.Some good news is that South Korean health officials have found that so far, “Secondly, the elderly and immunocompromised who are infected but survive are going to use up a lot of beds and time in intensive care units, and that will have far-reaching effects for those who are well under age 80.

Ann Coulter declares, “Because there are people walking around who have it and who aren’t tested, it is possible that when all is said and done, the U.S. death rate will be significantly lower. But any way you slice it, the death rate for the coronavirus is significantly higher than the death rate for the seasonal flu. And with both coronavirus and seasonal flu, those most at risk are the elderly and the immunocompromised.Many doctors and public-health officials strongly suspect that there are a lot of Americans walking around who have already caught the coronavirus and are asymptomatic — and they either will not show symptoms, or they will suffer such mild symptoms that they won’t even realize they have it. As of this writing, the United States has 729 cases and 26 deaths. That comes out to a 3.5 percent death rate. That’s 35 out of 1,000 people.<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The CDC’s current estimate of the death rate for the flu in the 2018–2019 flu season is 35.5 million cases,</a>Scientists are still calculating the death rate from the coronavirus, and the death rate is probably going to continue to vary from country to country depending upon the country’s quality of medical care and preparedness. But it is already clear that the coronavirus is much more deadly than the usual seasonal flu.Coronavirus cases in the United States and broader world are not going to stay level; they may eventually level off, but we are probably a ways away from anything resembling “herd immunity” — that is, when a significant enough portion of a population is immune to a disease, making it more difficult for a disease to spread. In the absence of dramatic steps to reduce people’s interaction with each other, the number of cases will continue to increase.<a href=""https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/dont-panic-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-guide-to-the-coronavirus/2/#h4"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Scientists are still getting a handle on how contagious the coronavirus is,</a>This research is fascinating and ominous. On January 22, an infected passenger boarded a fully booked long-distance coach and settled down on the second row from the back. He stayed on the bus for four hours and the windows remained closed. Reviewing security camera footage, the researchers found the passenger did not interact with anyone else. The person next to him was not infected, but he did infect two people behind him, one person three rows ahead of him, four people who were six to seven rows ahead of him, and one person who got on the bus after the initial passenger disembarked.The length of time it lasts on the surface depends on factors such as temperature and the type of surface, for example at around 37C (98F), it can survive for two to three days on glass, fabric, metal, plastic or paper.The researchers also found that it can last for days on a surface where respiratory droplets land, raising the risk of transmission if unsuspecting people touch it and then rub their face.The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 can linger in the air for at least 30 minutes and travel up to 4.5 metres – further than the “safe distance” advised by health authorities around the world, according to a study by a team of Chinese government epidemiologists.<a href=""https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3074351/coronavirus-can-travel-twice-far-official-safe-distance-and-stay"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">There is some research from Chinese epidemiologists indicating that the virus may spread much easier than originally thought:</a>According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the coronavirus primarily spreads when someone coughs or sneezes and the droplets get on someone else. The secondary way of spreading is by touching contaminated surfaces or objects.As mentioned a few days ago, the term “going viral” means something that “<em>“There have only been [insert current number here] coronavirus cases, way fewer cases and deaths than the flu!” </em><strong>Why We Fear the Coronavirus More Than the Seasonal Flu</strong>On the menu today: how the coronavirus is both more deadly and more contagious than the seasonal flu, wondering about the track record of “old warhorse” presidential candidates, and Mike Bloomberg breaks some more promises.National ReviewFollow Us",0,"Yes, Coronavirus Is Worse Than the Flu"

No charge.© If there is one lesson of the Trump presidency, it’s that he can’t change to fit the circumstances; he makes the circumstances fit him. That has worked surprisingly well for him. But it may be that the virus is immune to Trump’s powers. It’s almost as if he had a better reason than we thought to be a germaphobe.It’s undoubtedly true that many in the media are eager for this to be Trump’s Hurricane Katrina, but the cast of “It’s nothing more than the common cold,” radio host Rush Limbaugh told listeners. “The coronavirus is being weaponized to bring down Donald Trump.”The conspiracy-oriented pro-Trump blog Gateway Pundit had a piece headlined, “Just Like Her Corrupt Brother Rod Rosenstein — The CDC’s Dr. Nancy Messonnier Drops a Bomb on President Trump While on International Trip.”“The media mob’s weaponization and politicizing of this very serious issue is beyond predictable and disgraceful,” Sean Hannity of Fox News said.But reassurance isn’t the goal. The priority now is to squeeze a global outbreak into the same narrative structure that has sustained Trump.The “letter” Trump was referring to was the transcription of the phone call he had with the president of Ukraine that launched his impeachment. Given how few people actually believe that call was perfect — even many GOP senators condemned it — one has to wonder who was reassured by the claim that our COVID-19 tests are almost as perfect as the phone call that got Trump impeached.On the same CDC visit, the president went out of his way to attack Washington governor Jay Inslee as a “snake.” Trump also said that COVID-19 tests are available to anybody who wants one (that wasn’t true and still isn’t), adding: “The tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect, right? This was not as perfect as that, but pretty good.”A more revealing sign that the president is ill-equipped to deal with this challenge is his irrepressible need to move back to his comfort zone by minimizing the nature of the threat, overpromising the timeline for a vaccine, blaming his enemies, and shifting the conversation back to himself and his grievances.
Trump’s unwavering braggadocio is entertaining (to some) when the stakes are low, but it’s unnerving during a public-health crisis. Trump’s insistence at a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab last week that he has a natural gift for understanding the science of pandemics because his uncle was a nuclear physicist at MIT is not exactly the presidential equivalent of a good bedside manner. It’s about as reassuring as saying, “I’m not an epidemiologist, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.”The president has a number of superpowers — shamelessness, a gift for entertaining his base, the ability to bring out the worst in his enemies and, relatedly, a gift for benefiting from political polarization. The political downsides of these abilities are significant, but they’re manageable when the economy is strong. And they would have been fairly trivial in a contest against a socialist opponent with a long track record of supporting America’s geopolitical foes. But none of these weapons are well-suited to combating a massive disease outbreak that has the ability to stifle economic supply and demand.But the biggest problem the president faces isn’t, strictly speaking, political; it’s biological. If Trump’s foes had set out to create a crisis, they hardly could have designed anything better than COVID-19. Not only is Trump himself famously germaphobic, but the disease and its economic effect are primarily a threat for his best demographic — old people. The news that attendees of the Conservative Political Action Conference were exposed adds insult to injury, as does the likelihood that the rallies that have given Trump sustenance will have to be canceled going forward.A week later, international markets are in turmoil with a recession looking almost assured, the Afghan deal is unraveling, and Joe Biden — the candidate Trump most fears — looks increasingly likely to secure the Democratic nomination.Over the preceding month, Donald Trump’s chances for reelection had been looking pretty good. The economy was roaring, the administration inked a deal with the Taliban for U.S. withdrawal from the “endless war” in Afghanistan (the deal was terrible, but that didn’t seem to matter politically) and, most important, it looked as if Trump was going to get the general election opponent he wanted and worked so hard to get: Bernie Sanders.<span class=""drop"">I</span>

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH:</span><strong>ADDENDUM</strong>As we are seeing, controlling a contagion is difficult enough when those infected are entering legally. When people are crossing borders illegally and interacting with populations without knowing they’re infected, tracking the spread and identifying the contagious carriers is impossible. Quarantines are impossible if infected people do not stay away from those who are not infected; at the heart of a quarantine is an instruction or order from an authority figure that declares, “For the safety of others, you must stay in this area, you may not cross this line.” Every illegal border entry is a response, “I don’t care what you say, I am going to do what I want to do, regardless of the consequences for others.”But with that said, the coronavirus outbreak As far as we know, everyone who brought coronavirus into the United States flew into the country — mostly U.S. citizens returning from overseas trips. If we had the currently proposed border fencing fully completed — or even an American version of the Great Wall of China from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean — it wouldn’t have changed much of anything regarding this coronavirus outbreak.You’ve seen <strong>What the Coronavirus Illuminates about Illegal Immigration</strong>There seems to be this idea that airlines, hotels, resorts, tourist attractions, and cruise lines don’t deserve assistance from taxpayers because they’re proportionally used by rich people. But who do you think works for those companies and industries? By and large, American tourism industry workers aren’t rich! Tourism and hospitality industries combined are the fifth-largest employer in the country, But there’s no moral hazard at work in this situation. The airlines, hotels, resorts, tourist attractions, and cruise lines didn’t behave recklessly or foolishly. They operated their businesses, safely and professionally, and then this horrific virus came out of China. You might argue that these companies should have planned for downturns or slow periods, but . . . how many companies have a contingency plan in place for “what happens if all of Italy shuts down”? The federal government is now urging vulnerable populations not to go onto cruise ships or fly.We can decide what form of assistance to coronavirus-affected industries make the most sense. Similar low-interest loans or stock purchases might work best.(One of the big reasons many people didn’t like the bailouts of 2008 was the sense of “moral hazard.” Banks and Wall Street had made reckless decisions by offering mortgages to people who were extremely unlikely to be able to keep making payments, made complicated financial instruments based upon those mortgages, pumped up a housing bubble, and when it burst, asked the taxpayers to save them from the consequences of their own bad decisions.<strong>How Can We Best Help Businesses Getting Hit by the Coronavirus?</strong>We will get through this with some common sense, some good judgment, sensible precautions, and bearable sacrifices. The best thing about facing a challenge in America is that the vast majority of Americans will rise to any challenge. If you work in the health-care industry, this is your D-Day invasion. As for the rest of us, let’s not forget to take care of our caretakers. Gift baskets, gift cards, Also, warm weather might help a little bit. We shouldn’t overstate it — Covid-19 is a new form of the coronavirus — We don’t know if someone who has had coronavirus and recovered can catch it a second time; the cases in Asia that appear to be reinfection might be someone who never got rid of it and the symptoms flared up a second time. If this is the kind of virus that you can’t catch twice — your body’s white blood cells figure out how to kill off the invading viruses quickly — then we will start to see “herd immunity” — the virus stops spreading because too many people have built up an immunity to it.That’s frightening, and I’m not sure closing schools nationally makes sense in every community. But Bossert’s argument also suggests that by the first week of May, we can begin going “back to normal.” Eight weeks from now, the initial wave of cases will have been treated and we will know whether we “Working parents without child care have a legitimate concern, and we must find ways to help one another. But school closings can be the single most effective intervention. Amid an influenza pandemic, schools would be closed to protect the students themselves. Because children are not among the groups most vulnerable to coronavirus, schools should be closed in an effort to reduce community transmission and to protect the children’s parents and grandparents. How long? Epidemiologists suggest eight weeks might be needed to arrest this outbreak.Yesterday Tom Bossert, who served as homeland security adviser to President Trump from 2017 to 2018, As sad as it is, I’m glad the leaders of the nursing-home industry are recommending You know the basic steps already: aggressive personal hygiene — wash those hands like Lady Macbeth. “Social distancing.” Conferences can be postponed and rescheduled, but people are irreplaceable. Watching an NCAA Tournament or NHL and NBA game without crowds of fans would be really odd, but we could get through it. We’ll figure out how to deal with the economic repercussions as we go. (More on that below.)<a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/basic-math-is-important-guys/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">As Brian Williams and Mara Gay recently illuminated for us,</a>The task before us is daunting but achievable. We’ll get though this, just as we’ve gotten through everything else before. In a few years, we’ll look back and say, “Remember the spring of 2020 with the coronavirus? Man, that was crazy. ‘Getting canceled’ stopped being a woke metaphor.”A little before my time was America’s explosion of domestic radical terrorism. Bryan Burrough’s Most of you are old enough to remember 9/11 and the weeks and months afterwards. The attacks were bad enough, but then we had some lunatic sending anthrax through the mail. An American Airlines flight crashing right after takeoff from JFK, making us all believe the terrorists had struck again. The shoe bomber trying to blow up another one. Sure, coronavirus is scary, but it’s a virus — it spreads more or less though random chance and behavioral patterns. Al-Qaeda was Heck, the Great Recession was only twelve years ago — or ten or eleven, depending on how you define its endpoint. It seemed like every time you turned around, some other company was going under, and there were tons of empty storefronts and foreclosed houses. This is a scary time. But we’ve lived through scary times before.We’re living through history.

And after the extraordinary edict from the Italian government basically closing the country, and after one of the exhibitors tested positive for COVID-19, 
It’s £150,000. Willing was Alexander Hamilton’s peer and partner in establishing the American financial system. He’s probably the most essential Founding Father no one knows, all the sadder since most American students can’t name a single Founding Father. Our schools seem more committed to promoting ignorance when they’re not pushing guilt.Apropos to the coronavirus, Koopman Rare Art offers a 225-ounce silver soup tureen and stand from 1799 made by Paul Storr and retailed by the royal goldsmith firm Rundell Bridge & Rundell. It’s handsome enough, but it’s a presentation piece with a fascinating history reported in its engraved dedication. It was given to Thomas Willing (1731–1821), the first president of the Bank of the United States, by its trustees in 1799 in recognition of Willing’s heroic, sage, and effective moves to bolster Philadelphia’s — and the new nation’s — economy during the city’s four yellow-fever epidemics in the 1790s, which at points reduced the city’s population from 50,000 to 10,000 as people fled to the hills. Willing was also Philadelphia’s mayor and among the most socially and politically wired men in the country. He was Paul Volcker, Jamie Dimon, and David Rockefeller rolled into one.Now, for the smalls. The Paris dealer Christophe de Quenetain is offering a majolica dish from 1525 from the celebrated, exquisite Calini service made by Nicola da Urbino. It’s the Raphael of dishes, a niche object, to be sure, but a beautiful one. There are only eleven pieces from this famous service, made for a Brescia noble family whose arms decorate the center. It’s cinematic, showing Zeus cruising on his eagle, then turning into a white bull that Europa rides, suitably attired in a riding frock, then stripped and escorted to Olympus, whether she likes it or not. The sky and sea are delectable. It’s €1.4 million and for the most serious, focused collector.If you won’t pray to a saint, here’s a king who thought he ruled by God’s command. Stair Sainty has the biggest blockbuster. It’s arguably the last French royal portrait, and from it flows the grandeur that was old-time monarchy. The mammoth coronation portrait of Charles X (1757–1836) is 105 by 72 inches and glistens with power as well as pomposity, which explains why Charles didn’t last long as king. It was painted by Francois Gérard (1770–1837), the preeminent Napoleonic and Restoration portraitist, after Charles’s coronation and given by the king to General Talleyrand, whose family owns it. Charles’s two older brothers, Louis XVI and Louis XVIII, had come and gone, and it was his turn. Charles was an ultra-royalist who believed in the divine right of kings. After a generation of war and discord, the French might have been wistful for the old days as an abstraction, but as a day-to-day reality, not so much. Charles was a flop, though he kept his head on the way out the door in 1830. It’s €2.2 million. It’s fantastic but, like the ter Brugghen, it’s a museum picture. You’d have to have an ego the size of a zeppelin to put the Gerard in your home, and the ter Brugghen is not conducive to domestic bliss.I have to say, since I just wrote about the St. Michael is a buff blond looking to heaven with goo-goo eyes and a stance befitting a matinee idol. Cesari was a high-establishment artist, painting in an older style, celebrating panache even on those messy occasions when saints are slaying devils. Look at this painting and ter Brugghen’s, Saendredam’s, and Ribera’s. You can see the aesthetic revolution that young post-Reformation artists brought. Élan was out, spartan and raw were in. Still, it’s splendid. It sold the first day, and Hazlitt wouldn’t tell journalists the price. I think it was $5 million.New to the market, too, is Cavalier d’Arpino’s Often, artists paint “Ecce Homo” pictures with averted eyes or hammy winces, but this one is direct and inquisitive. Standing in Colnaghi’s booth, I felt like Jesus was asking me, “Have you been good today?” and I squirmed. Had I shoved any nuns to get that last bottle of Purell on the shelf? Well, no, but no one’s perfect and it put me in a repentant frame of mind. It’s €950,000 and a good buy. It’s in superb condition, it’s new to the market, and it’s the best of late Ribera.There were a million religious pictures on view, and as a Methodist on the more austere side of the pendulum, I was ready to call “basta” after a while. Two beauties moved me, though. Colnaghi’s Still, it’s cool and serene. New England’s early Congregational churches have the same aesthetic, since the Puritans were Calvinists. They, too, abhorred tacky scenes of saints dripping blood all over the place. It’s very beautiful as well as very modern. I spent lots of time looking at this gem, which does have lots of color in it, but the colors are subtle grays, blues, and terra-cottas. It’s consigned, and the owner doesn’t want the price disclosed. This usually happens when the owner’s getting a divorce and doesn’t want his wife to know how much money he has. I bet it’s $2 million, plus or minus a few euros.The picture was tucked in a little northern Italian church until 1970. It has never been on the public market and is priced at $5.9 million. I’d call it very Catholic. It reflects Rome’s new adherence to spiritual rigor, the Counter-Reformation, when good religion was about the life and lessons of Jesus. Nicholas Hall is offering a painting that’s very Protestant. Pieter Saenredam (1597–1665) is best known for his interiors of Reformation-era Protestant churches. There, the art doesn’t inspire real, humble piety. Art depicting divinities was idolatrous. Good Protestants were in church to reflect, not to look at pictures. Saenredam’s Two Dutch pictures are poles apart in Reformation iconography. Patrick Williams’s is offering Heinrich ter Brugghen’s Enough with combat. If all else fails in harrowing times, pray.There’s hope for us yet. For €340,000, a bronze Corinthian general’s helmet from around 500 People know things are tough. Even the exceptionally rare silver powder flask offered by A. Aardewerk of Amsterdam was sold on the first day of the fair. Made around 1690 by the renowned silversmith Claus Frankenstein Baardt, it’s masterfully chased on one side with a Vanitas and on the other with a frenzied battle scene. Chasing is probably the most difficult job for a silversmith, since it involves dozens of hours of hammering with the tiniest hammers. There’s only one other powder flask of this exceptional quality, and it’s in a museum. The powder flask is indeed operational. When gunpowder meets a burning fuse, out the muzzle blasts a speeding bullet. It’s tiny — 4 by 5 inches — and weighs less than seven ounces.Whether viral, workplace, political, martial, or marital, any foe will flee in terror having seen the 17th-century Japanese suit of armor offered by Galerie Jean-Christophe Charbonnier, the specialist in samurai gear and other Japanese works of art. It’s lacquered in silver, a luxury reserved for the most lordly samurai. It’s the only example outside Japan of lacquered silver armor, replete with its iron mask and helmet. The asking price was €500,000, but it too was sold the day I left.Themes are limitless, given the range and numbers of objects, but these perilous times do call for prophylactic measures. Speaking of armor, the London arms-and-armor dealer Peter Finer is offering the three-quarter field armor made around 1550 for Heinrich V, the Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel. It’s 54 pounds of steel but probably saw no more stressful use than a gallop in a pageant. It’s sumptuously engraved with scenes from the lives of Hercules and King David. It was on reserve when I got to Finer’s booth, so I couldn’t learn the price, though it’s in the low seven figures.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

In the longer term lawmakers probably won’t be able to resist further stimulus. But what they’ll get for it, no one knows.Uncertainties aside, though, none of this bodes all that well for a temporary payroll-tax cut. Such a measure would slightly boost paychecks instead of giving people a windfall to spend, give more money to the rich than to the poor, neglect the retired and unemployed, and of course fail to target the people most affected by COVID-19. Whatever we do, this shouldn’t be it.But if we accept the idea that stimulus works, we One problem is that even if the Keynesians are right, we don’t have too clear a picture of how much stimulus delivers how much growth — or, for that matter, how much growth we’ll need to make up once the virus takes its toll. The key statistic is the “fiscal multiplier,” with a value of one meaning that each dollar in government spending boosts the economy by a dollar. And there’s little consensus on where exactly the multiplier lies or The theory here traces its roots to the liberal economist John Maynard Keynes. The idea, basically, is that when the economy is moving slowly, the government can speed things up by taking money that isn’t doing much and putting it to productive use, such as by funding infrastructure improvements or simply giving it to people who are very likely to spend it. If there’s ever a time to do this, the COVID-19 crisis might be a good one, since the government can borrow at incredibly low interest rates at the moment.
Most economists believe stimulus can doThe conservative line at the time, especially once Obama was in charge, was that stimulus doesn’t do much of anything except drive up our debt. There’s a solid case for this view in economic theory, which Brian Riedl makes ably and in great detail But what about the broader, longer-term measures under consideration, such as eliminating payroll taxes for the rest of the year? Can the government save an economy that will otherwise fall ill by injecting money into it this way? That’s an old debate, and one that has never really been resolved. We saw it play out most recently in the late 2000s, when two different presidents enacted stimulus measures in response to the Great Recession: George W. Bush sent everyone checks in 2008, and Barack Obama let loose a massive flood of government spending the next year. (Remember Solyndra and “shovel-ready projects”?)Some relief measures are indisputably called for, even beyond medical help. If people are staying away from work on account of the virus, the government needs to keep them afloat financially.

   COVID-19 believes our progress, confidence, and sophistication are not our strengths but rather our greatest weakness, as our vanity and assumed invulnerability render us ripe for panic.Viruses and anti-human microbes have not had a major win in America in decades, perhaps not since polio used to terrorize, cripple, and kill thousands of Americans annually.It is a vengeful enemy. It knows we have killed off or rendered impotent most of its fellow viruses. Its cousin, the flu, has not since 1918 translated its annual tactical wins into a strategic pandemic victory.COVID-19 counts on globalization as it sneaks onto jets and ships. In a few hours, it can find a new home and new hosts to terrify — even thousands of miles away.Or maybe the coronavirus can cleverly keep hopping on jets between countries and states, sowing dissension as nations blame one other for its creation and contagion, and politicians seek to destroy each other rather than band together to kill the virus.Or, if the virus can scare us enough that we cease working and interacting, our canceled-out economy will grind to a halt.If COVID-19 can create fear that we will end up like the grotesque monsters on television, perhaps we, its enemy, will go on hoarding binges that result in shortages of masks, gloves, and supplies for the health providers who need them most.To a popular culture that laps up creepy zombie movies, the virus certainly knows how to use its greatest weapons: fright and panic. As of early this week, the relatively lightweight bug had killed fewer than 30 Americans. But we seem to be acting as if it has already killed 200,000 of us.In desperation, the enemy virus hopes that even if our researchers can quickly infiltrate the COVID-19 master borg and learn its deepest secrets, we will still be unable to treat it with medicines or prevent it with vaccines — or at least not before it becomes a plague of biblical proportions.So the virus hopes that we cannot effectively quarantine the sick, or at least not before a pandemic spreads.COVID-19 also relies on ignorance of its complexity and sophistication. It assumes that our experts will not learn how this new virus originated, how it spreads, and how it sickens or kills.Remember, unlike our past human enemies, COVID-19 is invisible to the naked eye, even more so than the most stealthy terrorists or underground enemy agents. It does not leave a smell. It cannot be heard. It certainly cannot be touched. We know COVID-19 only by the damage it does to us, even after it has left, leaving its trail of fever, fatigue, congestion, and labored breathing.Poor personal and public hygiene gives the virus some sustenance and camouflage. To win — defined as sickening or killing thousands of us — COVID-19 counts on our laxity. It hates careful individuals who block its invasion into the eyes, nose, and mouth.The coronavirus has allies. It infiltrates our defenses by using our own weapons against us — our dirty hands, the habitual touching of the face, and indiscreet sneezing and coughing.
It is more clever by being less lethal — and a little tougher in its ability to live outside a host. Viral resiliency ensures that it rarely turns into a suicide bomber by dying with a terminally sick host, and that it does not perish so quickly when orphaned in the air and on surfaces.Nature has given COVID-19 some weapons that its defeated cousins — the H1N1 swine flu and the MERS and SARS viruses — lacked.To win its war against Americans, COVID-19 must infect and sicken lots of Americans each day. If it cannot infect enough victims to multiply and sustain a hungry army of viruses, COVID-19 will soon sputter and die. It will get trapped in just a few hosts among an otherwise victorious and healthy nation of about 330 million.COVID-19 may not have jets, tanks, or nukes, like our past enemies. But its arsenal, numbers, cunning, and willpower are said to be formidable.But imagine for a moment that we are in real war with a cognizant, thinking, and clever enemy whose sole reason to live is to hurt, maim, or kill as many of us as it can.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

But it is not beyond the realm of possibility to think that, before it runs its course, the coronavirus might end up accomplishing what years of Western actions could not: the collapse of the clerical regime in Tehran. It has, after all, already succeeded in demolishing the last vestiges of the regime’s legitimacy.But coronavirus isn’t just a political challenge for Iran’s ayatollahs. It’s also a major blow to their ideological legitimacy. Religious centers in the country (such as the holy city of Qom) have become epicenters of infection. And the regime’s exceedingly slow response to the spread of the disease in those places has further highlighted the disconnect between the country’s religious establishment and the rest of its population. That’s because, as Iran’s regime, of course, has done its utmost to minimize the true extent of the crisis now ravaging the country.

No charge.Heo Ran/ReutersSouth Korean soldiers in protective gear sanitize shacks, with a luxury high-rise apartment complex visible in the background, in Guryong Village, Seoul, South Korea, March 3, 2020.   Advertisement<em>© 2020 <span class=""skimlinks-unlinked"">Creators.com</span></em> The crisis is here, and we’ve put a serial liar and cheat in the big chair. We must never do anything so reckless again.After days of plunging stock prices, declarations of emergencies by governors, closings by private companies, cancellations of professional sports, and 38 deaths, the president finally decided to stop lying and admit, in a televised address, that we have a problem. But such is his indifference to the seriousness of his job that he made three factual errors in the prepared remarks. As for the bits that weren’t inaccurate, the most he could muster were some vague promises of stimulus and yet another travel ban (for Europe, but not Great Britain). Nothing about improving testing. Nothing about providing paid sick leave for those who need it. Nothing about procuring more ventilators for hospitals, or masks and gloves, which are also in short supply. The crowd that howls about “fake news” is the most pernicious purveyor of it — even on a matter of life and death.Rush Limbaugh told his 20 million listeners on February 24 “the truth” that “the coronavirus is the common cold, folks.” Sean Hannity quoted an “MIT guy” to the effect that “coronavirus fear-mongering by the Deep State will go down in history as one of the biggest frauds.” Fox host Laura Ingraham told her viewers that “Democrats and their media cronies have decided to weaponize fear and also weaponize suffering to improve their chances against Trump in November.”<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Trump spent the next six weeks boasting about this brave defiance of political correctness while also lying to the American people about the scope of the threat. Just at the key moment when people needed to wash their hands, avoid crowds, and learn ways to protect themselves and others to slow the progression of this pathogen, Trump and his mendacious minions were peddling a stream of falsehoods. On February 24, for example, the president tweeted: “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. . . . Stock Market starting to look very good to me.” Two days later, he said  that the number of people infected was “going very substantially down, not up.” “The 15 [cases] within a couple of days, is going to be down to zero.” When the stock market panicked, Larry Kudlow suggested that investors buy the dips.Trump did not create the virus, but his solipsism has deepened the crisis. What is his chief talking point? That he halted flights from China. He did this on January 31, If we are not successful in inhibiting the spread of the virus right now — to “flatten the curve,” as the epidemiologists have taught us to say — the crush in our hospitals could be catastrophic. If hundreds of thousands of sick Americans show up at hospitals all at once, the staffs will be overwhelmed. The U.S. has about 1 million hospital beds, and 68 percent of them are usually occupied. That leaves about 300,000 spare beds. In China, 15 percent of those infected required hospitalization. If the virus spreads very rapidly, and if only 5 percent of American cases require hospitalization, we will run out of hospital beds on Trump has been fortunate until now — as have we all — because no crisis happened. But the coronavirus has obliterated that lucky streak. It’s the most serious challenge we have faced since the 9/11 attacks, and it may yet turn out to be far deadlier. Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician for the U.S. Congress, estimates that between 75 million and 100 million Americans will contract coronavirus. If the mortality estimates of 1 percent hold up, that would mean up to a million Americans could die. It may not be as bad as that, but it could be worse.Eventually, when the Republican Party’s winner-take-all rules made Trump the likely nominee, most Republicans threw in their lots with him too, because partisanship is the opiate of the people. By elevating Trump, they violated their sacred responsibility. Before considerations of policy or identity or history or “fight,” voters must ask themselves whether the person they are granting the powers of the presidency is fit to handle an emergency. If the answer is even a bit uncertain, that person must be ruled out.<span class=""drop"">‘L</span>

But when we get to this stage of a pandemic, it’s really important not to spread the bug. The only thing that helps is social restriction. Ideally, the government should issue that instruction and provide a financial fallback—compensate business owners, ease the financial load on everyone as much as possible and reduce the incentive of risking your life or the lives of others just to make ends meet. But if your government or company is slow on the uptake, don’t be that person. Take responsibility.

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.— The spread of coronavirus is a serious problem, and it requires a serious policy response. We must not further enfeeble American workers by using it as an excuse to enact permanent government mandates and entitlements that risk unleashing unintended negative consequences.Why? For one thing, it does not include a requirement that all employers extend paid leave. For another, it does not provide job protection to workers who don’t already qualify for the similarly titled Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 (and who must work mostly full-time for firms with over 50 employees). That means it wouldn’t cover many workers who currently don’t have paid leave. For a third, it would almost certainly take a weeks-long or months-long application process before benefits could start being paid out. That is Yet many support the FAMILY Act, probably because, like the HFA, it’s been around as a proposal for years. As currently designed, it would provide payments for up to three months at a time to eligible people who, among other things, take leave from work because they have serious health conditions or need to care for immediate-family members who are seriously ill. But it would do little to encourage coronavirus-related leave.This negative effect would exist even if leave benefits were paid for through the government and financed with a payroll tax split between employers and employees, as they would be in the Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act also proposed by DeLauro and Murray (and in 
Obliging companies to permanently provide paid sick leave to workers who don’t currently have it would impose eventual reductions on their take-home pay. The provision of such benefits isn’t costless. We can be sure that in the long run — after the coronavirus fades from the headlines — mandated paid leave would inflict a pricey and permanent toll on workers who would prefer to receive more of their compensation as take-home pay and less as paid leave. Such workers, being disproportionately low-income, would be the least able to bear even marginal reductions in take-home pay.Of course, it’s true that when workers without paid leave don’t work, they aren’t paid, so they may be reluctant to stay home even if they start to exhibit symptoms. It’s also true that if more workers had paid sick leave, fewer sick workers would show up to work and Of more immediate concern, several features of the various current proposals out there make them poorly suited to help control the spread of the coronavirus. For instance, the Healthy Families Act (HFA) proposed by Senator Patty Murray (D., Wash.) and Representative Rosa DeLauro (D., Conn.) would require “all employers to allow workers to accrue seven days of paid sick leave and to provide an additional 14 days available immediately in the event of any public health emergency, including the current coronavirus crisis.” That sounds good in theory, but symptoms manifest themselves between two days and two weeks after contraction of the virus, a period of time during which asymptomatic carriers will not take leave and may unknowingly spread the disease. This is particularly important in the absence of widely available testing for those who fear they may have been infected.Panic is no friend to sound policymaking. If Congress rushes through a universal paid-leave plan, it could fail to target those people who actually lack such a benefit from their employers — a smaller number of workers than many paid-leave advocates acknowledge — and overwhelmingly benefit those companies that already provide paid leave. And if it permanently adopts such a measure, many employers will reduce their privately supplied coverage in response. Such crowding-out is what has already happened in states where paid-family-leave programs were adopted, with many companies that once voluntarily provided paid leave as part of their workers’ employment packages now requiring employees to first tap all the available taxpayer-provided benefits, which in turn has produced larger-than-expected budgetary costs for state governments.It’s one thing to support temporary provision of sick leave paid for by the government when we face a public-health crisis. During emergencies, taxpayers, workers, employers, and Americans in general may be willing to bear a short-term burden that would be unacceptable during normal times. (This explains why even private companies such as Uber are temporarily offering paid leave to their drivers.) But it would be deeply misguided to use COVID-19 as an excuse for a permanent policy change.<span class=""drop"">M</span>

No charge.Fixing those problems isn’t a question of “doing something,” spending more money, or having the right people in charge. It will involve a hard look at what government does — and should and should not do. A resilient society requires a lean and flexible government. Flash policy won’t achieve that.People want effective government during crises like these. That does not mean large government. If anything, government’s sprawling nature has made it less responsive and effective in facing these genuine crises.Moreover, we should take a good hard look at the institutions designed to tackle these challenges. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has spent less than 35 percent of its budget on fighting anything that can described as an infectious disease. Instead, it has focused on lecturing people about lifestyle. There’s a reason few listened when the health authorities warned against buying surgical masks. Narrowing the focus of the CDC back to infectious-disease control could help.Yet while there are things we can do, the most important may be to learn lessons for the next time this happens. Drone delivery is currently neither technologically feasible nor permitted by regulations. In a future pandemic, it could prove vital. So easing up on regulations that could delay experimentation and deployment could prove beneficial. Similar issues present for autonomous vehicles. There are examples like this across the board.Similarly, many states refuse to recognize out-of-state medical proficiency certifications. When doctors and nurses are desperately needed, these employment restrictions will cost lives. Fortunately, some states are leading the way to change this policy, such as Massachusetts and Florida.Then there are policies that discourage resilience. For instance, delivery services are likely to be needed more than ever in the coming weeks. Yet many states are trying to put delivery services like GrubHub out of business by attacking their use of independent contractors.Even accounting rules are a problem. For instance, SEC rules discourage the stockpiling of medical devices such as respirators, which are likely to be needed in large numbers and quickly — exactly what stockpiles are meant for. Mark-to-market rules that helped exacerbate the last financial crisis are still in place, and could pose a major problem as assets turn illiquid with the market downturn.Some policies have reduced effective responses. These include FDA regulations that prevent genetic testing firms from offering medical insights into individual’s genetic traits, which have delayed the development and deployment of tests for COVID-19. That may have contributed to early spread of the pandemic. The FDA has lifted many of the restrictions, but any vaccine or cure still faces tremendous regulatory hurdles before it can be deployed.A temporary lifting of the tariffs will reduce the effects of that second stress and help keep many firms afloat. This would be preferable to announcing exemptions for firms under severe strain, a process that has proven difficult, bureaucratic, and prone to political influence.<span id=""more-789175""></span>Therefore, we should only rush to change policies on the basis of stimulus if they prevent effective response to the crisis, reduce resilience to changed economic behavior, or make the effects of the crisis worse than they would otherwise be.Traditional economic stimulus is inappropriate for a simple reason. It attempts to encourage more economic transactions between people. Increased economic activity is not necessarily desirable in the presence of a contagious pandemic, insofar as it encourages personal interactions.While there are some things policymakers could do, the most important thing is to avoid “flash policy”— hasty reactions that create the illusion of “doing something.” Instead, they should work to reform or repeal policies that may have made the crises worse, and implement ones to make us more resilient in the future.Over the past two weeks, America has faced the onset of a pandemic, an oil-price war, and a stock-market crash. In the face of these three crises, calls for economic stimulus are understandable, even expected. Yet the nature of the crises means that traditional fiscal stimulus measures could be counterproductive.National ReviewFollow Us",0,"Pandemics, Stimulus, and the Limitations of Flash Policy"

No charge.Stimulus is not a cure-all, but a way to reduce the damage from a recession when the Fed has lost its primary tools to fight it.In the short run, the U.S. faces a potential recession as COVID-19 and our much-needed social-distancing efforts produce a massive cash-flow crunch for businesses. The way to alleviate that and to mitigate the waves of layoffs it’s likely to produce is to suspend the payroll tax. The Fed will still likely have to cut rates to zero and restart quantitative easing. And, to be clear, even that might not be enough.Furthermore, instead of fearing fiscal stimulus as an opportunity for government to increase spending, conservatives and libertarians should ask why the government is still levying taxes on capital. Decreasing capital taxation would increase investment opportunities, leading to a rising interest rate and a greater ability of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the economy on it own. To prevent crises over the long term, that’s the direction that we should be headed in.That shortage drove down interest rates around the world, which has in turn made it more difficult for central banks to fight recessions. That in turn creates more fundamental instability, driving down interest rates further. Rather than a blessing, the current ability of fiscal stimulus to produce monetary effects is the side effect of a curse.It may seem that this is all too good to be true. That’s not the right way of looking at it. Instead, it’s that that global instability combined with an aging population has created a persistent shortage of safe saving opportunities.The recession we now face is one in which traditional monetary policy will quickly become ineffective. The current abundant reserve system, however, allows fiscal stimulus to act as a de facto monetary stimulus, because it ensures that excess reserves are always available to fund loans to public or private borrowers. The more the government borrows, the more reserves the Fed creates.This does not mean that fiscal stimulus is completely worthless. Surely some idle resources get transferred to the government, creating a multiplier slightly above zero. . . . On the other hand, the new debt adds permanent annual interest costs to the federal budget. If the goal is to fight a recession, monetary policy is a much more effective tool.In closing, Riedl leaves open the possibility that stimulus could have an effect:Yet this could simply mean that spending, and hence growth, was transferred from donor states to receiver states. In the current system there are no “donor states,” and so increases in growth from spending in one state are not offset by decreases elsewhere.The new system also mitigates Riedl’s worries about empirical studies purporting to show that economic stimulus is effective. He correctly points out that many of the empirical studies on stimulus look at whether states that received more aid grew faster.In fact, that is almost precisely the situation we are in today. During the financial crisis, the Fed flooded the system with reserves through quantitative easing. It now operates what it calls an abundant reserve system. That means that although the Fed has suspended QE and even began selling off some of its Treasury holdings, it intentionally ensures that there are always idle reserves in the system. If for whatever reason banks come even close to not having enough reserves, the Fed loans out more — as it did on Thursday, in the amount of $1.5 trillion.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Riedl notes that, “in fairness to John Maynard Keynes, he was writing in the 1930s when the financial system was in chaos and there were significant idle savings for the government to borrow and spend. That is not the situation in the modern economy.”That misunderstands how excess reserves work. They are used not just to finance the bank purchases but to settle the purchases of anyone who has an account at the bank. That includes a household or investor purchasing Treasury securities.And where there are idle savings — in safes, mattresses, excess bank reserves — it is not clear that most of Washington’s deficits will be funded by these sources. In fact, despite common assumptions that banks fund most stimulus spending out of their excess reserves, less than 5 percent of all Treasury securities are held by banking institutions. Households and investors hold much more of the national debt. The Federal Reserve buying securities would inject new spending into the economy, although that becomes monetary stimulus and can be done without stimulus legislationCan fiscal stimulus even generate monetary effects? Riedl argues that it cannot, at least not to any significant degree. That’s because, he suggests, to do so Congress would finance its stimulus by borrowing otherwise idle money and there isn’t much of that lying around:If an economic-stimulus package were able to generate monetary effects, the Fed, now facing the prospect of a In our current environment, however, the Fed is not exacting complete control. On a basic level, the problem the Fed faces is that its primary tool for stimulating the economy is the lowering of interest rates. Interest rates, however, are already near zero. That gives the Fed little room to respond to a major economic downturn.Indeed, if the Federal Reserve is exacting precise control over monetary policy, it’s impossible for fiscal stimulus to have any effect on the macroeconomy. Whatever short-term increases in growth Congress generated through cutting taxes or increasing spending would be completely offset by the Federal Reserve in the form of interest-rate increases.That’s essentially correct. Fiscal stimulus can work only if it somehow generates monetary effects. Though this insight was lost among Keynesians in the mid 20th century, when consequently the term “Keynesian” earned its current poor reputation among conservatives, it’s at the heart of the story that Keynes himself was trying to tell. His opus is titled “The General Theory of Money, Employment, and Interest.”Every dollar that Congress injects into the economy must first be taxed or borrowed out of the economy. So in a typical, full-employment economy, government spending merely redistributes purchasing power from one part of the economy to another. It is the equivalent of trying to raise a swimming pool’s water level by taking water from one end and dumping it into the other end. (Yes, government could fund new spending through the printing press, but that would be monetary stimulus, rather than fiscal stimulus.)Riedl starts out with a simple but crucial premise:<span class=""drop"">B</span>

But so is spreading panic that induces people to unnecessarily use resources needed for the sick. People are already out there buying metric tons of toilet paper. What’s going to happen at the height of the epidemic? Around 80 percent of those who contract coronavirus don’t even need to be hospitalized, and the vast majority aren’t in mortal danger. Repeating the worst-case scenario of over a million dead as an “expected” result creates the impression that death is imminent.That doesn’t mean that COVID-19 can’t be a catastrophe. Maybe a million Americans will die. What happens, though, if coronavirus pandemic comes in at the lower ends of the death-toll predictions? Many people won’t view it as a success of preparedness but rather a media-generated partisan panic. Americans may be less inclined to listen to the warnings next time.During a congressional hearing this week Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — and probably the most helpfully even-keeled government official during coronavirus outbreak — noted that that media tends to report on the higher end of ranges predicted by models. “Remember the model during the Ebola outbreak said you could have as many as a million,” he noted. “We didn’t have a million.” Two Americans died of Ebola.To put it in some perspective, China has reported around 80,000 cases of coronavirus in a country of 1.3 billion, and the number of new cases has been As for the million expected deaths, theFirst of all, the virus couldn’t be “contained” because we don’t live in a tyranny where we can send in the army and force citizens to shut down society. We live a sprawling and massive country. Yet there are some — Because partisans such as Andy Slavitt, an Obama-era bureaucrat, are out there telling followers and reporters that “experts expect over 1 million deaths in the U.S. since the virus was not contained & we cannot even test for it.”Former CDC director Tom Frieden, Like the reporters and pundits who seek out the most bloodcurdling predictions regarding coronavirus, I have no expertise on infectious diseases. But I’m far more skeptical about what certain experts say — not the scientists and doctors making amazing and tangible strides in combating the disease, but the model-making policymaking experts who often dominate news stories.National ReviewFollow Us",0,COVID-19: Scary Enough without the Scaremongering

Rather than an emergent psycho-social phenomenon, racism today is usually understood by theorists, analysts, and activists in structural and institutional terms that don’t require the prevalence of individual racist attitudes to explain recurrent disparities between racial groups. Bestselling author Ibram X Kendi is one of a number of contemporary writers who Is racism an individual or systemic problem? Traditionally, racism was broadly recognized as an interpersonal phenomenon: reflexive antipathy towards an identifiable “other,” supported by the negative cultural tropes and stereotypes used to inflame resentment and justify discrimination. This was the definition used by history’s most prominent anti-racist figures, from Frederick Douglass through W.E.B. Du Bois to James Baldwin, in their scathing critiques of slavery and Jim Crow. In this telling, racism is a disposition informing the beliefs and behavior of the people who operate society’s structures and institutions. It is a bottom-up process and ultimately exacts untold harms on both oppressor and oppressed.6. At Of that amount, $6,000 was contributed before the year 2000, when Bekenstein donated $2,000 apiece to Massachusetts Republican U.S. Senate candidates Mitt Romney (1994) and Bill Weld (1996), and 2000 presidential candidate George W. Bush.Of the $11.3 million in total donations by all trustees, $9.9 million was donated by Bain Capital executive Joshua Bekenstein. Since 1992, Bekenstein has made at least 437 donations to federal candidates, only $18,500 of which has gone to Republicans.Conversely, current Yale trustees have contributed $10.8 million to Democrats or Democratic-affiliated causes during the same time.Since 1990, the 16 current Yale Board of Trustees members have contributed $11.3 million to federal political candidates, according to Federal Election Commission data collected by 5.

We won in 1989, didn’t we? The commies lost, and their fellow travelers and allies went with them. Ideas, it seems, have strange and varied lives, often counter to fact and reality as well as counter to dream and desire.Indeed, a large percentage of young people, especially, have come to think, wrongly, of socialism as humane, of socialism as distinct from fascism (and National Socialism), and of capitalism as purely exploitative. When reminded that all forms of socialism have historically led to the mass grave, its new exponents claim, somewhat stereotypically, that “real socialism has never been tried.”For those of us who spent our lives witnessing the horrors of each—in the Soviet gulags, the holocaust camps, and the Cambodian killing fields—and celebrating the demise of each in Eastern Europe and Russia between 1989 and 1991, we can only scratch our heads in wonder and search our souls in guilt. After all, we have and had very clearly failed to convince the world that such terms and such ideas should be remembered as a means of what never to do.The evidence is more than clear. Communism, socialism, and progressivism have each made huge comebacks, re-entering political discourse blatantly and, just as importantly, very quietly, over the past decades. Even the very words “socialism,” “communism,” and, especially, “progressivism,” have reacquired respect and a semblance of dignity in many circles of public thought and discourse.3. At That answer became a source of embarrassment, as Boxer could never explain her way out of the problem. At every turn Sen. Sasse has passed up the chance to draw his colleagues into colloquies of this kind. That would not affect the vote, but the confrontation could draw the attention of a wider public.And yet, neither has the sponsor of the bill, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who persistently failed to draw out the meaning of what his colleagues on the other side were revealing. Twenty years ago Sen. Rick Santorum asked Sen. Barbara Boxer to offer the earliest moment when a newborn child could be protected by the law, and she said “when you bring your baby home.”That is the ground now on which the question should be called and fought out in the presidential election. But President Trump hasn’t apparently grasped this gift that has been given to him.The matter was blurted out, almost in passing, by Sen. Patty Murray from Washington. She remarked that “Republicans are peddling a ban that is blatantly unconstitutional.” That is, this move to protect children born alive is incompatible with that “right” proclaimed in The Democrats had arrived at the most radical position yet on the matter of abortion – so radical that the Republican managers of the bill, along with President Trump, still haven’t quite figured out how to express it.And now, with the bill in the Senate, every Republican voted for it, along with three Democrats, while every vote in opposition came from Democrats, holding the line. The bill garnered 56 votes, but short of the 60 needed to overcome the Democratic filibuster.2. At Already there exists ample evidence that the most significant divide today between America’s haves and have-nots is whether they grow up in intact, stable families. Certainly policy wonks will have no shortage of solutions. But if we are to look past the purely economic, what if the real answer is not a package of tax credits but a new Great Awakening?Assume—as I do—that they are right: An America wishing its citizens to prosper, and its workers to know the dignity that comes from providing for themselves, can’t be indifferent to marriage or other traditional institutions that inculcate the virtues a free market depends upon but cannot itself create. Is the issue really that skeptics don’t care about any of these things? Or that they just don’t believe the proposed fixes pushed by Mr. Cass & Co. will work as advertised?But there’s a difference between tweaking programs to address their shortcomings and redesigning an economy from central command. Here’s the irony: Mr. Cass’s movement insists (rightly) that purely economic and material measures are limited. But whenever they move beyond rhetoric to specifics, their preferred solutions almost always turn out to be economic interventions, from child tax credits to industrial policy.1.

Only Autumn’s dreamy-eyed cousin Skylar (Talia Ryder) is sympathetic, displaying girlish truculence learned from working as a grocery-store clerk — crime comes easily to Skylar, who pilfers money from her cashier drawer to finance Autumn’s trip to a New York City abortionist. (What, no Planned Parenthood in Pennsylvania?)That’s what we’re up against. Even a pro-abortion movie like this one, that indicates a minor character’s pro-life enthusiasm, risks a hostile reaction from an agent of our pro-abortion media (which predictably extols the film). Abortion zealots aren’t satisfied that director-writer Eliza Hittman portrays Autumn as a tormented innocent, unable to think through her situation.

She then dropped a bombshell on me: Lou Boudreau, the great shortstop of the Cleveland Indians, taught her to play ping-pong when he was staying at the Hotel Putnam.About ten years ago, on a National Review cruise, I met a lady from Lakeland, Fla. “I know Lakeland!” I said. The lady asked, “How?” “Because I’m from Michigan,” I said, “and that’s where the Detroit Tigers hold spring training.” She then told me that, when she was a little girl, her parents worked in a hotel. One year, Hank Greenberg — the great Tiger star of the 1930s — presented them with a pair of roller skates, to give to their daughter. His reasoning: “Every little girl ought to have a pair of roller skates.”After the war, they became fast friends, visiting each other. Jill made shortbread, which wowed one and all. She shared the recipe.One December, Martha sent me a tin, saying, “Merry Christmas. Enjoy Jill’s shortbread.” Jill? She was a lady from Britain. During the war, Martha’s mother, Sarah, scooped up the leftover soap at the hotel and sent it to our British cousins. She did this through the Red Cross. The Brits were experiencing a severe soap shortage. Sarah’s contact, on the other side, was Jill.Either line would do.She and her siblings, Bob and Louise, grew up in the Hotel Putnam, which their parents owned and operated. It “catered to the carriage trade,” as Martha would say. I teased her that the staff would stoop over to lace her shoes every morning. Alternatively, I teased her that she was a savage out of the orange groves, shoeless.15. This Jay Nordlinger tribute to NR friend and philanthropist Martha Apgar is an unrivaled remembrance. Yet Trump-appointed SEC chairman Jay Clayton — along with the two commissioners who are Democrats These ETFs are popular because they are low-cost, transparent, and well-regulated funds that can be used to reduce risk in a portfolio or to gain exposure to an index with less cash. They are generally straightforward in their names and descriptions, and hardly mislead investors.Deregulation has been one of the great Trump-administration success stories. So why does the Securities and Exchange Commission want more cumbersome rules that will restrict investor choices? A new 456-page SEC rule restricts the availability of a subset of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), specifically those that offer returns that are the inverse or a multiple — double or triple — of a reference index. Inverse funds go up when the market goes down — which has been handy lately. Leveraged funds track their indexes with a multiple of two or three.14.

Biden’s easy wins in Michigan and Missouri, his upset win in Idaho, and a too-close-to-call result at this writing in Washington spell the end of any realistic prospect that Sanders can win the nomination. This is not simply a matter of Biden’s headline strength with African-American voters. It also shows a wider weakness with the white working-class voters who carried Bernie to so many 2016 wins. Sanders has now lost five states to Biden that he won last time: Michigan, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Maine, and Idaho. What happened?White working-class voters were the essential element in transforming the youthful-activist “Bernie Bro” base into a coalition strong enough in 2016 to win not only Michigan but Wisconsin, Indiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Maine, West Virginia, Rhode Island, and a bushel of Western states, and run a very close second in Illinois, Missouri, Massachusetts, Kentucky, Connecticut, Iowa, and South Dakota. Most, but not all, of Bernie’s 2016 wins were by lopsided margins: his only 2016 victories by less than double digits were Michigan (49.8 percent to 48.3 percent), Indiana (52.5 percent to 47.5 percent), and Montana (51 percent to 44.6 percent).Bernie Sanders’s 16-point loss to Joe Biden in the Michigan primary came almost four years to the day after Sanders’s stunning upset of Hillary Clinton in Michigan on March 8, 2016, which became the most important moment of Sanders’s 2016 campaign. Michigan was the first really large state to Feel the Bern. Hillary’s weakness with white working-class voters in Michigan, which took pollsters by complete surprise, would take them by complete surprise again on Election Day in November.12. How did Bernie Sanders lose the white working-class vote? Dan McLaughlin explains. If Biden was eminently beatable, could Booker have beaten him? On paper, the New Jersey senator figured to be well primed to challenge Biden for the “moderate” vote. His heterodox views on school choice and relatively pro-business Senate record could have enamored him to centrist Democrats, who were resigned to a choice between an enfeebled septuagenarian, a small-time mayor, and a lamp-throwing senator with narrow appeal. But Booker, no doubt wary of being attacked as a moderate, Wall Street–friendly candidate in a field whose progressive wing included class warriors such as Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, chose to tack left, taking positions that made him appear unelectable to lunch-bucket Democrats more interested in lowering health-care costs than in upending the patriarchy.But even with his inherent advantages, the former vice president’s vulnerabilities would be insurmountable in a normal primary cycle. His mental lapses — mistakenly Why did Booker fail where Biden succeeded? The Occam’s-razor explanation is probably the right one: Biden was Barack Obama’s vice president, while Booker has been an unremarkable senator with few legislative achievements.In another sense, though, both Booker and Biden are ostensible “moderates” at a moment in which — if recent electoral results are to be believed — a significant faction of Democratic voters are hankering for a centrist figurehead.In one sense, the contrast between Booker and Biden could not be clearer. Booker, for all of his insipid theatrics as a senator — from the “I am Spartacus” gambit to the “11. Cory Booker, writes John Hirschauer, was the coulda nominee. The report also shows that China transplants far more organs than authorities admit. Some 173 Chinese hospitals are currently authorized to do transplants, yet just ten hospitals account for nearly 14,000 annual procedures. The total number of transplants is likely at least several times larger. Beijing is falsifying both the number and the source of the organs it sells for profitBeijing has claimed since 2015 that all organs come from voluntary deceased donors. But the growth of the voluntary figures is highly questionable — rising from 34 in 2010 to 6,316 in 2016 — and The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation highlights this in a 10. Great question Marion Smith: Why do global medical institutions trust the organ-harvesting madmen in China? It is a vengeful enemy. It knows we have killed off or rendered impotent most of its fellow viruses. Its cousin, the flu, has not since 1918 translated its annual tactical wins into a strategic pandemic victory.COVID-19 counts on globalization as it sneaks onto jets and ships. In a few hours, it can find a new home and new hosts to terrify — even thousands of miles away.Or maybe the coronavirus can cleverly keep hopping on jets between countries and states, sowing dissension as nations blame one other for its creation and contagion, and politicians seek to destroy each other rather than band together to kill the virus.Or, if the virus can scare us enough that we cease working and interacting, our canceled-out economy will grind to a halt.If COVID-19 can create fear that we will end up like the grotesque monsters on television, perhaps we, its enemy, will go on hoarding binges that result in shortages of masks, gloves, and supplies for the health providers who need them most.To a popular culture that laps up creepy zombie movies, the virus certainly knows how to use its greatest weapons: fright and panic. As of early this week, the relatively lightweight bug had killed fewer than 30 Americans. But we seem to be acting as if it has already killed 200,000 of us.9. Victor Davis Hanson sees the dangerous bug in terms of an armed enemy. Just yesterday I received an email from a Chinese university informing me that a conference planned for May will still go ahead. The author of the message took the opportunity to make the point that, by the time the conference takes place, China will be much safer than Europe or America. He then concluded with the pronouncement that the coronavirus has shown the Chinese model to be superior to the Western one. Chinese authorities complain that the epidemic has been politicized by those wanting to score points against the regime in China, but they are doing exactly the same. Coming at a time of great-power rivalry, the epidemic has provided the perfect backdrop for a renewed clash of civilizations.At present the most hopeful news about our ability to defeat the epidemic comes from what could roughly be called the Confucian cosmopolis. Singapore flirted with disaster at the beginning but quickly recovered. Vietnam has shown a remarkable ability to contain the spread, and South Korea has proven capable of conducting as many as 10,000 tests per day and has built testing clinics that can detect the coronavirus cases in just ten minutes. Do these facts illustrate the benefits of a moral system that emphasizes duties before rights and places high value on the propriety of customs, measures, and rules as defined by the larger community?The subtle changes of political climate and mores that political thinkers used to write about are suddenly very relevant. I wondered if social mores explained why some countries and not others became hotspots of the infection. As the news from Wuhan started to arrive, I thought of my previous visits to the city: the crowded restaurants serving crayfish, the long meals around the hotpot, the communal living, and the chaos of the wholesale seafood market. But it was not just China. Southern Europeans greet themselves with one or two kisses. Iranians spend time crowded together during daily prayer. Perhaps these were factors, but then the response was no less colored by cultural differences.The outbreak has exposed other divides. As I traveled in increasingly empty planes, one thought kept returning: How notable that we are all together in this, and yet every society seems to deal with the epidemic in its own distinctive way. One of the main divides was between the developed and the developing world. It explained the seriousness in Asia. If poverty and disease are a daily presence or at most two or three generations behind you, you are predisposed to accept that your world can suddenly collapse. The question that Americans and Europeans ask themselves — How was this allowed to happen? — makes less sense than the question of how to survive and how to protect your loved ones.8. The Coronavirus, says globe-trotting Bruno Maçães, exposes a clash of civilizations. In this instance, the answer seems to be that, unlike Trump, Biden will usher in stricter gun control. But that, too, should alarm Democrats. If Biden now has a reputation as a champion of gun confiscation — and if construction workers in Michigan are asking him about it, it suggests he does — he is going to have a hard time winning back the voters that Trump peeled away from the Obama coalition. Barack Obama didn’t say much about guns at all until his second term had begun, and, once he did, he presided over the loss of the Senate, the loss of the White House, and a record-breaking period of civilian firearms sales. Judging by their rhetoric, Democrats seem to believe that the center of gravity has changed on this question since then. But the evidence for this is scant. The State of Virginia is run solely by Democrats — Democrats who were bankrolled by Michael Bloomberg and who promised to pass restrictive gun control as their first priority. They failed, and sparked a massive backlash in the process. Do we think the playing field looks different in Michigan?If I were a Democrat, this would alarm me. Biden’s behavior here is extraordinary, especially given that he is currently previewing the “return to normalcy” theme that he intends to run on in November. One might think that telling a voter that he is “full of s***” and that you will “slap them” matters less than it usually would given that Donald Trump is in the White House. But, arguably, the opposite is true. Elections are about contrasts. If he is as belligerent and ill-disciplined as the incumbent, what is Biden’s case for replacing him?7. Charlie Cooke watches the Biden outburst and cautions, beware. The man in the video — whose name I wish I knew — is right. Biden supports every single serious national effort to restrict gun rights, all of them part of a concerted effort to incrementally terminate civilian gun ownership in the United States. It’s all right there on his (Let’s also take a moment to note that Biden is such a champion of the Second Amendment that not only can’t he get rudimentary gun facts right, almost everything he says on the matter is fatuous. A few week ago he was telling a cheering crowd that Biden, after all, has repeatedly demonstrated that he has zero comprehension of either the purpose or importance of the Second Amendment. Whether your sons are “hunters” or not is completely irrelevant in this conversation. And just as “yelling fire” is protected by the Constitution, so is owning an “AR-14.”6. Joe Biden’s Second Amendment outburst should not dissuade you, says David Harsanyi, from believing that the prospective Dem nominee wants to take away your guns. The bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel — a prime architect of Obamacare — is the most famous person on the committee. Why is that important? Emanuel made headlines a few years ago by But I don’t think receiving such information requires the naming of a big-name board and a major press announcement. Rather, it seems to me that the committee’s true purpose is to be a “shadow” task force that will second guess the Trump administration’s actions to the media and strive to make Biden appear presidential in the face of the threat. If so, this is politics at its most cynical and could inhibit effective public response to the ongoing panic by creating a competing center of information and communication. The unnecessary speech Biden made about not shaking hands or hugging anymore — and the Joe Biden has announced the creation of a 5. Wesley Smith reports on the ghoul — Ezekiel Emanuel — who Joe Biden has tapped to be his Coronavirus guru. I’ve worked extensively with Democrats on China — with Chuck Schumer on cracking down on Chinese fentanyl trafficking, with Chris Van Hollen and numerous others on Huawei’s threat to the world’s telecommunications infrastructure. I don’t exactly hear Biden hammering on these important issues on the campaign trail. And when a few weeks ago President Trump acted to impose travel restrictions on China as a consequence of its abysmal handling of the Wuhan coronavirus, Biden was right there and ready to act as Beijing’s lawyer, slamming the policy as “hysterical xenophobia.” Now, even the Now Biden’s back on the campaign trail, and no one could be more thrilled than the Chinese Communist Party. (A 4. Senator Tom Cotton says that Joe Biden is the man China wants to see in the White House. Conspiracy theorists have added that Joe Biden will soon announce his VP choice, and it will be either a minority or female selection or both, and likely from the field of failed presidential candidates, thereby solving two problems at once: If Biden wins, his young energetic running mate will presumably be fast-tracked into the presidency in a manner that would not have been likely given that this person would never have been nominated much less elected; if Biden selects a “diversity candidate,” it’s apt to allay fears of a rudderless centrist administration. The Democratic vice-presidential selection this year is a way to square the circle of two old white finalists railing about the need for diversity and the tyranny of white privilege; it’s also a de facto nominee for president.The party apparently just needs to get Joe somehow across the election finish line, by curtailing the number and length of his appearances, and adding novelty to the ticket by picking in advance some of his cabinet members who could fan out and act as surrogate campaigners.Many are perplexed over why the Democrats, after trashing Joe Biden for a year and often quite cruelly questioning his mental clarity, have now rallied around him. Aside from the obvious answer that their erstwhile liberator from a Sanders disaster, multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg, proved to be as unpalatable in person as he had seemed persuasive in the monied abstract, they now have no other alternative.Joe is not just folksy affable Joe, but rather a thin-skinned bully, as we know from his lies about the tragic circumstances of his first wife’s death, as well as the idea that his 77 is any way analogous to other septuagenarians in the race. Biden’s problem, then, is not that he is 77 per se, but that he is a different sort of 7o-something than Sanders at 78 or Trump at 73.3. Similar: Victor Davis Hanson sees months of Biden blow-ups. Can Biden be the national unifying force that no prior candidate of his type was? Will that be enough to offset the continuing disaffection of the Sanders wing and the obvious lack of enthusiasm that a Biden campaign generates among younger voters and activists? In the age of Donald Trump, nothing is impossible, but in their search for electability, Democrats appear to be casting their lot with a type of candidate that has no real precedent for actually getting elected.Nixon is the one example of a familiar face campaigning on an end to chaos. He urged a “Silent Majority” to trust him to handle Vietnam, race riots, campus protests, and assassinations. But even Nixon won in a three-way race (with a Democratic governor splitting his party’s vote) against a party trying to hold the White House for a third time after the incumbent, Lyndon Johnson, withdrew in defeat from his own party primaries. Like Clinton, Nixon still got only 43 percent of the popular vote.By contrast, parties looking to unseat an incumbent have settled before on Biden-style “old warhorse” candidates, and lost. John Kerry in 2004, Bob Dole in 1996, and Walter Mondale in 1984 are the classic examples of this type of campaign. Adlai Stevenson in 1956 and Tom Dewey in 1948 were rerun candidates who lost to an incumbent, as was Bryan in 1900. John McCain in 2008 and Hubert Humphrey in 1968 were both old warhorses who failed to hold the White House a third time for their parties. The most encouraging parallels for Biden in modern elections would be the two former vice presidents to win the big job: George H. W. Bush in 1988 and Richard Nixon in 1968. The 1988 election, however, was a choice for continuity.2. The Old Gray Mare she ain’t what she used to be. Indeed, she — and in the case of Joe Biden, a he — never really was. Dan McLaughlin looks at the history of candidates who are coated in Old Warhorse No. 5. They stink. There are honorable exceptions. Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican, is a China hawk attuned to the full spectrum of foreign threats who was warning of the coronavirus when the country — or at least the media — was still obsessed with impeachment. Tucker Carlson, too, has been full-throated about the potential dangers from the beginning.Nonetheless, Trump supporters on talk radio, on cable TV, and on Twitter have gone down rabbit holes of denial rather than reacting to a threat that should be in their wheelhouse with tools congenial to them.Finally, it is the government that will have to organize the U.S. response, not the free market that populist nationalists argue is overemphasized by conservatives and libertarians.It is global supply chains that have increased the vulnerability of the U.S. if the virus runs out of control, with China manufacturing a large share of medicines for the U.S., and other countries beginning to hold on to the masks and protective gear that they make.The It is the so-called Deep State, the vast apparatus that runs the federal bureaucracy, that played a big role in botching the initial testing here.Relatedly, it is globalization and increased interconnectedness that have been a key vector for the spread of the virus.1. More from Rich Lowry: A powerful column on how Trump’s political supporters and nationalists have botched a n obvious moment. <strong>A Myriad of Suggestions, 18 in Fact, Each One Better than the Next, of NRO Reports and Commentaries to Nourish Your Mind and Soul</strong>At the same time, however, it is important that the president’s defenders not be blinded by partisanship of their own into excusing failures of leadership and diminishing the danger of the epidemic itself. This can be particularly difficult because some of the most significant inadequacies of the administration have been the president’s own. So far in this crisis, Donald Trump himself has obviously failed to rise to the challenge of leadership, and it does no one any favors to pretend otherwise.All of this means that the administration faces an enormous challenge, that its successes are likely to be largely invisible, and that its failures cannot help but be magnified. Therefore, we should go out of our way to acknowledge some of the capable people throughout the chain of command doing their best in very difficult circumstances. They have failed in some respects and have succeeded in others. They will do more of both, but there is reason to think they will learn from their errors and step up to the challenge.The virus looks likely to be the most serious acute public-health crisis Americans have had to face at home in decades. It is still spreading at exponential rates. Fatality rates are much higher than the flu and other familiar bugs, particularly for older people. There is no vaccine for the time being. The character of its spread and symptoms threatens to gradually overwhelm the capacity of health systems in affected areas, leaving them short of hospital beds and respirators to treat the most seriously afflicted patients and so dramatically increasing the risks to them. The most effective ways to mitigate this danger involve forms of social distancing that require everyone (not just those at greatest risk) to engage in measures like canceling events, limiting travel, and avoiding public places — measures that cannot help but seem extreme in our free society. That these expedients are necessary and appropriate is increasingly clear and yet difficult to explain to the public.2. We take issue with the President’s handling of the Coronavirus outbreak, and encourage some actions. Of course, the explanation must be sexism. It can’t be Russian trolls on Facebook — this is the Democratic primary we are talking about here! Senator Warren says it is sexism, her amen corner in the media says it is sexism, all right-thinking people say it is sexism — and what this says about Democratic-primary voters is of some interest.We sympathize, truly. It is difficult to believe, and must be tough to accept, that any barely competent political operation could be defeated by the steadiness and freshness of Joe Biden or by the suavity and wide-ranging appeal of Bernie Sanders. And Senator Warren likes to think of herself as more than barely competent but omnicompetent, competence personified — “competence incarnate,” as Megan Garber calls her in Elizabeth Warren cannot believe that she was defeated by the campaigns of Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders — she insists, instead, that she was defeated by their testes.1. Too late to get into the last <strong>Editorials</strong>Yep, keeping with the theme of these days. Okey dokey, dive into the OK, now before we get on with the China deserves to be connected to the virus it did more than its share to loose on the world, no matter what its foreign ministry or the sensitivity police say.There was actually no good reason for naming the flu after the Spanish. The case of China is different. Its government tried to suppress warnings about the new coronavirus and looked the other way, giving it the room to become a national and then a global crisis.Such international contention over the name of a virus or disease isn’t new. Syphilis was the Neapolitan disease, the French disease, or the Polish disease, depending on who was naming it. The 1918 influenza came to be known as “the Spanish flu,” ­although Spaniards called it “the French flu.”Chinese officials still want to squelch the use of “Wuhan virus,” whereas Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is perfectly content to refer to the virus that way.There is no doubt that a raging virus that got its start in China and has shut all of Italy and caused disruption and fear around the world may create negative ­associations around China. This would happen regardless of the name, though.That blathered, there is plenty below about the biological badarse that has laid low unlucky victims and economies and traditions. What to do? Well, one thing — which would require an edit of some preceding verbiage — is to consider dubbing it the “Wuhan Virus,” if only to remind the world permanently 1. of its geographical origins, and 2. that it was China’s commie-fink leaders who abetted its spread. If only the sentiments of this institution’s leader, Rich Lowry, prevail. What a distinction for poor P.J. Collins. What would he have thought of a great grandson who boasted of this 103 years later in some conservative missive? Well Great Gramps, little or big, drenched or dry, you were a parade Grand Marshall, and they can’t take that away from you. So let’s have a drink to that!There was almost a precedent: The historic parade was nearly deep-sixed in 1917, when a monsoonish nor’easter swamped the city. Still, its hardy organizers ruled that a parade was to be had: Grand Marshall Patrick J. Collins, an expert horseman, led 50 mounted aides through a tempest, from 42nd Street to 50th Street and Madison Avenue, at the rear of St. Patrick’s Cathedral, where, from behind the windows in his dry and warm residence, Cardinal John Farley and various churchmen blessed the soaked riders who comprised the measliest, smallest, shortest Paddy’s Day Parade ever.No calamity of the elements ever kyboshed New York City’s St. Patrick’s Day parade, which for the first time in 258 years has been cancelled: Next week’s promenade, like so many other gatherings, conferences, galas, semesters, and basketball and hockey games (even seasons), is a victim of Coronoavirus.Dear National ReviewFollow Us",0,Whack for My Daddio There’s Hand Sanitizer in the Jar

No charge.The way to stop such a subsidy race is for President Trump to make it very clear that, as far as the U.S. is concerned, it will insist on removing subsidies, not adding to them.While it’s formulating its approach to the airline industry, the Trump administration should realize that once the COVID-19 virus has passed from the headlines, foreign governments will be under intense pressure to ramp up subsidies to their favored airline carriers in order to regain market share.A similar approach is now called for to rebalance business in the struggling airline industry. This is not about threatening to add new tariffs as part of a trade negotiation, a process that the Trump administration has sometimes handled well and sometimes poorly. Instead, we should convince trading partners to level the playing field and make sure that we enforce existing agreements.The Trump administration recognized the need to take into account changing patterns of trade and subsidies last year when it replaced the existing North American Free Trade Agreement. The recent United States–Mexico–Canada agreement (USMCA) contains new language that safeguards U.S. farmers, auto workers, and suppliers from unfair foreign subsidies. USMCA also includes strict enforcement mechanisms that will make it easier to ensure that future violations are dealt with in a timely fashion.U.S. senators across the political spectrum, from Democratic senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey to Republican senator Ted Cruz of Texas, have said that the subsidies for Middle Eastern carriers are costing U.S. jobs. They point to studies showing that more than 1,500 jobs are lost for every daily international aviation route lost to unfair subsidies.U.S. carriers have long believed that foreign competitors — especially from Middle Eastern carriers — have violated the letter and spirit of the Open Skies agreement, which regulates which airlines get to fly to another country’s airports. The goal of Open Skies is to benefit consumers by providing open entry, with barriers raised only if a government-subsidized carrier is using an artificial advantage to compete unfairly with privately owned carriers.
But now is also a good time to consider other long-term steps to strengthen the U.S. domestic airline industry, including those that have nothing to do with loans or bailouts.Larry Kudlow, head of the White House’s National Economic Council, recently said on CNBC that deferral or temporary repeal of some taxes — such as on fuel — paid by the airlines is on the table.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Congress last week that the administration is considering loan guarantees and tax deferrals for the industry. “We are not looking for bailouts,” he said. “There may be specific industries that are highly impacted by travel that have issues with lending. . . . I would assume the airlines would be on the top of the list.”Analysts agree that the government is likely to step in and help U.S. airlines as they slash schedules and lay off employees.

Within a few minutes of the debate’s conclusion, the CNN anchors had switched focus to the latest news about the coronavirus. The 2020 presidential campaign is more or less on hold, as well.The boss: Biden “won the beginning of the debate over the coronavirus and scored points on Bernie’s foolish call for a political revolution and on his reprehensible praise for Communist dictators. Biden is the presumptive nominee largely because he is the acceptable alternative to Bernie, and most Democrats will probably look at tonight and think he will be able to present himself as an acceptable alternative to Trump, too, in the fall.”Dan McLaughlin: “It’s a good point. For all of his “Malarkey!”-shouting combativeness, Biden is at heart a dealmaker who wants to build a messy consensus. This means he’s rarely willing to completely smack down a fellow Democrat’s idea.Jay Nordlinger: “Last night was different, and arguably much better, in the sense that without the audience, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders didn’t bother trying with the applause lines. The problem was it felt like two old men discussing vacation plans while the house is burning down around them. Neither one has a dramatically different vision for how to deal with this crisis beyond “do more and get the military involved” and “tell Trump to shut up.” A significant portion of the debate focused on Bernie Sanders’s contention that Biden once supported cuts to Social Security. (Many year ago, Biden expressed a vague openness to the idea as part of entitlement reform.) The notion that a President Biden would cut Social Security — with a Democratic House! — seemed about as realistic a threat as an invasion by the Klingon Empire. And once again, it’s not like we are lacking much more pressing threats to America’s seniors in the here and now.The two remaining Democratic presidential candidates held a debate last night. I watch all the presidential primary debates, out of professional obligation, and often feel like I’ve lost several hours of my life that could have been better spent. Many nights over the past year, a crowd full of no-hopers and also-rans exchanged prewritten one-liners and bumper-sticker slogans in 75-second increments for a theater audience that had been conditioned to applaud any sequence of words delivered with sufficient emphasis. <strong>Oh, Hey, There Was a Debate Last Night</strong>But we’ve got a long and difficult road ahead. Come on, vaccine researchers. Come on, herd immunity.This kind of frightening, widespread disruption of our lives is probably going to make “ordinary time” — yes, I think this is the key to Lynch’s love of the 1950s. World War II had just ended, people had just been through hell, so there was a real appreciation for the safe and wholesome, with a pop culture modern audiences would consider to be boring; the darker and more horrific a situation you put someone into, the more beautiful “boring” becomes in contrast.Why does Lynch mix the macabre and the mundane in his art? It’s not to highlight the macabre — it’s to highlight both in order to give us an appreciation for the beauty of the mundane. It’s to find the balance point in any situation, and for Lynch, this makes the macabre beautiful, too. What is the white picket fence on its own? We need to see the creepy crawlies under the surface, and this will give us the contrast we need to appreciate the white picket fence . . .Over on NR’s home page, We’re living through an extraordinary time — a nightmare for some, merely surreal for others. Our kids will be telling their kids about the coronavirus outbreak of spring 2020. (Putting large swaths of American life on hold is going to be an economic beat-down the likes of which we’ve never seen.

But we’ve already seen effective responses to this virus in very different societies, using the tools available to governments that have wildly different structures, strengths, and weaknesses. America is likely to produce such a response, too. And if we do even half as well as the Chinese or the South Koreans, the rosier predictions of the downplayers could turn out in retrospect to be closer to the truth than those of the doomsayers.Humanity retains its resiliency and its survival instinct. One of the reasons we should reject the worst-case predictions of doom, revolution, upheaval, and a society forever changed is that so many of our friends, families, celebrities, and politicians are still engaging in the normal partisan and cultural warfare. Mutual recrimination and umbrage is like a security blanket we are reaching for in a time of distress. And it’s a sign of our continuing investment in the idea that the near-term future won’t look that different from the past.  
   The pattern of response in Wuhan began with a mixture of social and governmental denial and bumbling. That was followed by a brief and frightening period in which hospitals were overwhelmed and mortality rates spiked, just as we’re now seeing in Italy. But as the crisis has dawned on societies elsewhere — as alarm at the Chinese and Italian experiences of the disease has spread abroad — we’ve seen those societies’ populations buy into the social distancing, cleaning, and compliance that allows health institutions to get ahead of the disease. South Korea, for example, moved to this buy-in period quickly, and seems to be getting on the other side of the disease faster as a result. The American private sector is already responding with a shocking speed in some cases to close large institutions and events.  
   Unless Western governments plan to do nothing to stop spread of this disease in the hopes of culling their native elderly populations — a conspiracy theory I’m entertaining during these late, anxious nights more than I ought to be — then such projections of scores of millions infected are just as irresponsible as Trump’s predictions that the disease will miraculously disappear. They’re based on a model of exponential spread of the disease, one that has met no policy resistance from governments or social resistance from populations. But that’s not an accurate picture of human or governmental behavior. Governments respond to such crises, and so do societies. American “social distancing” and changes to hygienic norms started picking up speed once Italy’s extraordinary measures were reported, and have shown no signs of slowing down.But whereas China held the line well below 100,000 infections, European leaders are telling the public that millions will be infected. German chancellor Angela Merkel, informed by her public-health authorities, chillingly announced that up to 58 million Germans, fully 70 percent of the country’s population, could contract the coronavirus. If fatality rates followed anything like those in Italy, that could mean well over a million deaths. Medical officials in the United States have offered similarly dire warnings.
As much as I remain in the alarmed camp, Hannity isn’t entirely wrong that there is some “over-the-top rhetoric” out there. Five thousand people have died from coronavirus, out of a total confirmed population of roughly 137,000 sufferers. China seems to have gotten beyond the crisis point weeks ago. South Korea has accomplished the same, with only 66 deaths over a population of nearly 8,000 confirmed cases. The situation is much more serious in Europe, where Italy still has not gotten its outbreak under control and has seen nearly one in every 15 confirmed cases die over a very quick period.On Following Trump’s lead, the talk-radio right and a few personalities on Fox News have fed their audience disinformation as the pandemic unfolds. Rush Limbaugh explained to his millions of listeners last week that “all of this panic is just not warranted” because “this virus is the common cold.” “Why do you think this is ‘COVID-19’?” He asked. “This is the 19th coronavirus. They’re not uncommon.” Here, too, he was wrong. The 19 refers to the year in which this new virus originated.Trump isn’t alone, of course. In fact, he is repeating claims from mainstream outlets that were au courant about a month ago. Back then, media outlets were claiming that popular fear of coronavirus was worse than the disease itself, and possibly driving anti-Asian animus. They repeated over and over that the seasonal flu kills more people each year, without mentioning that coronavirus may be 20 times as lethal and twice as transmissible, requiring heroic exertions to contain. Nor did they mention that the virus results in a greater rate of hospitalization.Right now, as schools and sporting events and bars and restaurants close, as distressing reports from Italy come over the wire and toilet paper goes out of stock, the downplayers look like fools and potential menaces to public health. Donald Trump is the downplayer-in-chief, and he is already suffering for his demonstrably false statements about the virus. Trump said that U.S. cases were under control, and that they could go down from 15 to zero. “It will go away” he promised. “One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear,” he said, contemplating the ructions in a market that has since had worse days. “Anybody that wants a test for coronavirus can get one,” he guaranteed at a time when doctors across the country were openly expressing their frustration at not being able to test even symptomatic patients. People coming off planes from affected countries were being tested, he assured the public when in fact they weren’t. In the weeks and months to come, his downplayer mindset could well haunt his reelection bid and become his legacy.<span class=""drop"">P</span>

Questions abound as to the duration and depth of the coming recession, which may limit the private market’s ability to facilitate orderly bankruptcies in the near future. In that worst-case scenario, we should consider government assistance, if properly implemented, an attempt to bolster the market rather than to distort it.But while Rattner’s assessment is encouraging, it may be overly optimistic. If the coronavirus shock spreads to the financial system, and banks face their own difficulties, a credit crunch could close the spigots of capital. Indeed, the White House has already suspended interest payments on federally held student loans until further notice. Mortgage payments may come next, if Italy’s experience with the virus is any guide. To be clear, no businesses seem to face uncontrolled bankruptcies yet. Airlines still have large existing credit facilities and may be able to secure loans in the private market if the impact of the virus proves ephemeral. Steven Rattner, the Obama administration’s “auto czar,”  The government stepped in not to In 2008, the prospect of Chapter 7 bankruptcies led policymakers to bailout American automakers. As three economic officials explain in a While it is often used in individual bankruptcy, corporations rarely go bankrupt under Chapter 7, because immediate liquidation imposes greater costs on both a firm’s stakeholders and the economy. Thus, when they do take place, Chapter 7 liquidations arguably constitute a “<span>NOW WATCH: </span>The alternative is Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which requires a wholesale liquidation of the struggling firm. In this case, a bankruptcy trustee sells off the business’s assets to the highest bidder and uses the proceeds to cover the firm’s liabilities. The company immediately folds and lays off all of its workers.However, during a credit crunch, firms face difficulty obtaining such financing, as lenders contend with massive systemic risks not present during typical bankruptcies. Holdings across balance sheets become distressed, so banks are not in an especially good position to extend a lifeline to any one debtor. Much like bank runs, the absence of DIP financing is a collective-action problem. A sufficient capital injection is likely to reduce the harm to all of a firm’s stakeholders — shareholders, creditors, Typically, struggling businesses enter bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S Bankruptcy Code, which allows them to restructure their debt and continue operating as a “going concern” while the terms of their reorganization are negotiated in court. This kind of bankruptcy takes at least several months, and in order to continue operating through the process, a firm needs access to credit. Usually, those funds come in the form of “debtor-in-possession” (DIP) financing, by which a creditor extends loans in order to keep the bankrupt firm alive. These loans are typically in the best interest of creditors, since keeping a bankrupt firm’s assets in operation increases the expected payout to lenders following bankruptcy.Milton Friedman used to stress that capitalism is a system of profit The public tends to balk at bailouts, which “socialize” losses for companies that enjoy profits during good times.

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Also worth reading: It But regardless, the upshot here is that we could be actively working to suppress COVID-19 at great financial and social cost — or paying the price in dead bodies for our failure to do so — until a vaccine becomes available. Oh, and that will be about 12 to 18 months.Importantly, though, these are not the only suppression measures that countries might try. As the report notes, “as case numbers fall, it becomes more feasible to adopt intensive testing, contact tracing and quarantine measures akin to the strategies being employed in South Korea today.” It might also be possible to tighten and relax restrictions repeatedly, or tighten them in some places but not others, as needed, which would lessen the total amount of time people spend under harsh social-distancing rules. And again, this is just a simulation that involves tons of guesswork.<img alt="""" class=""wp-image-789991 size-full aligncenter"" data-image-id=""789991"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" height=""269"" loading=""lazy"" sizes=""(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID2.png?resize=606%2C269&amp;ssl=1"" srcset=""https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID2.png?w=606&amp;ssl=1 606w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID2.png?resize=300%2C133&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID2.png?resize=459%2C204&amp;ssl=1 459w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID2.png?resize=50%2C22&amp;ssl=1 50w"" width=""606""/>That’s not good, so what about the more forceful approaches taken in China and South Korea, which require population-wide social distancing? The good news is that this works, as we’ve seen in those places. The bad news is that it works only so long as it’s in effect, at least according to these simulations. Here’s one for the U.S. where the efforts are lifted after five months:<img alt="""" class=""wp-image-789990 size-full aligncenter"" data-image-id=""789990"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" height=""330"" loading=""lazy"" sizes=""(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px"" src=""https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID1.png?resize=553%2C330&amp;ssl=1"" srcset=""https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID1.png?w=553&amp;ssl=1 553w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID1.png?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID1.png?resize=459%2C274&amp;ssl=1 459w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID1.png?resize=50%2C30&amp;ssl=1 50w"" width=""553""/>Here’s a chart showing the simulated effect of some mitigation strategies, such as isolating people who are diagnosed and closing schools. (This simulation is for Great Britain, but the situation isn’t much better in the U.S.) These measures are far better than nothing; they manage to spread out the load on hospitals’ critical-care capacity, and they could reduce deaths by half. But hospital capacity is still overwhelmed many times over.Basically, we can have two different goals here. The less disruptive one, “mitigation,” aims to slow the spread of the virus so that it doesn’t overwhelm our ability to treat severe cases. (This is often called “flattening the curve.”) The more aggressive approach, “suppression,” aims to squelch the outbreak entirely.The COVID-19 Response Team at Imperial College London has National ReviewFollow Us",0,This Could Get Very Bad and Last a Very Long Time

The ordinary, traditional questions of democratic politics — Mitt Romney was (and daily is) savaged for voting to impeach Trump. A few nutjobs with radio programs suggested that he should be One of the tragedies of our current mob-populist model of politics is that elevating presidents and presidential candidates to the status of tribal totem makes it virtually impossible to take intelligent countermeasures against them. Republicans have been abject in the face of Trump, of course, but the same dynamic holds sway on the other side of the aisle: Democrats went to the mattresses to defend Bill Clinton from the consequences of actions that would have cost him his job if he had been a junior executive at an office-supply company in Scranton, and not only defended but encouraged and celebrated Barack Obama’s extraconstitutional adventures and the criminal misconduct of his administration in the matter of the IRS targeting the administration’s political rivals. (After lamenting that the PATRIOT Act might enable Dick Cheney to go snooping around your library records, Barack Obama discovered, to his surprise, that he had the power to unilaterally order the assassination of American citizens and then proceeded to do so, which was met, inexplicably, with a bipartisan yawn.) Trump was not wrong about shooting people on Fifth Avenue.You’re probably overestimating your influence, too. But that is not what this is really about: This is about pledging allegiance.And if you happen to be a journalist or commentator who is holding your fire on one politician or another because you are afraid that you might tilt some voter the wrong way by saying what you actually think — by telling the truth as best you can — then you are in the wrong line of work.I have been banging away since 2016 on this point: “I preferred Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton” is a perfectly defensible position — but it is not the end of the conversation. It matters whether Trump is capable, competent, and honest. It matters whether he is trustworthy and whether he is understood to be trustworthy. Likewise, if you are on the other side this time around, or if you are a lifelong Democrat, then “I prefer Joe Biden to Donald Trump” is also a perfectly defensible position — but it is not the end of the conversation. It matters whether Biden is capable, competent, and honest. However the argument works out for you, it is important to go into this with eyes that are clear and wide open.All right, I might strike that last sentence.Set aside, for a moment, the more substantive question of how the government’s early nonchalance will shape events in the next few months and consider the pure That’s not exactly working out: On Monday, trading was halted one minute after the market opened and the Dow plunged 2,250.One of the maddening things about the U.S. government’s tardy, inadequate, and incompetent response to COVID-19 is that it was the result, in part, of an unnecessarily stupid political calculation. Donald Trump spent 2016 sneering at the idea that the performance of the stock market during the Barack Obama years indicated anything about the quality of the Obama administration’s economic policies; he spent much of his presidency up until a couple of weeks ago boasting about the performance of the stock market during his own administration, arguing that it illustrates the excellence of his administration’s economic policies. He spent the early days of the COVID-19 crisis treating it as though it were principally an economic challenge and spent his time trying to “tweet the markets back to life,” as my We adults should try to use the time fruitfully.<em><strong>Long Days</strong></em>Welcome to National ReviewFollow Us",0,Character in the Time of Coronavirus

We’re used to hearing disingenuous cries that “In the vast majority of these cases, the connection between your actions and the purported threat are tenuous at best.

Sure, the coronavirus might pose only a mild threat to you, but do you owe it to senior citizens or the immunocompromised to alter your behavior because of the risk to them?A left-of-center friend of mine observed with frustration that many people are not practicing anything resembling individual responsibility during this crisis. They weren’t prepared for an emergency or potential disaster of any kind, they rushed out and stockpiled toilet paper, they hit the bars last weekend and filled them up, and they clearly believe that whatever happens to them, the government will rescue them if things get bad.

The U.S. currently has over 5,000 confirmed cases and at least 93 people have died.“Chairman Xi can expel all the real journalists he wants, but he can’t change the fact that his coronavirus cover-up killed thousands of his own people and put the world at risk,” Sasse said.Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, blasted China’s decision, saying it shows that Chinese president Xi Jinping is “terrified of a free and independent press because he doesn’t want to be challenged when his government regularly spews insane propaganda.”“It is a grave mistake for China to move backwards and cut itself off from several of the world’s top news organizations,” Baquet said.Executive Editor Dean Baquet urged the U.S. and China to “move quickly to resolve this dispute,” as the “health and safety of people around the world depend on impartial reporting about its two largest economies, both of them now battling a common epidemic.”TheShani George, director of communications at the “The Chinese government’s decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to covid-19 [coronavirus] is essential,” Executive Editor Martin Baron said in a statement. “Severely limiting the flow of that information, which China now seeks to do, only aggravates the situation.”The “Trusted news reporting from and about China has never been more important,” Murray said. “We oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world.

Just look at their success in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, or the United States. The ChiComs are the problem. If the Chinese government spent as much time working on educating its people and regulating dangerous markets as it does on secrecy and propaganda efforts, maybe it wouldn’t have to worry as much about diseases being named after it — or about the catastrophic death and economic pain their negligence helps cause.I hate to thrust my Western cultural values on anyone, but maybe it’s time to stop eating bats.This kind of thing happens quite often. And not always in China, of course. But the avian influenza was likely If reports are correct, it was in Wuhan’s popular “wet markets” that vendors were selling the bats — and possibly snakes — that may have caused the COVID-19 outbreak. “Wet” because the meat sold in its unsanitary stalls was only recently slaughtered.The Chinese regime is perfectly capable of administering an array of authoritarian policies to suppress the rights of its own people. But it’s apparently unable to exert even mild cultural pressure warning them that their eating habits can be extraordinarily dangerous, and hold the potential of creating massive socioeconomic problems.Though millions of Chinese have been lifted out of extreme poverty through free trade, with modernity comes some basic responsibilities — like, for instance, not killing everyone in the world with preventable zoonotic diseases.The Chinese Communists, like all Communists, hide their societal problems. There is no crime, disease, or addiction in the collectivist state. This kind of secrecy and dishonesty can be disastrous, especially in a highly interconnected world.Early on, the Communists destroyed samples and suppressed vital information that could have helped mitigate the damage of this new strain of coronavirus. The government also silenced doctors who warned about the disease. Some were censured for “spreading rumors” or sharing test results with colleagues, and some were forced to write a self-critical public letters — a Marxist mainstay — admitting that the warning “had a negative impact.” The Chinese Communists probably let five million people leave Wuhan without screening, But while the Spanish have a good case to be annoyed, the Chinese government does not. As Jim Geraghty 
The latter was, until very recently, widely referred to as the “Spanish flu,” a virus that killed around 675,000 Americans and tens of millions of others around the world in the early 1900s. “Spanish flu” has now retroactively fallen into disfavor as well. And to be fair, there is some historical evidence that the virus may actually have originated in Anyway, “COVID-19” or “H1N1” don’t exactly roll off the tongue.But naming viral diseases after places — Guinea Worm, West Nile Virus, Ebola, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, etc. — is probably just intuitive. Viruses “come” from someplace, after all, and thus people gravitate to those names. I doubt we came up with “Lyme disease” because of some deep enmity towards Connecticut.There are many traditional naming conventions that don’t really make that much sense. Somewhat weirdly, for example, we often name diseases after the people who “discover” them — Hodgkin’s disease after Thomas Hodgkin, Parkinson’s disease after James Parkinson, and so on.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.So far, one government health minister, Nadine Dorries, has tested positive for the virus. Another, Edward Argar, was filmed coughing over the dispatch box while addressing Parliament. That is not a good look, to say the least. If the government is correct in its strategy, it likely won’t be vindicated until after this is all over. In the meantime, it ought to be very conscious of optics, and more clearly communicate its response to the virus.We maintain our confidence in the CMO [chief medical officer], the experts, and the decisions we are making. What we are disappointed with is the way Conservative ministers have communicated that information. We feel they haven’t really made a clear enough case as to why our position is so radically different to other countries. We aren’t saying it’s the wrong advice, it’s just that we feel there is increasing concern that people don’t know what’s going on.A Liberal Democrat spokesman put it well when he said that the issue is, at least partially, one of clear communication:It’s impossible to tell which side is telling the truth. But the U.K.’s approach thus far remains glaringly out of step with those seen around the rest of the world. Singapore and Taiwan, two of the countries that have most successfully contained the virus, adopted stringent “social distancing” measures early on in their outbreaks. South Korea realized that it had gone from a handful to hundreds of new cases in a few days due to two main clusters from a church in Daegu city and a nearby hospital. This was caused by Some have argued that it was this warning that spurred the Johnson government to take a more aggressive approach, shifting from mitigation to suppression. But the government maintains that it has been following the experts’ advice all along, and the shift announced yesterday was always part of its “action plan.”Crucially, they warned that if the former option was chosen, “the resulting mitigated epidemic would still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed many times over. For countries able to achieve it, this leaves suppression as the preferred policy option.”Coincidentally or not, yesterday was also when a report by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team was A shift didn’t appear to come until yesterday, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson all of a sudden announced that “now is the time to stop all non-essential contact with others,” advising Britons to avoid pubs, clubs, theaters, and travel when at all possible. He also emphasized that anyone living in a household with a person who has a persistent cough or fever must self-isolate for 14 days.
On Saturday, Britons over 70 were told to stay in strict isolation in their homes until July, in a “wartime-style” mobilization effort that will also see the requisitioning of hotels and other buildings as temporary hospitals and the emergency manufacturing of respirators for the critically ill.Jenny Harries, England’s deputy chief medical officer, emphasized the continued importance of proper handwashing and other hygienic measures. The country’s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said measures to tackle the spread of the disease would need to be in place for a “prolonged period,” and thus the government was introducing them more gradually so they could be sustained. Whitty also confirmed that the National Health Service would no longer test those with mild symptoms, reserving tests for those who present at hospitals with respiratory problems. This was in contradiction with the World Health Organization’s advice to keep testing.On Friday, Britain’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said that 40 million people would need to catch the coronavirus to build up “herd immunity.” He said that the government’s approach could help “reduce the peak of the epidemic, pull it down, and broaden it” while protecting the elderly and vulnerable. “If you suppress something very, very hard, when you release those measures it bounces back, and it bounces back at the wrong time,” he told the BBC. This suggested that the government considered mass infection to be inevitable.France, Belgium, and Ireland had all canceled sporting events. English soccer authorities would eventually follow suit, suspending the Premier League by themselves. But the U.K. government had not banned — and, as of now, still only discourages — mass gatherings. Many are left wondering: What does the British government know that the rest of the world doesn’t? How can its approach be so different from that of other countries’ governments?<span class=""drop"">I</span>

When we allow market pricing to work its wonders, it forces people to be civic-minded, forces us to be that guy in What happens if the merchant doesn’t “price gouge” is that his critical items may simply disappear instantly and the person who   What Sanitizer Man was trying to do was ordinary retail arbitrage, which is a widely practiced multibillion-dollar business even in non-panicky times. (Don’t believe me because I’m a heartless capitalist? Then take it from those fluffy empaths at NPR. There is an excellent Some guy who bought $70,000 worth of hand sanitizer and wipes with an eye toward “price gouging,” i.e. reselling these items for whatever the market determines their worth to be at this moment, should be drawn and quartered after he is tarred and feathered but before he is hanged from the nearest lamppost, say social-media users. Wrong. These items were selling for less than their market value at Dollar Tree and Walgreens, where the guy snapped them up. When retailers don’t charge market rates, middlemen naturally step in to ensure proper pricing. Would we rather he store the stuff in his basement and not share it with the community, which is what ordinary Costco hoarders are selfishly and mindlessly doing as a group? Why shrug at hoarding but be cross with the anti-hoarder, the reseller? Value is, as always, highly contingent on time and place, as you would know if you’ve ever bought a happy-hour drink, a Tuesday night ticket to the movies, or an off-peak train ticket.Springsteen used to sell tickets to his concerts for very low prices because he wanted ordinary working men and women to be able to afford them. What actually happened: Ticket resellers bought up all the tickets. So a ticket with a face value of $30 went for $100, except $70 of that went to a third party. At some point it occurred to Springsteen that if tickets to his shows were selling for $100, it didn’t make a lot of sense for $70 of that to go to a middleman who not only didn’t write “Born to Run,” he didn’t even write “Workin’ on a Dream.” Years ago, Springsteen dropped his “friend of the working man” pricing policy, which is why the last time I went to one of his concerts the face value of the ticket was $350. Is Springsteen guilty of “price gouging” for denying ticket resellers the opportunity to make gigantic profits from his work and artistry? Were those resellers guilty of “price gouging” for selling those tickets for what people were willing to pay?Costco doesn’t do this because of what economists call “good will,” which essentially means “fear of bad publicity propagated by economic illiterates.” So what does Costco do instead? It sells products for their everyday prices, creating the potential for a secondary market if shelves are empty. In other words, things that people are desperate to get are on sale for the same old price, except . . . you can’t find them anywhere. Thinking through this matter calls for the wisdom of Bruce Springsteen.
But capitalism is especially useful in a crisis, when there is market disruption. When times turn dark, capitalism is, more than ever, your friend. Let’s say stores run out of toilet paper or hand sanitizer or diesel fuel because of panic buying during the age of COVID-19, and no one can find these items in stores. Why people are punching each other over the Charmin while leaving the Robitussin and Tylenol alone is a mystery, but that is of no moment. What matters is that toilet paper is suddenly more valuable simply because demand has surged. That means people are bidding up the price. Or they would be, if the stores allowed this. If Costco quadrupled the price of whatever item is selling out, there wouldn’t be any shortages of anything. Market pricing would restore normal functioning.My colleague John Hirschauer Good news, friends! We already have Jimmy Stewart. He’s right here among us. Only his name is “market pricing.”Wouldn’t it be wonderful if someone trustworthy and courteous and concerned with the common good could stand in front of the registers at Costco calming people’s fears and successfully urging them to buy only what they actually need? Someone as folksy and good-hearted as, say, Jimmy Stewart during the scene in which there’s a run on the Building and Loan (i.e. bank) in <span class=""drop"">Y</span>

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.© The Sanders chapter is over. The general election has begun. The last thing we need is more debates about Democratic Party direction.Letting Sanders pull him leftward, which Biden did somewhat on Sunday night on issues such as immigration and fracking, would be a huge mistake. He should have used every opportunity to turn the question to the imperative of replacing Trump, which is the unifying message for all of Biden’s potential voters.But Biden isn’t them. He’s running as vanilla ice cream. Vanilla ice cream is the most popular flavor not because it’s everyone’s favorite, but because it’s the least objectionable flavor.In the past, once nominees of either party locked up the nomination, they tacked to the center. Barack Obama and Donald Trump didn’t need to do that for reasons unique to them.Biden didn’t seem to fully grasp this dynamic. He seemed to be under the impression that his top priority is to win over Sanders’s voters, even though his historic comeback is entirely attributable to the fact that voters see him as a viable alternative to Sanders. Biden will never get the socialist die-hards, and attempting to do so risks both losing the suburban moderates who came out for him in droves and giving President Trump the very line of attack he desperately wants.When asked how he’d deal with the economic consequences of the pandemic, Sanders used it as an opportunity to replay his greatest hits on income inequality. That’s a message many Democrats may agree with, particularly when the economy is roaring. But when it is grinding to a halt because of a public-health emergency, they probably want to hear more immediate and practical solutions, not ideological ax-grinding.Sanders also repeatedly attacked the “health-care industry” — not just insurers, but the whole system — which seems rather tone-deaf given that this very industry is on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis. It was like denouncing the military during a war.It fell to Biden to point out that the Italians have a single-payer system that hasn’t prevented the calamity befalling them. That’s not to say that it’s made things worse, either. The reason Italy is in such a mess is that it didn’t take the threat seriously in the beginning. Sound familiar?“Let’s be honest and understand that this coronavirus pandemic exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunction of our current health-care system,” Sanders said.That effort is one of the reasons Sanders lost. The message discipline that served him so well until now suddenly made him seem not only disconnected from the crisis at hand but determined to exploit it for an agenda ill-suited to deal with it.But more to the point, Biden doesn’t need to engage with Sanders anymore. He’s history. When Biden destroyed Sanders on Super Tuesday, Sanders became what he’s always been at heart: a single-issue candidate. It didn’t seem that way until now because it looked like he might win the nomination. But now, Sanders is doing what issue candidates always try to do: force his priorities on the party.Senatorial arguments are always awful — “I called the question on the motion to recommit the amendment to the committee of jurisdiction long before you did!” And on Sunday, these two old senators brought the same kind of bickering to the debate stage. At times, their old-man senatorial arguments sounded like a mix of Robert’s Rules of Order and a row over how much to leave as a tip on the early-bird specials at the Boca Raton Ruby Tuesday.
But saying that Biden won doesn’t mean the debate was scintillating.What seemed like disciplined, surgical strikes in Sanders’s previous performances came across more like repetitive canned answers in a one-on-one matchup. Indeed, for the first 45 minutes, Sanders seemed more like an old man past his prime than Biden did.The conventional wisdom from the previous ten debates was that Biden benefited from getting so little time on a crowded stage because the time constraints limited opportunities for gaffes and Bidenisms. But it turned out that having more time to air one’s views worked against Sanders more than Biden.That might seem like counterintuitive advice given that Biden won Sunday night’s debate decisively. But Biden doesn’t need to debate anymore. There’s supposed to be another round in April, but there’s nothing stopping the Democratic Party from canceling that. Everything else is getting canceled, after all.<span class=""drop"">M</span>

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span> Though no policy is a free lunch, such temporary and targeted assistance seems like a better and less risky response during these panicked times than mandates and tax credits delayed for weeks on end.This program would need to be strictly time limited — it is not intended to be permanent.Employers would continue to pay workers who are prevented from working by the virus, through direct deposits or paychecks in the mail. They would report this to their state UI system, which would reimburse them through tax credits or direct payments and would in turn be reimbursed by the federal government. . .Incidentally, a few weeks ago, Jared Bernstein and his co-author The spread of the coronavirus is a serious problem. But this crisis shouldn’t serve as an excuse to implement poorly designed policies such as this one. In fact, the more severe the crisis, the more caution is required, because the stakes are higher. Congress doesn’t seem to care, as they seem eager to support everything from bailouts to sending $1,000 checks to everyone without exception to a large paid-leave provision.This bill is now heading to the Senate, where it could be made worse, especially if senators extend the leave provision further, as the president suggested yesterday.That’s good for small employers, franchises, and health-care employers. But how does that work? If it is on a case-by-case basis, the result could be a nightmare for those attempting to get exemptions. Also, what does it mean for sick employees?<span style=""font-size: 1.25rem;"">The Secretary of Labor is given the authority to issue regulations for good cause to: (1) exclude certain health care providers and emergency responders from the definition of eligible employee; and, (2) exempt employers with fewer than 50 employees from the requirements of Division C if such requirements would jeopardize the viability of the business as a going concern.</span><span style=""font-size: 1.25rem;"">As the bill stands now, it would empower the Department of Labor in this way: </span>And the cost of all of this, assuming that it really ends in 2020, is $104 billion according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. I assume we are financing all of this by adding on to our existing debt. It goes without saying that we would have been in a much better position to handle this extra spending — and everything else that Congress has in mind — had Uncle Sam practiced some fiscal austerity in the past.On top of these problems is the fact that the payments from the federal government to companies will take the form of delayed tax credits. These delays in payments are likely to be a significant burden on companies, especially small businesses and franchises. Think about it this way: Employers could have to pay their absent employees for up to twelve weeks, only to get a tax credit months down the road. Not great.In the original version, all the workers who received paid sick time would be eligible for another 10 weeks of paid leave at two-thirds pay, in what would have represented a major expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the 1993 law that provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave to workers at larger companies.But it could have been worse, as the The bill adds to those two weeks of sick leave another ten weeks of paid leave at two-thirds of employee pay for workers caring for children whose school or day-care has been shut down. This may make life easier for some employees, but at a dire cost to their employers.  Ten weeks of leave, on top of the other two weeks, means that employers could have to face significant and prolonged absences of their employees, making it harder for firms to meet their customers’ demands and to generate the revenues necessary to remain in operation.Second, the bill doesn’t just target the benefits to workers who don’t currently have sick leave or those who are actually sick. As it stands right now, it requires that companies with fewer than 500 employees extend two weeks of paid-sick leave at 100 percent of employees’ pay to all workers First, the bill mandates both paid sick- and family-leave benefits for companies with fewer than 500 employees (some exemptions apply). While it only applies to coronavirus-related sick leaves taken during the next twelve months, I am concerned that once the crisis passes, Republicans may face intense pressure to make this change permanent. Democrats have long wanted to get this done. This could be their chance. Don Boudreaux and I Unfortunately, the one paid-leave proposal going through Congress at the moment doesn’t quite fit that description. The bill, called the Family First Coronavirus Response Act, passed the House last night without much resistance, as legislators are eager to do something, anything. It will likely face very little pushback in the Senate, especially since it has received the president’s endorsement. Below are some of the bill’s most problematic aspects.Most people agree that those who are sick should not go to work, both for their own welfare and to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others. One implication of this is that we must find a way to extend sick leave temporarily to workers who do not already have this benefit, but without imposing too much of a burden on their employers, who are likely already hurting right now.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Never Let a Crisis Go to Waste

No charge.We’ll be fortunate if, at some point in the not too distant future, we can look back on this month and say our fears were overblown and the steps we took to fight the virus were too draconian. For now, though, extreme measures certainly seem justified given the outcomes being projected by epidemiologists. If you aren’t particularly scared by the coronavirus, I congratulate you. But I am.More than 9/11, the virus brings to mind what will soon, I suppose, be a forgotten footnote to history: the bizarre bioterrorism campaign in which a series of anthrax-laced letters, sent through the mail, killed five people and sickened 17 others. Like the destruction of the World Trade Center, the anthrax scare was right in my face. Two of those injured in the attack worked at NBC and the I was quite sure no one in my home wanted to kill me after 9/11. Today, I don’t even know whether I myself am carrying the virus. A killer could be in my lungs right now. Even in its mild form, the virus could put me and everyone else in my household through a week or more of nasty illness. Even if I have no symptoms whatsoever, I could pass it along to a family member who could suffer. I could pass it to my daughter, who has asthma. I could pick up the virus from a park bench or a subway pole or a checkout counter at the grocery store. After 9/11, my mood was somber but my daily life was pretty much exactly the same as before, and except for a few days of disruption, New York City went on almost exactly as before. Today the city is all but shuttered. My family routines have been turned inside out. And none of us knows how long all of this disruption will last.There’s a strong possibility that COVID-19 will kill far more than 3,000 New Yorkers, and it will certainly kill far more than 3,000 Americans. It seems likely to inflict more economic damage than 9/11 also. But these are measurable factors. How do you measure fear? Perhaps my memories have faded so much that they’re misleading me, but I believe I felt nothing like today’s level of fear in the fall of 2001. Terrorism can be checked, sometimes even foiled. An invisible pathogen, potentially coming to claim more lives than al-Qaeda did on 9/11, can’t be turned away by metal detectors or be shot by police; it doesn’t have its bags checked at the door. Unlike a man in a suicide vest, a virus isn’t an extreme rarity but a natural, ordinary life form. Unlike Mohammed Atta and Co., it can be and kill everywhere at once, and it doesn’t have to die in the process.I wasn’t disoriented or even really redirected by fear, though. America immediately stiffened up antiterrorism measures at transportation hubs, so it seemed like a copycat attack would have been extremely difficult to pull off. And as for a smaller-scale assault, I didn’t particularly fear that either. Call me blithe, but I thought it tremendously unlikely that a man in a suicide vest would show up in whatever restaurant or subway car I happened to be in at any given moment. What I felt after 9/11 was mourning and sadness, with only a manageable level of fear for the future beneath it.I was a few blocks north of the Twin Towers when they fell, and I well remember the grim, aching, heavy mood that settled over New York City afterward. Even six miles north of Ground Zero, where I lived and still do, the putrid burning-tire scent was unmistakable for weeks. And that almost literal cloud of death was matched by a dark cloud of mourning. Bars and restaurants were notably underpopulated. Parties were canceled. All over downtown Manhattan there were dizzying, heartbreaking handbills. People randomly pasted to walls and fences photographs of their missing loved ones, as though any survivors of the World Trade Center attacks would have failed to contact their families as soon as possible.<span class=""drop"">O</span>

I’m not a health and disease expert, and no matter how much I read, things seem to be changing far too often for me to know exactly what to do  It’s not that the government should be doing nothing, of course, but I think it’s important to also highlight the instances in which its “help” with combating this virus has come in the form of its getting out of the way. I also want to recognize all of the work that civilians and private companies have been doing to try to solve this issue independent of the state. Just yesterday, for example, billionaire entrepreneur I could never, for the life of me, understand how often the people who clamor for tighter restrictions on speech are the same ones who also cry that President Trump is a racist, sexist, modern-day Hitler. They want to give the government more control over what they can and cannot say, even though they think that the leader of its executive branch is a monster; how does that make sense? It’s the same thing here: In many cases, it’s the people shouting that the government has handled this crisis with incompetence who are also shouting that the same government should be more involved going forward.Even the state of Massachusetts — home of Senator Elizabeth Warren, hardly known for its lax regulations — has decided to loosen one of its own laws by temporarily allowing medical professionals from other states to practice there. This is, as Cato’s Worse, the problems that have been created by the government aren’t limited to testing restrictions, either. How many times, for example, have you heard about the hand-sanitizer shortage? It’s been in the news for quite some time, and yet it wasn’t What’s more, it wasn’t until Friday that the In February, she decided she couldn’t wait any longer and did it anyway — and quickly found a positive test for a local teenager who hadn’t traveled anywhere, clear evidence of community spread. Even though she had broken the rules, she did what she felt was the right thing and informed local health officials about her discovery. In response, the federal government told her to stop testing immediately, which allowed the situation to get worse when it could have been getting better.It’s good that this has finally happened, but it should have happened sooner — and it
For example: The FDA has Furthermore, there’s also the issue of the way that existing government regulations have, in some cases, actually made things worse here in the United States.First of all, remember this: Italy has a single-payer health-care system, and the coronavirus has been a disaster there all the same. In fact, It’s common, of course, for big-government liberals to argue that the mere existence of a problem equals a need for greater government involvement. This is a logical fallacy in many cases, and a lot of evidence suggests that this may be one of them.<span class=""drop"">B</span>

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>My final point is that we all need to be more willing to ask questions and demand accountability from those in power. After all, these are the same people who have been fighting a counterproductive trade war for months, have jacked up the deficit in time of economic expansion, were supposed to oversee the agencies that we now know In that vein, while we should be having a debate about whether to bail out the airline or other industries, it is inappropriate for Senator Elizabeth Warren to demand that companies, as a condition for receiving government assistance, must implement a $15 minimum wage within a year, and turn one board seat over to workers. Such demands are economically ignorant and politically opportunistic that in this of all times ought to be especially denounced. Besides, this will make it harder to get out of the economic mess when the public-health scare has passed.I would like also to remind legislators that this is not the time to push your previous ideological agendas. For instance, a look the House Democrats’ third coronavirus bill reveals that this bill is an attempt to push everything they have It is true that the federal government is in a better place to do this than is any other institution. It has a unique ability to borrow at low interest rates and to extract a gusher of tax revenues (thanks to its reliance on one of the most productive economies on earth). But even this government will eventually hit a limit. And that limit may come sooner than later. After all, all wealth is created in the private sector. How do you spend more real resources over the long run while shutting the economy down?This important debate is one that I don’t see Congress having right now. Instead, politicians’ answer has been and continues to be: Dump as much cash as we can as soon as we can into the economy, and think later.There is some logic to this. I also get the idea that if the Treasury sends every American a check for $1,000, in many cases it will In something of a contrast, George Mason University’s Tyler Cowen, in an interview with Cochrane also makes other excellent points.People need help too, and our politicians have figured that out. Once again, loans are better than gifts. Rather than give each of us $1,000, allow us to borrow a fraction of last year’s income from the Internal Revenue Service and repay when we file our taxes. That provides more money to those who need it, and helps those even with large debts not to default. Allow penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts. Social-program rules must be stretched. If people have to lose a job to get help, we tempt the employer to needlessly fire them, and they and the employer are not ready to start up again fast.Lending is better than transfers. Since loans must be paid back, larger amounts can go where needed. Small Business Administration loans are a good start. But most business and most employment is large business. Large firms are often even more cash-poor and in hock to nervous creditors, and they are harder to replace or revive if they fail. Lend with the head, not the heart. “People” might seem more worthy than “corporations,” but we need corporations to hire people when it’s over…I recommend So what As for the economic issues we face, there are, for now, many things about this recession that distinguish it fundamentally from past economic crises. This fact means that attempts to buoy the economy by using traditional fiscal and monetary tools will not work, at least not during the first stage of today’s crisis.As I mentioned in It is not to say that the government shouldn’t act. But it means legislators, the administration, and those in the orbit of government rule makers must proceed with extreme caution and humility. There is a lot There is a frenzy of rule-making right now. Obviously, some of it is important as it may help calm American workers, business owners, and investors. But we should always remember that even in normal times, the government makes a lot of bad decisions. Emergencies and the resulting panic will not improve the government’s batting average on this front. It will only make it worse.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Will We Survive the Washington Stimulus Panic?

Advertisement<strong>RR:</strong><strong>DT:</strong><strong>RR:</strong><strong>DT:</strong><strong>RR: </strong><strong>DT:</strong>And then the issue is, where do you draw the line? Everybody who owes money — airlines, indebted students, restaurants — can make a similar case for assistance. Do we have enough money to avoid this downward spiral? That’s going to be a tough political and social challenge when we’re already running a very large budget deficit at the federal level. The irresponsibility of Congress and the president over the last seven or eight years means that we don’t have a lot of wiggle room.In the case of banks, that remains a problem, because banks should theoretically have some kind of extra cushion for worst-case scenarios that cannot be anticipated. Even though in this case the banks didn’t lend recklessly, you could argue that every bank should have some bigger cushion than they otherwise might think is necessary to avoid this kind of ruin. So there’s a cost there. But that ship sailed long ago. No bank in America or in any developed country right now is sufficiently capitalized for a shock of this magnitude.<strong>RR:</strong><strong>DT:</strong><strong>RR:</strong>  
   <strong>DT:</strong>  
   The main thing to look at is employment, not unemployment. How many Americans are earning a paycheck? Many service providers can work from home. Many cannot. The ones who cannot, who don’t keep their job because of the worries about the virus, they’re not going to be producing anything. So the so-called stimulus is likely to flow into areas that are fairly healthy. Netflix is going to be fine. My podcast is going to keep on going. For people who can’t telecommute, all the stimulus spending in the world isn’t going to help. If we run out of toilet paper, having more money in your pocket is not going to help you get toilet paper, it’s going to bid up the price of the existing toilet paper.<strong>RR:</strong><strong>DT:</strong><strong>RR:</strong><strong>DT:</strong><strong>RR:</strong><strong>DT:</strong>What we want to avoid — if possible — is ripple effects in production of 
Within that worst-case scenario, there are two scopes of harm. In the first case, a bunch of industries basically shut down — sports, travel, entertainment, restaurants. That’s going to have a horrible ripple effect on the economy. I spoke to someone who owns real estate — apartment buildings, offices — if the people who live in his apartment can’t pay their rent because they don’t have a job, he is not going to be able to pay his mortgage. We’re going to get something akin to what we had in 2008, which is a nasty downward spiral of economic activity.The worst-case scenario is something closer to Italy, where there is a rapid increase in cases and deaths. If that happens, there’s going to be a vivid response both from the government and the private sector. Businesses are going to furlough or lay off workers, either because they’re sick or because workers can’t be near other people.The best-case scenario is that we flatten the curve through social distancing and reducing gatherings through sports, schools, and so on, which we’re doing now. The rate of growth of new cases slows, the peak comes later rather than sooner, and the disruptions are small. That would be similar to South Korea. But they got to the best-case scenario through much more aggressive testing than we have been able to achieve, so it’s hard to know if that’s even feasible.<strong>Russ Roberts:</strong><strong>Daniel Tenreiro:</strong><span class=""drop"">R</span>

Thompson did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Health would not comment beyond reiterating that no state workers performed screenings at the hotel.[ACU spokesman Ian] Walters said that ACU chairman Dan Schneider was informed by Maryland health official Ruth Thompson last Sunday, March 8, that state workers had conducted 2,000 screenings around the hotel in the wake of CPAC.

If the coronavirus had popped up in the early 1990s, we would be all stuck talking on landlines to each other — and medical and pharmaceutical technology wouldn’t be what it is today.Everything that we’re currently enduring would be worse without the Internet. Without it, we wouldn’t be getting nearly as much information nearly as quickly. Our ability to look up what doctors are saying would be nil. Our ability to know what the coronavirus is doing in other countries would be limited to foreign correspondents. Our knowledge about the crisis we’re facing would be limited to what we could find out from the television, the radio, newspapers, and magazines.<strong>Practicing Safe Social-Media Distancing</strong>On the menu today: trying to keep a cool head on one’s shoulders when there’s a serious public-health crisis and a social-media environment that rewards hyperbole and drama, figuring out why so many members of the U.S. media are quick to defend the good name of the Chinese government, an update on CPAC, and a funny video about teaching your kids at home that feels just a little too real right now.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Internet and Social Media in the Age of Coronavirus

It may already be here.The lesson is not that we should do away with cities. Nor could we. Government policy and social attitudes operate only around the margins of large trends, such as urbanization, anyway. The majority-agrarian society of Thomas Jefferson’s ideal is not coming back. But after the experience of moving large segments of our workforce to home-based work on short notice, we should give more thought to the benefits of walkable towns and smaller cities where more people can work from or near home among smaller crowds of their fellow man. We should consider the reduction of our dependence on megacities to concentrate business and life in dense, high-cost, low-social-distance areas. Smaller urban areas can promote not only more individual independence and security, but also greater community of the sort our society has been losing as it increasingly atomizes in larger cities.The accumulation of jobs in big cities has also undermined the environmental and lifestyle promise of urbanization due to “suburban sprawl,” the large stretches of outlying bedroom communities whose residents must endure long commutes to reach their jobs. Time spent in transit is a deadweight economic and quality-of-life loss, and driving cars to avoid mass transit only exacerbates pollution and traffic accidents. Urban life’s boosters blame this on suburbia, but the underlying cause is that too many jobs are concentrated in small spaces that are prohibitively expensive to live in, especially for families who want the living space offered by suburbia. Most suburbanites would gladly keep their houses and ditch the commute to work closer to home. The quarantine life may teach them how much of their jobs could be done without the commute.  
   Subway and train systems, for all their benefits, can be incapacitated by attacks on their controls and stations in ways that cars cannot. Satellite-guided self-driving cars would face the same problem without human autonomy to free them from the vulnerabilities of centralization. Our reliance on over-concentrated satellite and Internet networks in general should be evaluated. The more distributed our sources of authority, control, communication, and transportation are, the less vulnerable we are to any sort of natural or man-made decapitation strike.A little over four score years later, that was no longer true of America’s rebels. The Confederacy made Richmond its capital, and both combatants bent much of their military strategy around its capture or defense, in large part because the Confederacy’s industrial capacity was so heavily concentrated in one city. Lose the Tredegar Iron Works, lose the war. Robert E. Lee’s army surrendered a week after Richmond fell.  
   The American Revolution, in contrast to the French, dragged on for seven years. At one point or another, the then-principal cities of most of the colonies — Massachusetts (Boston), Pennsylvania (Philadelphia), New York (New York), Virginia (Williamsburg, Richmond, and Charlottesville), Rhode Island (Newport), South Carolina (Charleston), Georgia (Savannah), Delaware (Wilmington) and New Jersey (Trenton, Princeton, Perth Amboy, and New Brunswick) — were captured and occupied by the British. But in a country where no one city was essential, none of those captures ended the fight.
Historically, nations have also been more vulnerable to internal unrest and external invasion if they relied on one or two large metropolitan areas as a nerve center. In France, for example, taking Paris has always brought the rest of the nation to its knees. From 1789 to 1848, the Parisian mob could bring down governments and impose its will on the countryside. Napoleon, schooled in decisive battles for capital cities, invaded Russia expecting that he could do the same and was startled to learn that capturing Moscow earned him nothing while his opponents retreated into Russia’s vast expanse.  Baron Haussman, the great redesigner of Paris in the 1850s and 1860s, rebuilt it around broad boulevards, whose beauty for strolling tourists camouflaged their true purpose in affording long fields of fire for French artillery to clear the streets of unruly Parisians. That reduced the internal threat of mob rule, but, ironically, helped German armies end national resistance by capturing Paris in 1871 and 1940.Disease is far from the only risk of concentrating people and critical institutions in crowded spaces. Terrorist attacks are disproportionately aimed at cities, where easy targets range from landmark buildings (the World Trade Center) to packed trains (Madrid). Natural disasters and blackouts are more costly and dangerous when they hit the biggest cities. Hurricane Katrina was vastly more damaging to New Orleans than to the rest of the Gulf Coast, in part because many of the city’s residents did not own cars and could not evacuate under their own power.But the dark side of urbanization has always included infectious disease. Humans did not evolve to live in such close proximity. Close physical contact spreads germs, which is why medieval and early-modern cities were so pestilential. London became the first city to break two million people in the early 1800s, and it suffered terrible outbreaks of cholera (then a brand-new disease) in the following decades. While sanitation has solved many of the old problems of disease, apartment buildings and mass transit still force people together in much closer quarters than houses and cars.  And today, the most densely packed Western cities face the greatest risk, with Paris and San Francisco taking the extreme step of “shelter-in-place” orders, and New York’s mayor openly pondering the same thing.There are undoubted advantages to urban life. Concentrating large numbers of people in small areas means larger workforces with more diverse skills, easier access to mass transit, and economies of scale in everything from public services to cultural institutions, such as museums and sports teams. Even the things that let us stay at home — from internet service to grocery and take-out delivery — are easier to get in cities. Those dynamics explain much of why this is a longstanding global phenomenon.The relentless march of urbanization, in the United States and around the world, has been coming for a long time. Using the Census Bureau’s expansive definition of an “urban area” as 2,500 or more people, America went from <span class=""drop"">C</span>

Perhaps sending Americans $1000 government-stimulus checks, instituting temporary sick- and family-leave pay as an emergency measure to keep families afloat, and bailing out our hardest-hit industries makes some sense, too, but not all ideas are equally beneficial in all situations.Yet the coronavirus crisis has only strengthened my belief in limited-government conservatism — classical liberalism, libertarianism, whatever you want to call it.

While building such a hospital is a tall order, many state CON laws simply prohibit facilities from adding extra beds or equipment or transferring beds or equipment to other facilities. Unfortunately, certificate-of-need (CON) laws prohibit hospitals from increasing their capacity without receiving approval from a board that often has interests in limiting supply. We must untangle this red tape to save lives. Hospitals and medical facilities in hotspots already are overwhelmed with patients, and the demands placed on them will only increase in the coming months.

   There is a chance that the coronavirus outbreak could end up being a relatively minor disturbance to the geopolitical status quo, an urgent blip after which the world returns, eventually, to business as usual. However, the effects of this global pandemic could also help solidify some correction to the current model of globalization. This correction need not be a Cold War 2.0, or a replay of the great disintegration that happened during the First World War, in which great-power competition unleashed a torrent of mayhem and misery. Countries might hold out a place for trade and migration while also placing a new emphasis on their internal social and economic infrastructures. The United States, for instance, could simultaneously engage in a more energetic form of industrial policy while also trading with nations across the globe (as countries such as South Korea and China already do). A more robust effort to renew the American industrial base and working class might actually help prevent a radical global retrenchment; a United States with a stronger internal infrastructure could better meet its international commitments.In the United States and elsewhere, the COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted some of the choices entailed in the current iteration of globalization. The risk of real shortages for medical supplies has done more to convince policymakers of the importance of domestic industrial production than a thousand white papers have. Moreover, this outbreak has renewed the tensions between the United States and the People’s Republic of China. Donald Trump’s election signified a shift toward an increased hawkishness toward China, but this trend has accelerated, prompted in part by the Chinese leadership — who have spread the false claim that the United States — and not Wuhan — was the origin of COVID-19. Many analysts already saw American dependence on the PRC for many key goods as a threat to the continued ability of the United States to engage in great-power politics, but this view has gained increased currency over the past month.In recent years, defenders of the neoliberal order have taken to venting their anger at the political factions that have sprung up in response to neoliberal dislocations — “populists,” “nationalists,” Brexiteers, and, of course, Donald Trump. Yet these political actors have gained a foothold precisely because of the tensions that neoliberalism heightened: the economic frustrations of a financializing economy, the disruptions of mass migration, the polarization between the professional classes and blue-collar workers, and so forth.High neoliberalism already had a preexisting health condition, and this global pandemic may be fatal for it. World trade as a percentage of global GDP peaked in 2008, after which the financial crisis made it plummet. It has climbed closer to that historic high, but the coronavirus outbreak seems likely to send that number downward again. Harder borders are springing up around the world, with even free-movement havens such as the Schengen Area being divided. For the moment, at least, coronavirus has severely curtailed the free movement of goods and people that is at the heart of many neoliberal dreams.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>The coronavirus crisis may be jostling existing political coalitions. It has perhaps dispelled the totem of austerity that has hung over Republican politics (or at least political rhetoric) for so long. While Republican presidents from Reagan onward have long expressed an indifference to balanced budgets in governing, the GOP response to this crisis has by and large avoided even a A raft of subsidies, low-interest loans, and other supports seems in the offing for American businesses, and that crucial injection of capital may come with certain strings. For instance, some in Congress have called for making aid to some businesses contingent on relocating supply chains to the United States. If the other policy aims are bundled into various relief efforts, that could have long-lasting implications for American economic policies and political dynamics. The absence of policy strings could also be a cause for disruption. After all, the frustrations resulting from the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis — including the lack of reforms to end Too Big to Fail — have helped fuel the unrest of pre-COVID politics.U.S. politics will likely not be the same. So much money will be spent, and the federal government is taking such sweeping action across a host of sectors, from banking to medical licensing to industrial production. Federal power often grows during times of crisis, and this case is no exception. The United States is experiencing perhaps the most extensive exercise of (relatively) coordinated state power since the Second World War.  Even the aftermath of 9/11 seems restrained in comparison. Across the country, states and municipalities are closing down businesses, shuttering schools, and imposing curfews for extended periods.It’s hard to say what this change will ultimately mean, in part because we don’t know exactly how high coronavirus’s ultimate costs in both lives and GDP will be, how long it will last, or what eventual steps the United States will take to face it. However, some possible consequences stand out.But the past ten days or so have undone that exhaustion-through-microtitillation. Now, things are moving fast, so fast that perhaps no one understands what’s really been done, let alone where we’re going. On cable news, some talking heads try doggedly to slip back into the accustomed pattern, as though whether we call COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” is really the most pressing issue facing the country. And that’s understandable; the feuds we know might be more comforting than challenges unsolved.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

No charge.There should be permanent closure of the wet markets, given the government’s obvious inability or unwillingness to regulate them. Such a comprehensive approach would be a reversal of decades of government policy and market practice, but when we get through this crisis and the toll it will take on the world, we will owe it to the memory of those we lose that there be a global, sustained push to see these practices ended, everywhere.So far, we may just be seeing a repeat of the “crackdown” after the SARS epidemic, which was quickly and quietly lifted. We do not know the nature of the current ban. And can we even trust Beijing to keep such bans in place, particularly with a slowing economy and persistent rural poverty? Also, what exactly is banned? It should be all aspects of the wild-animal trade — breeding, transporting, and marketing.We should be skeptical about reports of a crackdown on the wild-animal industry in the wake of the Wuhan catastrophe. We don’t know any details about the new laws that have been reported. What will be the enforcement and discipline? Law enforcement in rural China is notoriously lax, in contrast to the cities, where the use of surveillance technology and other means to control the population is widespread. What is the posture toward Chinese medicine, which is a significant driver of the wild-animal industry? While thousands of such wet markets have been closed, how did we get to 2020 with such practices in a city larger than the largest U.S. city?Wet markets and commingling with wild animals have created much misery for the Chinese and for the world. Sixty million Americans caught the H1N1 “swine flu” virus in 2009, while the SARS outbreak killed nearly 800 people worldwide. The COVID-19 death toll is already multiples of that.
Over time, this led to the breeding and distribution of these animals, and small rural outposts developed into larger-scale operations. Add to this the use of wild animals not only for consumption but as the supposedly magic ingredients in tonics and alternative medicines, and it is obvious that what began as subsistence farming for the rural poor has developed into a substantial industry. Wuhan, a city most Americans had never heard of before this year, is larger than New York City.Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, in the late 1970s lifted state controls on rural farming to allow peasant farmers to provide for their own sustenance. Rats, bats, civet cats, pangolins, and other wild animals became staples of rural farming. To acknowledge and even encourage this, the government enacted laws that protected “the lawful rights of those engaged in the development or utilization of wildlife resources.”The wild animals that mix with more common livestock — poultry, swine, and seafood — form a deadly combination. And, as has been well reported by Wet markets are found the world over, typically open-air sites selling fresh meat, seafood, and produce. The meats often are butchered and trimmed on-site. Markets in China have come in for justifiable condemnation because of the way they’ve evolved, commingling traditional livestock with a wide variety of wild animals, including exotic and endangered species. Many are quite unsanitary, with blood, entrails, excrement, and other waste creating the conditions for disease that migrates from animals to people through virus, bacteria, and other forms of transmission. Such “zoonotic diseases” that have emerged from China and other regions of the world include Ebola, HIV, bird flu, swine flu, and SARS.After the SARS outbreak in 2003, which was traced to a wet market in the southern Guangdong Province, a temporary ban on wet markets and the wild-animal industry were put in place. In July of that year, the World Health Organization declared the SARS virus contained, and in August the Chinese government lifted the ban.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

Advertisement<em>© 2020 Tribune Content Agency LLC</em> I have no idea how to short-circuit the collective action problem in front of us. But I worry that things could continue to deteriorate in such a way that the worst consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic won’t be matters of public health or economics, but an escalating cold war that could turn hot.But the fact remains that the Chinese people will get a very different message than the one the Trump administration intends. Thanks to Chinese censorship and state-controlled media, the Chinese people will get only the message the Chinese government wants them to get. And that message is that the blame for their problems doesn’t belong with their own corrupt government, but with the West.So is the Trump administration’s determination to fight back on this. I’m actually sympathetic to the need to rebut China’s propaganda campaign. I can see the case that Trump has no choice, even if I think the way he talks about it is sloppy.What worries me about the current brouhaha over what to call the virus is that everyone is playing into Xi’s hands. The mainstream media’s ridiculous obsession with proving President Trump is racist because he calls it the “Chinese coronavirus” is perfectly in sync with the Chinese propaganda effort.As the social cohesion of economic growth has ebbed, the Chinese — specifically the Han Chinese — have doubled down on jingoism. Part of their strategy is to emphasize the infallibility of the government in general, but of President Xi in particular. That’s why they’re pushing a major propaganda effort to claim that COVID-19 was unleashed on China by the U.S. military. It’s also why the surest ticket to jail (or worse) in China these days is to publicly call into question Xi’s response to the virus.Chinese president Xi Jinping already did that. But he’s catching up to Putin in other ways.While everyone in the West has been focused on the pandemic, Putin has been orchestrating a constitutional change that will essentially make him president-for-life.This has been Russian president Vladimir Putin’s modus operandi for decades. His economy in tatters and the political system corrupt, Putin has held on to power in part by convincing the Russian people that they are besieged from abroad. “The West” is trying to destroy Mother Russia, and only a strong man like him can protect the homeland.The scary part is that the Chinese government has seen the writing on the wall for a while now. Not only has it become more authoritarian than even a decade ago; it has become more nationalist.In America, policymakers in both parties see this as the last straw for an arrangement they didn’t like anyway. That means even more factories could be leaving China, never to return.But in the last few years, Chinese economic growth has slowed, even according to China’s own unreliable numbers. The economic shocks of the coronavirus, which first emerged in Wuhan, are hitting everybody, but China may have the most lasting problems.For the past few decades, stability and social peace have been maintained by incredible economic growth. It’s easier to keep the masses happy, or at least compliant, when most are either getting richer or believe their kids will.Moreover, China simply has an enormous number of people, which must be intimidating for the aristocrats in the perches.It also has an enormous number of very poor people, which can be destabilizing when you have considerable income inequality and corruption, which China also has.
There are many reasons that China’s rulers fear the ruled. Historically, the transition from dictatorship to democracy is led by a large middle class. A prosperous middle class, no longer worried about simple survival, tends to demand representation in government, the rule of law, and other staples of democracy. China now has an enormous middle class.“In 2013 the party issued a list of seven topics that could no longer be discussed with students: universal values, a free press, civil society, civic rights, the party’s past ‘mistakes,’ corruption and an independent judiciary,” veteran China correspondent Isabel Hilton wrote in If the people were all in for their form of government and their way of life, this wouldn’t be necessary.Think about it. Why would a government place secret cameras everywhere? Censor any criticism of the government? Mount massive propaganda campaigns to defend the infallibility of the ruling Communist Party?<span class=""drop"">I</span>

The cake is good judgment and an ability to understand the duties of the office and the complicated, ever-changing world we live in.The presidency is not primarily a job about being entertaining on television. Since the rise of television, the most pivotal moments of the American presidency have occurred far from the television cameras: John F Kennedy and his cabinet, trying to avoid Armageddon during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The suspicion is that because of confidential briefings, the senator knew that an economic earthquake was coming to world markets and cashed in based upon inside information.The statement from Burr’s spokesman doesn’t really help him much at all: “Senator Burr filed a financial disclosure form for personal transactions made several weeks before the U.S. and financial markets showed signs of volatility due to the growing coronavirus outbreak.”We don’t often see <strong>Speaking of Public Trust . . .</strong>You also have to wonder what we’re not seeing. Russia only suffered its first death this week, If that is indeed what we are dealing with, then all of these measures that seem extreme make sense; this coronavirus is a once-in-a-century threat to public health. The report prepared by Imperial College epidemiologist Neil Ferguson Inaccurate statements do far more damage, because that suggests that the leaders don’t really know what’s going on, or they do know what’s going on, and are afraid to tell the public because it’s so bad. Forewarned is forearmed.It’s difficult to overstate the importance of elected officials and public-health officials being honest with the public about what they see, what they think, what they know, and what they don’t know. It is okay for a leader to admit he or his team doesn’t know something. It is much preferable to hear uncertainty than to hear something inaccurate. An answer of “I don’t know,” is honest, and forces people to be prepared for worse scenarios than the present.<strong>Now Is the Time for Honesty — Even If It Is Uncomfortable</strong>On the menu today: why leaders in the United States — and around the world — need to be honest with the public during this crisis, especially when it’s uncomfortable; serious questions about senators’ stock sales before the coronavirus hit; the importance of speed when it comes to economic aid; and the end of the era of political leaders as a form of entertainment.National ReviewFollow Us",0,A Time for Honesty

No charge.Since last week, the president has begun to deliver daily briefings to the press, sharing the latest news on how the administration is addressing the crisis. At the end of last week, Trump declared a national state of emergency and expanded the travel ban for those coming to the U.S. from Europe. He also has signed an economic-relief bill to ensure free testing for COVID-19, increased availability of unemployment insurance, and additional food aid for low-income Americans.Interestingly, while approval of Trump’s handling of the crisis has risen, his overall approval ratings have remained nearly the same from one week to the next, hovering in the low- to mid-40s.Nearly three-quarters of Americans, meanwhile, said their life has been disrupted by the virus. Last week, only about one-quarter of respondents said the same. Within the last ten days, based on Centers for Disease Control advice about “social distancing,” a variety of sports leagues have canceled scheduled games, including the NBA and NCAA’s March Madness; colleges, universities, and K-12 schools have moved to online learning; churches across the country have ceased public services; and governors in a number of states have enacted emergency measures closing some non-essential stores or stopping non-essential travel to stem the spread of the virus.The ratings are divided largely, though not entirely, along partisan lines. A full 92 percent of Republicans said they approve of Trump’s performance; just 30 percent of Democrats said the same. There is also a partisan split in terms of how worried Americans are about the virus: 87 percent of Democrats say they are concerned about contracting COVID-19, while 66 percent of Republicans say the same. Independents poll similarly to Democrats on that question.The new poll found that 55 percent of respondents said they approve of the way the president is responding to the crisis, while 43 percent said they disapprove. This is an almost total reversal of last week’s numbers, when only 43 percent said they approved of the way Trump was handling the situation, and 54 percent disapproved.According to a National ReviewFollow Us",0,Poll: Majority Approves of Trump’s Handling of Coronavirus Pandemic

"Yesterday, Italy’s death toll surpassed that of China. The devastation in Italy has been attributed to its large portion of elderly citizens and its slow response to the crisis. However, the growth rate of new cases has slowed slightly, which indicates that the death toll may level off in the coming weeks. 205 Americans have died from coronavirus, more than double the death toll in South Korea, which stemmed the outbreak early with robust testing and social distancing. In Iran, numerous government officials have contracted the illness, 12 of whom haveChina reported zero cases of domestic transmission for the third day in a row, with new cases coming from abroad. As many of you pointed out in the comments yesterday, China’s official numbers should be taken with a grain of salt, since the country’s leadership covered up the initial outbreak and has a history of misreporting data. Still, there’s broad consensus that China has contained the virus domestically. In Italy and Iran, cases continue to mount, but in recent days we’ve seen signs of the growth rate slowing. We’ll be watching the U.K. closely, as Downing Street initially took an unorthodox approach to the outbreak, hoping to build “herd immunity” in the country. The U.K. has since been on lockdown, and reported more than 500 new cases yesterday, bringing the total to over 3,000.Last night, California governor Gavin Newsom issued a statewide “stay at home” After a slow rollout of coronavirus testing, the U.S. has ramped up its testing capacity, performing over 27,000 tests on March 19.

In the 2016 Brexit referendum, 64 percent of Brits over the age of 65 voted Leave, compared with only 29 percent of those under the age of 25. The same disparity was seen in Conservative voters in the 2017 and 2019 general elections. This global pandemic may not kill as many millennials as it kills boomers. But there’s a real possibility that it will destroy our already-diminished economic inheritance. And if that happens, another danger looms: Opportunistic socialists will have a chance to make their case to a resentful generation that has neither the personal memory nor the grasp of history necessary to resist their advances.
This is why so many Millennials are drawn to the ideas of those such as the French economist Thomas Piketty, who rejects “propertarianism” and would “democratize” the economy by nationalizing key industries and banishing the market from many spheres where it currently holds sway. They like ideas such as universal basic income and a wealth tax of up to 90 percent. In Spain, they support Podemos; in Greece, Syriza; in Britain, Jeremy Corbyn; and in America, Bernie Sanders. In the 2016 primaries, more young people voted for Sanders than for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump combined. According to one poll, 51 percent of Americans aged 18–29 have a positive view of socialism.But Millennials have had a different experience. The Berlin Wall came down before they knew what it was. They witnessed 9/11 and the Iraq War through innocent eyes. Then came the 2008 financial crash. Now they’re the generation that doesn’t own, but rents; holds down jobs, not careers; and pays offs student loans, not mortgages. They even appear to have lost some interest in sex and marriage. The idea that they will enjoy a greater quality of life than their parents is laughable, but most of them are not laughing; they’re resentful. Intensifying their anger is a fear that previous generations have also managed to ruin the planet, saddling them with the supposedly catastrophic effects of climate change.Boomers are often accused of having had it easy. As children, their neighborhoods were safe; as adults, their houses were affordable. Sure, they had some struggles: keeping jobs, paying mortgages, staying married, supporting us and their elderly parents for longer than they’d anticipated. Some of their children, now well into adulthood, have enjoyed similarly decent lives, growing up in the Cold War, when neoliberalism was still trendy and men still asked women out face-to-face.While the Wuhan coronavirus is a greater <span class=""drop"">A</span>

Rubio allows for $300 billion in aid to businesses. Dr. Hubbard and I calculate that the actual need will be in the range of $1.2 to $1.5 trillion.Rubio’s plan can be improved. The legislative language needs to allow grants to be spent on rent, and not just payroll.This kind of help for smaller businesses is desperately needed to prevent a collapse of key services, including restaurants, shops, cafes and hotels. Providing payroll grants is a critical step in keeping service workers in their jobs, and in stopping the economy from losing the skill, networks and specialized knowledge these businesses have built up.There is much to commend in Rubio’s bill. Notably, it would provide grants to eligible businesses to cover all payroll expenses incurred between March 1 and June 30. A full grant would only be available to businesses that did not lay off workers. The program uses commercial banks, which would allow small businesses to work with bankers they already know and trust. The bill also contains provisions to expedite the delivery of capital to businesses.A crucial part is a plan by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida for government grants and loans of up to $10 million to eligible small- and mid-sized businesses, conditional on those businesses retaining their employees during the crisis.The Senate is trying to design an economic recovery package. Senator Marco Rubio’s plan is critical. I discuss it in It’s hard to forecast right now, given so much uncertainty about the virus and the nation’s response to it. But the thrust is correct: Workers and businesses are in great peril — in much greater peril than was thought as recently as last Friday.To help understand the scale of what happens when you close down shops, restaurants, hotels, and the like, consider today’s updated GDP forecasts from Goldman Sachs. Their economists are now forecasting that the economy will shrink by 6 percent in the current quarter, and Our economic situation changed dramatically over the weekend when several of the nation’s mayors and governors effectively shut down the services sector of their economies in an effort to fight the spread of the coronavirus.

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>When I first went out to buy extra goods, such as rice and potatoes, for the long haul, it was like entering a new era. I didn’t know what we’d need in two weeks. Today, I feel most sorry for my children, suddenly out of school and away from friends, living in a bubble at home that feels more like an isolated space station than part of a wider society for them. This virus and the suggested “social distancing” makes one more wary of strangers, wary of taking the kids to the playground, for instance. This leads to a public that is more irritable and paranoid over time. Media reporting daily death tolls adds to insecurity. Unfortunately, the bad news has only just begun. The models predict that we will see rising cases and death tolls through the summer, if not in our own community, then in others. My advice: Take it one day at a time, don’t be afraid to ask for help, and give support and find innovative ways to connect, such as online chats with friends and family. And, as gyms and parks may close, get some exercise. It’s important for peace of mind.The economic impact of this crisis is likely going to be much larger than anticipated. It will start by hurting some industries and then spread to others. It’s important to account for this second economic curve that also needs to be flattened. In Israel, after just two weeks of increasing restrictions, there were already Policymakers and media tend to want to see faster results than the study calls for, speaking of The U.S.,As someone who has now gone through a quarantine and a lockdown, I have learned a few lessons so far. First, you don’t need much extra toilet paper. Commodities will still exist, but it’s worth to stock up on snacks and also things to do at home, especially if you have kids. That can mean more LEGO or free weights or puzzles. People need variations of things to do, and they need aspects of their daily routine to remain the same. Resist the temptation to sleep in and become lethargic. If you like coffee, stock up on that instead of the toiletries.Israel has taken increasingly strict precautions against the rising coronavirus pandemic. With the government having banned travelers from affected countries, quarantined everyone returning, and now locking down the country, we in Jerusalem are experiencing what much of U.S. and the world will soon experience.Today, I stepped gingerly into the damp air with my son for the first time in a week. For days, we hadn’t gone to a playground due to the coronavirus lockdown and warnings in my city. The quiet of the usually humming urban neighborhood was gone, replaced by chirping birds and a stray cat sitting on the sidewalk.

It will ultimately be in the hands of private-sector pharmaceutical companies to produce the therapeutics and vaccines needed to overcome this pandemic, and they’ll need all the deregulatory assistance they can get.There are still regulatory roadblocks to producing respirator masks. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has told those working on For an example of the many nonsensical, uneven regulations and other roadblocks that prevent an efficient private-market response to the crisis, consider that manufacturers that provide respirator masks that can be used in public-health emergencies are not protected from liability risk. Typically, under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, the government assumes the cost of liability claims when it asks companies to provide products, but respirator masks historically have not been included. Their omission from liability protection would likely discourage manufacturers from producing enough masks for nurses and doctors in the ongoing coronavirus response. The Thanks to the Trump administration, there is now an ongoing deregulatory effort to allow physicians to work across state lines. As of now, the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker has 
Similarly, state occupational-licensing rules stand in the way of allowing licensed professionals to help in the crisis. According to estimates by economists Morris Kleiner and Alan Krueger, approximately 30 percent of all U.S. jobs (an asymmetric proportion of which are deeply involved in the COVID-19 fight) require a license, up from around 5 percent in the 1950s. Ideally, to address physician shortages and further assist those in need, a relaxation of occupational-licensing laws should extend to physicians, echoing measures that Milton Friedman argued for long ago, in Last Friday, after the president’s declaration of a national emergency, the Department of Transportation announced Amid grocery-store shortages during the coronavirus pandemic, it’s up to truckers to get items to affected areas quickly and efficiently so that shelves can be restocked and demand met.For instance, since 1938, federal regulations limit most commercial truck drivers to eleven hours of driving time in a 14-hour workday. The restriction is intended to reduce accidents caused by highway fatigue. The rule doesn’t necessarily encourage safety, however, as truckers may be forced off the road at the end of their workday in areas not hospitable to truckers.Several regulatory practices impede a quick and urgent response to the COVID-19 outbreak.<span class=""drop"">A</span>

The chart below shows that Washington has done a much better job of controlling its outbreak than New York and California, with the caveat that the outbreak in Seattle preceded those in other states, so Washington is at a later stage in its response. We’ll be looking closely at California, which has carried out many fewer tests per capita than other states. While the California and New York clusters appear similar, we suspect that further testing will show California to be experiencing a more severe outbreak.Likely due to that increase in testing, including drive-through testing in certain areas, New York Due to the variance in testing between states, it’s hard to directly compare the severity of the three large domestic outbreaks. Washington has administered more than 20,000 tests per one million residents, compared with roughly 2,400 per million in California. As a result, there are likely many more cases in California than have been confirmed. New York, while lagging Washington, has ramped up testing in recent days, carrying out nearly 8,000 tests yesterday alone.There are now three coronavirus clusters in the U.S.: New York, California, and Washington. As of Friday afternoon, more than 7,000 New Yorkers had tested positive for the virus, while California and Washington continued to hover in the low to mid thousands.

But the sad thing is I’m afraid today, for now, at least physically, we need to keep people apart,” Johnson said.The order will also apply to nightclubs, theaters, cinemas, gyms, and leisure centers.“Following agreement between all the formations of the United Kingdom, all the involved administrations, we are collectively telling cafes, pubs, bars, and restaurants to close tonight as soon as they reasonably can and not to open tomorrow.

No charge.Brian Snyder/ReutersNurse Teresa Malijon waits for patients at a drive-through testing site for COVID-19 coronavirus in a parking lot at the University of Washington's Northwest Outpatient Medical Center in Seattle, Wash., March 17, 2020.     AdvertisementAs I write, we simply do not know how the COVID-19 pandemic will play out in the U.S. When the dust settles, it may appear that this was an enormous overreaction, or that the measures taken were entirely appropriate, and perhaps even inadequate. I lean toward the former. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that policymakers have to make decisions with incomplete information. Regardless of how it turns out, the COVID-19 experience will hopefully focus peoples’ attention on the commonsense measures they can take in future years to lessen the impact of seasonal flu — and focus public attention on the need to be prepared for future pandemics.And could sending healthy young college students, who are more resistant to COVID-19 infection and suffer less-severe disease if they are infected, back to their homes, where they are more likely to infect older family members with underlying medical conditions, prove to have been the wrong decision? (Given that influenza appears to be more severe among young adults this year than usual, perhaps not.)Clearly, earlier availability of widespread, rapid testing would have allowed the identification of cases so that isolation measures could be more targeted. Despite this failure, it is possible that ingenious measures, less extreme than those currently being imposed, could have been devised to accomplish most of the public-health benefits with less economic and social cost. Could airlines have developed rapid screening procedures to discern infected passengers at less cost than canceling most of their flights and flying empty on the remaining ones? Could theaters, concert venues, and places of worship have stayed open at lower capacity by cleaning their interiors before each opening, screening attendees, and spacing them farther apart? Could restaurants have been allowed to stay open at reduced capacity to preserve jobs? Could older, more medically vulnerable members of the population, along with people who are already sick, be counted on to self-quarantine by staying home, especially if provisions were made to supply them with food and medicine? Could schools have closed for briefer periods so they could reassess the situation after a few weeks instead of closing for entire semesters and quarters? We may never know.Fear and anxiety may also be impairing our judgment. Our leaders may take more-extreme measures than the circumstances warrant. Healthy younger people can’t be bothered to wash hands, forgo handshakes, stay home if they are sick, and get the influenza vaccine during the flu season. But now they hoard, and avoid going outside even though their objective risk of contracting COVID-19 and having a bad outcome is extremely small.Humans are also risk-averse. As Nobel-prize winner Daniel Kahneman and other behavioral economists and psychologists have pointed out, loss aversion is one of the most powerful behavioral motivators people have. No public official, especially in an election year, wants to be accused of doing too little. No business owner, educator, or religious leader wants to be blamed for not being concerned enough about the welfare of their customers, students, or parishioners. Moreover, as Kahneman points out, we tend to overweight terrible but low-probability outcomes like a full-blown infectious-disease pandemic without comparing it with the bad, but less terrible, certain outcome that we face every year with the seasonal flu.What can explain the disparate responses to COVID-19 and influenza? Fear of the unknown is certainly at play. Flu is familiar; coronavirus is not.Remarkably, our society does not adhere to the basic public-health measures now being used for COVID-19 when dealing with the annual seasonal flu. Few people take care to wash their hands more frequently during flu season, even though this has been demonstrated to limit viral transmission. People grudgingly acknowledge that handshakes can spread disease, but continue to shake hands in flu season. Society does little to make it socially acceptable and economically feasible to stay home from work if you are sick with the flu. Most tellingly, despite the existence of an influenza vaccine that is known to decrease the chance of contracting the flu after exposure to the influenza virus and to decrease the severity of the disease if one does get sick, less than half the population gets vaccinated.Directives to maintain social distance and to isolate if infected or exposed to someone sick violate the basic human instinct to affiliate, an instinct that becomes more insistent in times of crisis. Such measures threaten to heighten anxiety in this time of uncertainty, especially among older adults and people with disabilities, many of whom already struggle with social isolation. After 9/11, the nation came together in rallies and concerts. Now American are instructed to set themselves apart.Important social interactions will also be lost as houses of worship, schools, and bowling leagues close and cancel regular events. As Robert Putnam and Charles Murray have documented, these organizations provide the social fabric that supports our democratic society. The Internet makes social distancing possible while carrying on a semblance of normalcy, but it is only a semblance. Taking classes remotely over the Internet is a sterile substitute for a full undergraduate experience that includes face-to-face interactions in and outside the classroom.The large-scale social-distancing and isolation measures being taken to combat COVID-19 — closing schools, banning large gatherings, nearly worldwide travel limitations, and, in many cities, closing restaurants and cafes — are intended to stop transmission of the virus and the spread of illness. However, they are blunt measures that are already having enormous economic and social consequences. Cancellation of sports seasons and tournaments will put everyone who works in concessions, cleaning, and maintenance at sports venues out of work. The same is true for the surrounding businesses that sell souvenirs and meals to fans. Closed theaters and concerts present the same issue. In New York City, closing the Broadway theaters for four weeks will cost an estimated $100 million in lost ticket revenues. And that does not factor in the losses to the surrounding restaurants and businesses. Canceling the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas, will have an estimated $356 million economic impact. When things return to normal, workers in large businesses will probably have jobs to go back to. But that will not be the case for workers at the surrounding restaurants and establishments that go out of business.The early imposition of travel bans in this country likely did much to limit the initial spread of disease. The approval of rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 that are increasingly available at thousands of public and private labs and through retail outlets such as Walmart, Target, and CVS will facilitate the identification and isolation of those who are infected. Targeting these people while encouraging those who are most vulnerable to COVID-19 — the elderly and those with underlying medical problems — to take proper precautions should interrupt the train of transmission, curtail the spread of the virus, and lower the number of deaths. But the authorities are doing much more. Perhaps too much more.The fatality rates in COVID-19 may prove to be far lower than the highest rates seen in historical influenza pandemics. We know that COVID-19 seems to spare younger persons and, like the seasonal flu, targets the elderly and those with underlying medical problems. In contrast, the worst of the influenza pandemics, the so-called Spanish Flu in 1918, with a reported case fatality rate of 2.5 percent in the U.S., had a uniquely high propensity to kill healthy young adults and was relatively less fatal for older patients. In addition, projections based on historical data come from pandemics that mostly occurred before modern drugs (e.g., antibiotics to treat often lethal secondary bacterial infections) and critical care were available. Death rates should be lower now, especially in countries with advanced medical systems. Finally, there is preliminary information that treatments for this new pandemic may be available. Chloroquine, an old, relatively safe, and cheap drug primarily used for treating malaria, is being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis. Some existing antiviral drugs, most notably the as yet unapproved remdesivir, are being evaluated in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment.Some epidemiologists are concerned that, since COVID-19 is caused by a new virus that our immune systems have not encountered before, it will look like a severe pandemic influenza with widespread transmission of the virus, serious illness, and a high number of deaths. Yet it does not appear to have taken that course in China or South Korea. To be sure, both countries applied aggressive containment and mitigation strategies. But it is doubtful — especially in China, where the government delayed acknowledging the disease and starting public-health interventions — that these strategies alone would have led to such a rapid peak and decline in new cases. Unless these countries experience a “second wave” of infections, the total numbers of cases and deaths seem low for countries of 1.4 billion and 51 million respectively.Over the past 100 years, there have been four years (1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009) when new influenza viruses with more-significant genetic changes emerged. People had little or no immunologic protection against these new viruses, which therefore spread efficiently from person to person and caused influenza pandemics with higher rates of illness, hospitalizations, and deaths than seasonal influenza does. In a recent paper, the Council of Economic Advisors estimated, from historical pandemic data, that in the most severe pandemic scenario, where a highly contagious virus causes a severe level of illness, more than 500,000 Americans could die.
In the current flu season, which has a month or more to run, the CDC estimates that 36 to 51 million Americans have become ill, with 360,000 to 670,000 hospitalized, and 22,000 to 55,000 deaths. As in previous years, the rate of hospitalization and death is highest among adults over 65. But this influenza season is uncharacteristically severe for younger age groups. Hospitalization rates for children 0–4 and adults 18–49 are the highest the CDC has on record in those age groups. Hospitalization rates for school-age children are the  To put COVID-19 in proper context, it is worth considering another respiratory virus, influenza, that causes the annual, seasonal flu epidemic to which Dr. Fauci referred. Small changes in the genetic makeup of circulating influenza viruses from year to year make the viruses less recognizable to humans’ immune systems and result in illness. In a typical flu season, 27 million Americans will get sick, 59,000 will die, and another 368,000 will be hospitalized but recover. What is known is that COVID-19 is much less lethal than Ebola (50 percent average case–fatality rate over multiple outbreaks) or the two other deadly coronavirus diseases SARS (10 percent) and MERS (36 percent) that made the jump from animals to humans, in 2002 and 2012, respectively. Most COVID-19 cases are mild or even asymptomatic. Nearly all the severe cases and deaths have happened among either elderly people or people who have underlying medical conditions such as lung and heart disease or diabetes. Unlike the case with other respiratory viruses, clinical attack rates — the percentage of people exposed to the virus who will become ill — are low among individuals under 19 years old; if they fall ill, the disease is almost always (97.3 percent of cases) mild.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, wrote that because of the high number of unreported cases, “the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1% . . . ultimately more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%).” (This is from Fauci, Lane, and Redfield, “Covid-19 — Navigating the Uncharted,” While early estimates of the COVID-19 fatality rate were quite high, a recent Chinese report put the fatality rate at 1.4 percent of hospitalized patients. These are more severely ill than the general patient who is not sick enough to be hospitalized or even need medical attention, so the number for all patients should be lower. The latest fatality estimate from South Korea is 0.9 percent. But this too is likely to fall as the outbreak evolves and a more accurate account of Korean cases is obtained. That is the usual pattern in epidemic infections. In the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza outbreak, for instance, the initial case–fatality estimate was 1 percent. As time passed and we obtained a more accurate case count, the U.S. rate How scared should we be of COVID-19? The answer depends on determining how many people are actually infected and what the case fatality rate — the number of deaths from the disease divided by the number of diagnosed cases — is. The COVID-19 virus appears to be readily transmissible between people. But determining the number of cases is difficult because the typical COVID-19 symptoms — cough, fever, fatigue — are similar to other illnesses, such as the flu, that are prevalent this time of year. Moreover, 80 percent of cases have only mild to moderate symptoms and do not attract medical attention. Even in South Korea, which has the world’s most aggressive testing regime, only a small fraction of the population has undergone laboratory testing for the virus. Deaths from COVID-19 (the numerator) are far easier to count than cases (the denominator). If the number of cases in the denominator is too low, the case–fatality ratio will be too high.COVID-19 was first identified in China in December 2019. The number of cases in China rose rapidly toward 80,000 but, per Chinese-government figures, stabilized by the end of February. The number of new cases began to fall in response to draconian public-health measures, including aggressive identification and isolation of cases and their contacts, quarantines of large cities, and travel restrictions. A similar pattern unfolded in South Korea, which identified its first case on January 20, had an initial rapid rise in cases, and now, following an aggressive program of testing and isolating cases, has seen its number of new cases fall rapidly. Now Europe (especially Italy), Iran, and the U.S. are in the expansion phase. The first U.S. case, a 35-year-old man who had returned from China five days earlier, <span class=""drop"">L</span>

AdvertisementAgain, spikes in reported cases are disturbing, and the death count is heartbreaking. Let’s keep our eye, though, on the fatality rate.Clearly, we have to do what we can to minimize the incidence of COVID-19 infections: hygiene, social distancing, and heightened protections for especially vulnerable groups (the elderly and people with underlying medical problems). Nevertheless, there remains, as Dr. Fauci suggests, a good chance that the fatality rate could drop under 1 percent, once (a) testing is widely available and (b) more people with no symptoms or very mild cases inflate the “reported cases” category.There were some quirks over the ten days. The rate went as high as 2.6 percent on March 11 (307 new cases, eight deaths) and as low as 0.8  percent on March 12 (396 new cases, three deaths). But on the whole, and with the caveat that a ten-day stretch is too small a data set from which to draw confident conclusions, the daily rate roughly tracks the 1.5 percent fatality rate we have for total U.S. cases.Even as the number of newly reported cases spiked, from 290 on March 10 to 4,530 on March 19, the fatality rate hovered at slightly over 1 percent: The March 10 rate was 1.3 percent (4 deaths), and March 19 it was 1.2 percent (57 deaths). Obviously, it’s important to note that the daily deaths are not necessarily attributable to that day’s newly reported infection cases (in fact, they’re usually not).What I was most struck by was how consistent the U.S. fatality rate stayed during the most recent ten-day period.Our fatality rate is thus significantly lower than the global rate of 4.1 percent (10,080 out of 248,098). The U.S. number is comparable to South Korea’s 1.2 percent (100 deaths out of 8,652 cases). It is markedly better than Italy’s staggering 8.3 percent fatality rate (3,405 out of 41,035), the U.K.’s 4.4 percent (144 out of 3,269), and France’s 3.4 percent (372 out of 10,995). By contrast, we seem to be doing worse than Germany, which had lost 44 people out of 16,626 reported cases (a 0.3 percent fatality rate). I do not put much stock in the numbers out of China and Iran, whose regimes are not trustworthy. China is almost certainly lowballing at 4 percent (3,248 deaths out of 80,967 reported cases); Iran’s eye-popping 17.7 percent fatality rate (3,248 out of 18,407) is so astronomical, even compared to Italy, that I’m skeptical (though Iran is a troubled enough country that it could be reasonably accurate).The That seems like a sensible assumption. After all, testing has skewed toward people who feel sick enough to report. We must also recognize, as As Reporting those two stats in isolation makes them seem especially alarming. If, hypothetically, on Day One there were 100 cases, and on Day 5 there were 1,000 cases, that would be a very troubling rate of increase, though it could be mitigated by a number of factors. (For example, if testing has improved in the interim, the surge in reported cases could reflect better information about the overall phenomenon, rather than just a rapid spread of the disease.) Similarly, if there were ten deaths on Day 5 after only one on Day One, that jump would seem frightening . . . but it would be a proportional increase in fatalities given the tenfold jump in reported cases — I do not mean to suggest that this information is not out there. It just does not get the same attention as the total number of cases and the total number of deaths.Like many Americans, I’ve been tracking statistical reports about the coronavirus pandemic.

Yet Lehman writes:There’s something meaningful to the fact that no one in Congress is really arguing for the federal government to do nothing, which is not what most libertarians would be on board with now anyway. Instead, they’re arguing over the best way to increase government involvement. This is an extraordinary crisis. Government does often grow in such times in ways that linger afterward.

But it didn’t merely originate there. As Victor Davis Hanson has noted, China’s Communist Party rulers hid its outbreak from the rest of the world for several crucial weeks. They misrepresented its contagious nature for several more. They permitted thousands of Chinese nationals to travel throughout the world while obfuscating the potential consequences. And the Chinese government is falsely claiming the U.S. military is responsible for introducing the virus. Under those circumstances, to object to calling the virus “Chinese Coronavirus” is, to say the very least, profoundly misguided.It’s common to refer to infectious diseases by their geographic origin. Examples include Asian flu, Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, German measles, Japanese encephalitis, Lyme disease, Marburg virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Pontiac fever, Rift Valley fever, Spanish flu, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and West Nile virus. Spanish flu was probably a misnomer. It may have originated in Kansas. But calling it Spanish flu was never an indication that people hated Spaniards. Nor is there any evidence that the names of any of the other diseases inspired “racism or xenophobia” toward races or ethnicities commonly identified with such regions.Of course, my conservative colleague Gail Heriot and I oppose expressions of racism, if any, related to the pandemic or otherwise. But we voted against the statement for several reasons. Our biggest objection related to the Commission’s suggestion that referring to COVID-19 with terms like “Chinese Coronavirus or Wuhan flu” is somehow fueling “[t]his latest wave of xenophobic animosity toward Asian-Americans.” This suggestion is consistent with those recently voiced by Democrats and mainstream media (but I repeat myself).During today’s meeting of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, the liberal majority voted to issue a statement expressing “grave concern” regarding “growing anti-Asian racism and xenophobia” related to the coronavirus pandemic.National ReviewFollow Us",0,A Pandemic of Political Correctness

No charge.Politics, not law.No matter what happens, the law — i.e., the Trump administration’s conclusions about its DPA, Stafford Act, and constitutional authorities — will have little to say about it. The history of this country is one of ceding authority to the chief executive, to an extent commensurate with the public’s sense of real threat, particularly lethal threat on a mass scale. Later, Congress and the courts push back, but only once the perception of peril ebbs. They push back with law. Yet, the extent to which law is a real barrier to future presidential muscle-flexing, for good or ill, depends not on what the statutes and opinions say, but on how scared we are.Even with all that, and even if we can minimize the number infected and eventually reduce the fatality rate, it is entirely conceivable that thousands more people will die from COVID-19 than die from flu. But tragic as that outcome would be, it would pale in comparison to the ruin that looms if we do not resume a semblance of normal life.This is, and has to be, the pattern of political determinations: Err on the side of safety, but abate if, with the context of better information, living more realistically with the threat begins to appear less dire than the alternatives. Here, the coronavirus shutdown may have been an understandable first reaction, even a justifiable one. But it has to be weighed against the catastrophic consequences. And it has to factor in our improving understanding of the threats and the behaviors that mitigate it — hand washing, other rudimentary hygiene, social distancing, avoiding large crowds for now, extra safeguards for the elderly and people with preexisting health problems, and so on. If we do these things, many fewer people (especially vulnerable people) will be exposed.It is not sustainable for government to combat the disease by ordering communal and commercial activity to cease, then trying to compensate increasingly destitute citizens by borrowing and printing money to throw at them.That said, I think Heather’s main point is well taken. Her Our estimable <a href=""https://newcriterion.com/blogs/dispatch/compared-to-what"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Heather Mac Donald</a>We have to be mindful of this dynamic.  
   In the early 1950s, things seemed suddenly dire. Such emergency measures as the DPA and the seizure of the steel mills may have appeared reasonable. Over time, though, threats — or at least our comprehension of them — become clearer. Gradually, DPA powers were tapered back. By 1952, the Supreme Court was willing to strike down wartime executive actions as excessive, something the justices had been notoriously unwilling to do during World War II. The Korean War was serious, but it was not a potentially existential peril. It warranted significant deference to national-security needs; it did not warrant upending our fundamental conceits about economic liberty and the relationship between citizens (the sovereign) and the state (the servant).  
   In the aftermath of World War II, there was a massive downsizing of the armed forces and defense production — not just because the war ended but because our development of nuclear weapons fed an assumption that conventional military capabilities were no longer as essential. The Soviet tyranny in Eastern Europe, the Communist triumph in China’s civil war, and the Korean Conflict burst that assumption — just as, 40 years later, the rise of jihadist terrorism would explode the rose-tinted assumption that the Soviet collapse had ushered in a “peace dividend” of waning military power, of security assured by global legal processes.That last bit is a quote from the famous ruling in which the Supreme Court invalidated Truman’s seizure (Indeed, the Truman administration explicitly forswore reliance on the DPA in 1952, when the president directed his commerce secretary to seize and operate steel mills. A labor strike during the Korean War had halted production and threatened to leave the armed forces without vital supplies. The Justice Department relied mainly on what it posited was Truman’s constitutional authority, arguing that the DPA’s seizure provisions were “much too cumbersome, involved, and time-consuming for the crisis which was at hand.”Still, were he to do so, it would not be extraordinary. (At least the fact of such a directive’s issuance would not be unusual; the substance might be.) In DPA’s 70 years on the books, executive administrations have invoked it dozens of times. These have been fairly uncontroversial. For the most part, the act has simply facilitated the production of security-related goods and services through loan guarantees and the waiver of legal restrictions that otherwise inhibit private corporations.The DPA seems ominous from the perspective of a free-market society committed to the protection of property rights. Under it, private industry may be mandated to accept and prioritize government orders and contracts to meet what the president unilaterally determines to be national-defense needs. As of this writing, Trump’s triggering of the DPA is mere exhortation. He is encouraging private corporations to produce the medical testing and treatment components that are urgently needed; but so far, he has not presumed to order them to do anything.Meanwhile, on Wednesday the president invoked the The president has floated the notion of triggering the act’s more potent declaration of a “major disaster.” Legally, that seems unlikely: The Stafford Act says such a declaration must be requested by the affected state(s), and its terms are confined to physical infrastructure damaged by natural catastrophes (e.g., hurricanes and earthquakes), not by pathogens that infect people but do not destroy structures. Yet, if states hard hit by COVID-19 were to make the request, and the president responded with additional tranches of federal assistance, how punctilious do we really think Americans would be about statutory construction?
Of course, the books overflow with laws. Last weekend, for example, President Trump issued a formal emergency declaration under the 1988 Stafford Act (formally, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act). It endows the president with unilateral powers to support states and localities when their capacities are overwhelmed by a catastrophe affecting public health or safety — including by making federal emergency relief funds (currently, about $50 billion) available.The law also works best when we are confident we know enough about a topic to regulate for all future conditions. The law works well for bank transactions, and especially for bank robbery. For infectious-disease outbreaks . . . maybe not so much.We could bat these questions around for some time. The bottom line, however, is that there are probably no settled legal answers. We miss that in normal times of peace and prosperity, when the rule of law governs. But in crisis, we see the limits of law. In essence, these questions call for The county’s move raises all sorts of constitutional questions about federalism. At what level of government do we properly resolve such questions — federal, state, county, municipal? Do Americans have a settled right of travel — intrastate, interstate, international — that applies at all times, or is the law flexible in this regard (as it can be regarding the imposition of martial law in times of war, invasion, and insurrection)?

After all, despair, as Bill Buckley always taught and cautioned, is a sin.It is tough to embrace this, all while knowing that worse things are to come, for the Nazarean — still to be hung on the cross — and maybe for our society, as we await some medical peak, as we risk economic mayhem. But then comes this too: the spiritual assurance that things much better will follow. Even the guy next to him on the cross got a ticket to Paradise.<em>Who would believe what we have heard? To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? He grew up like a sapling before him, like a shoot from the parched earth; there was in him no stately bearing to make us look at him, no appearance that would attract us to him. He was rejected and avoided by men, a man of suffering accustomed to infirmity, one of those from whom men turned away, and we held him in no esteem.</em>Maybe it is fitting that the anxieties that have so grabbed and shaken our country and world come at this season of Lent, when prayerful thoughts of suffering receive greater attention for many. We papists have a Friday-night seasonal tradition of the Stations of the Cross, and the loneliness of the Second Station, in which Jesus is forced to carry His cross, is made vivid in the prayer of the congregation, who repeat verses from Isaiah 53:<strong><em>A Dios</em></strong>Between the former Robins teammates’ alpha and omega — Carey’s 1910 debut and Bobo’s 1953 sayonara — were 43 years of baseball’s golden era.

Walmart’s move is the latest sign of how “preferred pronouns” have taken root the United States, Canada, Britain, and some non-English speaking countries. In France, for example, some people are proposing using “iel” or “ille” ‒ a combination of the masculine “il” and the feminine “elle,” to refer to non-binary people. In the United States, it’s becoming normal practice for schools and colleges, hospitals, media, and government and corporate offices to use the singular “they” or other recently coined pronouns.The gender identity movement has spread from elite bastions of higher learning such as Harvard and Wesleyan to the Walmart nearest you.

In a strictly online environment, socialization would be fractured – the friendships students gain would vanish, as would all the memories of parties, all-night study sessions, and dorm life.College affordability and student debt are two of the most pressing issues to young Americans today – they would no doubt look favorably at any arrangement that allows them a way to finish a college degree without significantly hamstringing their economic futures.Once a large university proves it can provide a reasonable facsimile of its course offerings without the enormous expense, students may start to demand they do so.But when large universities shift their course offerings online during a global pandemic, it might get students wondering – why would they continue to pay exorbitant fees for dorms, meal plans, and parking, when they can get the same instruction sitting at home in front of their computers?Of course, “distance learning” is nothing new. According to 6. At On this alone, you’d think that Die Linke would have distanced itself from the East German dictatorship. That is not the case.The East German regime was equally known for its discrimination against the LGBT community. Homosexuality was considered a result of “the decadence of the bourgeoisie” and became a target of the regime. One 1990s study commissioned by the Berlin Senate found that the East German Ministry of State for Security (MfS) used the so-called However, Die Linke’s legitimization is a strange and historic occurrence in Germany. The party is the successor to the East German communist party SED, which tortured political opponents and bankrupted the country. Over 200 East German refugees were killed by border guards in efforts to get to the West.A few weeks ago, the German liberal democrats (FDP) took a lot of flack for accepting a local state presidency election win in Thüringen, which was made possible through the votes of the far-right “AFD Alternative für Deutschland” (Alternative for Germany). Germany remains a political barometer for Europe. Following the happenings in Berlin and the 16 German state governments can give you a good idea of where the continent will be heading. During the sovereign debt crisis, German criticism of the euro as a common currency opened the floodgates for mainstream opposition (that ultimately did not substantiate).

Let me rephrase that: People in the entertainment business aren’t stupid Hollywood still operates on what we might call the Leni Riefenstahl model: If you want to project power, better be prepared to put on a show. From the icy and theatrical lobbies of the major talent agencies to the endless series of Long Marches down the awards-show red carpet, the various power centers of the entertainment business spend considerable time and money marshaling crowds. Oscar hopefuls throw lavish dinners and parties to woo Academy voters. Television networks stage theatrical extravaganzas—the “Upfronts”—every spring to introduce advertisers to their fall season premieres. Movie premieres still require worldwide press junkets—flights to Paris and Rome and Singapore and Dubai—each with a party and paparazzi and deluxe gift bags for the press. There are still major film markets at Cannes and Berlin and Toronto. Amazon and Netflix—two enterprises you’d assume would be immune to this kind of excess—are enthusiastic and visible presences at film festivals like TriBeCa and Sundance.3. At By comparison, there were 38,800 traffic fatalities in the United States in 2019, the National Safety Council estimates. That represents an average of over one hundred traffic deaths every day; if the press catalogued these in as much painstaking detail as they have deaths from coronavirus, highways nationwide would be as empty as New York subways are now. Even assuming that coronavirus deaths in the United States increase by a factor of one thousand over the year, the resulting deaths would only outnumber annual traffic deaths by 2,200. Shutting down highways would have a much more positive effect on the U.S. mortality rate than shutting down the U.S. economy to try to prevent the spread of the virus.Much has been made of the “exponential” rate of infection in European and Asian countries—as if the spread of all transmittable diseases did not develop along geometric, as opposed to arithmetic, growth patterns. What actually matters is whether or not the growing “pandemic” overwhelms our ability to ensure the well-being of U.S. residents with efficiency and precision. But fear of the disease, and not the disease itself, has already spoiled that for us. Even if my odds of dying from coronavirus should suddenly jump ten-thousand-fold, from the current rate of .000012 percent across the U.S. population all the way up to .12 percent, I’d happily take those odds over the destruction being wrought on the U.S. and global economy from this unbridled panic.Compared to what? That should be the question that every fear-mongering news story on the coronavirus has to start with. So far, the United States has seen forty-one deaths from the infection. Twenty-two of those deaths occurred in one poorly run nursing home outside of Seattle, the Life Care Center. Another nine deaths occurred in the rest of Washington state, leaving ten deaths (four in California, two in Florida, and one in each of Georgia, Kansas, New Jersey, and South Dakota) spread throughout the rest of the approximately 329 million residents of the United States. This represents roughly .000012 percent of the U.S. population.2. At It’s easy to criticize decisions, speeches, news conferences, or commentaries of our policymakers. Mistakes abound and are evident; wise choices are rarely recognized and appreciated. But every tough decision made about the pandemic hinges on finding some perfect, but largely unknown, mean to limit impoverishment, illness, and death. We have relatively recent examples both of failures of doing too much and of too little.If the country goes into a serious recession or even depression; if trillions of dollars more of investment and liquidity continue to be wiped out while businesses crash and jobs are lost; if millions of unemployed cut back on their scheduled health care; if they increase their use of drugs, alcohol, or tobacco, and get less exercise and suffer depression holed up in their homes or must borrow or scramble to find daycare for their school-age children; if they even contemplate suicide—then the human toll spikes in concrete terms of life and death. In the long term, arming ourselves against the virus could be as serious as the virus itself, though to suggest that in these dark days of plague is heresy.With new draconian measures of containment, we are entering the realm of cost-benefit analyses, given that for every drastic action there is an equally radical reaction—calibrated by everything from physical and mental health issues to economic, financial, security, legal, and political upheavals. Whether we like it or not, the current sweeping measures to curb the virus come at a huge cost—and the tab isn’t just financial or economic, as is sometimes alleged, by both advocates and critics of quarantines, cancellations, and radical social distancing. It involves health issues as well.1. At <strong>The Six</strong>8. At 7. Scot “Ernieand” Bertram and Jeff “Y-Pop” Blehar discuss The Pogues with Alfred Schulz on the new episode of 6. Meanwhile at 5. On the new episode of 4. On Episode 7 of 3. On the new 2. On the new episode of 1. On the new episode of <strong><em>Podcastapalooza</em></strong>As Levin and Ponnuru see it, the Trump presidency has posed two problems for the wonks and intellectuals of the Right. The first is practical and personal: The thinkers of the Right, including the reformocons themselves, are divided between those inexorably opposed to cooperating with the president and those who view Trump’s term as an opportunity that must be seized. This divide has fractured movements and friendships. But Levin and Ponnuru’s second point is more subtle. “Because Trumpism has for the most part not been embodied in particular policy proposals,” they write, “different factions on the right have tried to claim its power for their own and to insist that Trump’s success in 2016 is proof of principle for a new direction.” But the Trump’s administration’s inability to enact or even endorse a coherent policy platform means that these debates over the “new direction” of conservatism can never end. “Lacking both the responsibility to enact and implement policy and the burden of resisting an assertive progressivism in Washington, the Right’s policy thinking has been short on discipline and mooring.” Policymaking has been replaced by posturing. This is a death knell for a movement as wonkish and policy-focused as reform conservatism. Implied here is that if a more competent, policy-savvy administration had been elected or a Democratic administration threatened the nation with policies of their own, then the reformocons would still be around and the intellectual civil war that now pits one bitter conservative against another would have ceased long ago.The reformocons are not among the warring tribes. This is odd. This In the year 2020, debates over ideas matter more to the Right than they have for decades. At first glance this seems a silly thing to say. The sitting president has all the intellectual coherence of a rock. But that rock crashed through Washington, opening up holes in the conservative coalition that conservatives long pretended did not exist. Now a half-dozen factions war among the ruins, desperately trying to stake their claim to define the ways and means of the future American Right.This in turn prompted an — well, if you will — This spawned a symposium, in which Matt Continetti, Daniel McCarthy, Robert VerBruggen, and Luke Thompson reflect on the essay. This lack of disciplining pressures has been particularly evident as a loss of interest in coalition-building among conservatives. The Right’s internal arguments have naturally come to be focused, as they often have been over the past half century, on a conflict between libertarian economic thought and conservative social thought. Recurring (and unavoidable) tensions between the two have shaped the story of American conservatism since the middle of the last century. But the Right has tended to succeed when it has treated those tensions as an impetus for balance and for concrete policy innovation and has tended to fail when it has let them become a source of polarizing discord and blinding abstraction.This inaction on policy may actually help explain some of the intellectual ferment. In some respects, the Right’s internal debates have felt like those that might happen when Republicans are out of power: Nothing seems plausibly achievable in the near term, so policy entrepreneurs try to formulate what they would do in the future if they could. Yet these scenarios are getting debated without the living specter of a Democratic president exercising the powers of the executive, so the Right’s arguments lack the humility that comes with losing and the caution that comes with a vivid sense of the harm that government power can do in the wrong hands. Lacking both the responsibility to enact and implement policy and the burden of resisting an assertive progressivism in Washington, the Right’s policy thinking has been short on discipline and mooring, and the relationship between theory and practice has become confused.It may seem counterintuitive, given how intense and action-packed the last few years have felt to political junkies, but if the Trump era ends next year, it will have changed next to nothing in domestic policy. Its lasting accomplishments would then mainly be the indirect consequences of Trump’s judicial appointments—important, to be sure, but hardly on the scale of what a party in power in both elected branches might expect.In the previous issue of <strong>Reform School</strong>You wonder if the people in the CDC saw those movies and thought, We got that stuff? We have that power? Cool! No worries, mon. Then the bleep impacts the fan.The fourth lesson: Maaaaybe the CDC could have put on a better show in the early stages of the outbreak? We’ve all seen movies about pandemics. Someone smart and attractive gets a phone call, and they promptly type something into a computer while looking concerned. Next scene, helicopters are airborne. Next scene, our hero scientist is showing a PowerPoint to some people, and then everyone leaves the room to order more helicopters and get the National Guard to seal off a small town.The third lesson: Maaaaybe it was a bad idea to let China make everything? Just a thought.The second lesson is that no one, in a pinch, wants the all-natural cleaning ingredients. At the store all the stuff with BLEACH is gone. The products that promise THE SLAUGHTER POWER OF CHLORINE are gone. The all-natural stuff that promises to use lavender oils to disinfect your countertops and hands? No one wants it. That was all a pose. The extra-special-virtue keister-cleaner from recycled paper was the last to sell out. Push comes to grunt, people will buy toilet paper made from old-growth redwoods.5. In his always wonderful “Athwart” column, James Lileks shares some epidemic lessons and observations. Until that improves, the response we mount will not be as well organized or clearly articulated as it could be. But we can be grateful that in our society not everything has to be coordinated from above. And we can be grateful for the countless men and women, in every corner of our country and in every facet of its life, who are rising to this grave and sudden challenge with compassion, creativity, and courage.We are still very much in the thick of this crisis, and real perspective on our government’s performance is impossible. But at this stage, at least, it seems that many key officials are doing many important things right yet also that they have to work around some serious decisional dysfunction at the top. That, more than any particular misjudgment and more than the sheer fact of disruption in our lives, is what appears to require attention, criticism, and correction.We have seen some of this around the early steps toward “social distancing” in different places. It may be odd to suggest that aggressively shutting things down is an example of our prowess for mobilization. But given our way of life, the willingness and the ability to radically constrain our activities and choices is actually a show of strength. In a free society, austerity is a form of mobilization. And it has taken shape largely from the bottom up, in school districts, in the business world, and then increasingly with prods from state and local leaders. The president largely resisted the trend at first, and as late as mid March had still not spoken in ways that might prepare the country for what’s coming and thereby explain the drastic measures being taken everywhere. But those measures have come regardless. And in similar ways, resources up and down our government and across our society may be deployed to help the health system gird itself a little better for the awful effort to come.Our system really is good at mobilizing in a crisis and learning quickly how to manage unfamiliar terrain. But learning to manage a crisis without the full participation of the White House will call upon some muscles that have not been stretched in quite some time.4. Yuval Levin scores Washington’s response to the epidemic, and finds that leadership does not only emanate from above. COVID-19 is devilish because so many of those who contract it are without symptoms, or with symptoms that are indistinguishable from the common cold. These days, in Seattle, Los Angeles, and New York, if you have a cough or a low-grade fever but no access to a test, you have no idea whether your actions are putting others in danger. You cannot know whether delivering canned goods to elderly neighbors is saving them some trouble or exposing them to fatal danger.The fear and lawless extravagance are two understandable reactions to the un known. A state of ignorance liberates some and confines others. A widespread test for the virus would put an end to both simultaneously. We instinctively know that both responses are wrong. One threatens public health, and the other threatens the functioning of the economy.It is easy to get angry with the revelers, who may have spread the disease unknowingly. But it will prove impossible to hold them to account. With widespread testing, South Korea has identified a single member of a church as creating three separate clusters of the disease in that country. This poor woman, if identified by name, will bear a heavy cost for life. Wide spread testing allowed normal life to return to Singapore and will soon allow normal life to return to South Korea, because it restores the senses of accountability and fairness that are necessary in a law-governed society.As schools and offices eventually shut and rumors of forthcoming “shelter in place” orders or a 3. As the Coronavirus reaction strengthens its societal chokehold, Michael Brendan Dougherty sees fear and revelry up close. Reverend Dean Nelson, executive director of the pro-life Human Coalition, tells me that the resolution is “historic and phenomenal.” Nelson is one of a number of African-American leaders who work with the National Black Pro-Life Coalition, a network of groups seeking to “restore life, family and hope in the Black community,” according to its website.“Abortion is genocide. Abortion must end to protect the life of the unborn. The Church of God in Christ opposes elective abortions,” the resolution reads. “This issue of personhood has haunted America since the In November, the Church of God in Christ unveiled its “Resolution on the Sanctity of Human Life.” It is the largest Pentecostal denomination in the United States, with more than 5 million members, overwhelmingly African-American and Democratic.2. Alexandra DeSanctis reveals that the pro-life movement consists of a strong African-American contingent. Nor have Democratic politicians acted with great farsightedness and altruism. As John McCormack observed in The comparison obscures more than it reveals. It is true that most Democratic politicians and strategists fear that nominating Sanders would throw away the party’s chance of winning the general election, just as Republicans feared about Trump in 2016. But many Republican officials nonetheless preferred Trump over his last real rival, Ted Cruz. The fear that nominating Trump would doom Republicans to defeat also proved incorrect: a point one would not think needs to be made, but the prevalence of this comparison suggests otherwise. Trump won the election, Republicans still have the Senate, and many Republican Party priorities, including reduced corporate tax rates and a more conservative judiciary, have been advanced as a result.The most common explanation from pundits for Biden’s rapid change of fortune paid tribute to the health of the Democratic Party. The Republican establishment, the story went, had been unable to beat back Donald Trump’s insurgency in 2016. While only a minority of Republican voters wanted him, several candidates stayed in the race and split the non-Trump vote. Democratic candidates this year, the story continues, acted in the interests of the party rather than in their narrow self-interest. After performing poorly in the South Carolina primary, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar promptly exited the race and endorsed Biden. Michael Bloomberg did the same a few days later, following the Super Tuesday primaries.1. Ramesh Ponnuru explains how Biden reemerged, and takes on comparisons to Donald Trump’s 2016 GOP bid. <strong>From the April 6, 2020, Issue of <em>National Review</em>, a Sampling of Five Exceptional Pieces</strong>And this is how Some form of social distancing was always perpetuated by the idea of escapism — entertainment that keeps reality, the troubles of the world, at arm’s length. Hollywood’s concentration on comic-book movies this millennium is irrefutable evidence of the tendency to seek distraction and relief from unpleasant realities through an emphasis on fantasy. This tendency even keeps art a remote idea for moviegoers bred on the disposable, meaningless trash that’s a preoccupation of the adolescent sensibility (thus, the basis of the wars between the Marvel and D.C. universes).This week’s home-video release of 15. “Social distancing” comes in for the Armond White treatment. He compares last year’s Signer, though, seems to feel differently.When a few hundred Nazis, in a nation of 350 million, get together and march down Main Street, that isn’t a particularly compelling reason to rethink our rights. In 1939, well after Hitler’s tyrannical intentions were known, 20,000 Nazi sympathizers filled up Madison Square Garden. There will always be extremists in America. Which is one reason why we must always do our best to safeguard natural rights.The first problem with Signer’s case is the premise itself. Sorry, but we have no uniquely pressing need to “keep pace” with violent or threatening “political disruptions.” Americans live in era of relatively little political violence. A person doesn’t even have to go back to the brutality of  the1860s and 1870s to understand this; they can just look back at the 1960s and 1970s, or maybe even the 1990s.Well, in a recent ‘Two things form the bedrock of any open society,” Salman Rushdie once noted, “freedom of expression and rule of law. If you don’t have those things, you don’t have a free country.”14. Free speech comes under attack by the former mayor of Charlottesville, the quite lefty/liberal Michael Signer. David Harsanyi calls out the stupidity. In recent years, defenders of the neoliberal order have taken to venting their anger at the political factions that have sprung up in response to neoliberal dislocations — “populists,” “nationalists,” Brexiteers, and, of course, Donald Trump. Yet these political actors have gained a foothold precisely because of the tensions that neoliberalism heightened: the economic frustrations of a financializing economy, the disruptions of mass migration, the polarization between the professional classes and blue-collar workers, and so forth.High neoliberalism already had a preexisting health condition, and this global pandemic may be fatal for it. World trade as a percentage of global GDP peaked in 2008, after which the financial crisis made it plummet. It has climbed closer to that historic high, but the coronavirus outbreak seems likely to send that number downward again. Harder borders are springing up around the world, with even free-movement havens such as the Schengen Area being divided. For the moment, at least, coronavirus has severely curtailed the free movement of goods and people that is at the heart of many neoliberal dreams.13. Fred Bauer considers how the Coronavirus epidemic could reshape American politics. The SPLC is most widely known for its list of “hate groups,” a list that captures ““‘The S.P.L.C.—making hate pay,’ we’d say,” Moser recalled. The SPLC has an endowment of roughly half a billion dollars, and millions in Allegations of Almost exactly one year ago, the Southern Poverty Law Center fired its co-founder and promised an 12. The corruption-enmeshed, wildly accusatory, Lefty-favorite Southern Poverty Law Center promised an internal review a year ago. Tyler O’Neil says it’s fake. I visited Rome twice in 2018, again for Church-related work. The spirit of the place today is different. Some of my unease doubtless comes from my own age, not the city’s. Skepticism can grow along with one’s years. But the change is too tangible to miss. There are days now when (Catholic) Rome, in the words of a longtime friend who lives there, really does feel like Constantinople must have felt in the last years of the Palaiologoi: a museum surrounded by the hostile and indifferent, curated by the mediocre and confused. The sense of endings is oppressive — a sclerosis of thought and small, crabbed personalities, made more painful by the memory of past excellence, and compounded by a coronavirus that has highlighted the “aging out” of the whole country. For the believer who looks too closely and reflects too long, Rome can be as much a worry as a refreshment. This isn’t new, in a sense. Martin Luther had the same reaction. That didn’t end well.I returned for Church-related work in 1985, ’87, ’89, ’97, ’99, 2001, ’14, and ’15, always with roughly the same mix of feelings. In all those visits, the living Catholic soul of the city — if one cared to look for it — redeemed the vulgarity and offered clean oxygen to inhale along with the narcotic scent of memory and ruins. Throughout the tenures of Karol Wojtyla and Joseph Ratzinger, but also well before that in the Pacelli, Roncalli, and Montini pontificates, serious pastoral concerns and serious intellect coincided. They reinforced each other. Exacting Catholic thought mattered; it wasn’t sufficient for faith, but it was seen and respected as necessary. It provided the fertile soil for Christian action. This seemed to continue, or at least not to be stymied, in the first years of the Bergoglio pontificate.11. Long-time Catholic warrior Fran Maier reflects on oft-visited Rome, and finds that under the reign of Pope Francis is has devolved into “a museum surrounded by the hostile and indifferent, curated by the mediocre and confused.” Speaking of dodgy, recall that Team Mueller and the Justice Department dodged every case that would have called for proving Russia’s cyber theft. Even when Let me repeat something else I said several times: This is not to say that Russia is innocent. Again, I accept the intelligence agencies’ conclusion on this point (though a number of others, As detailed here many times, one of the biggest problems confronting those weaving the collusion tale was the inability to prove that Russia hacked the Democratic email accounts. As 10. While you were distracted, writes Andy McCarthy, the DOJ has dismissed Team Mueller’s lame-o case against Russian businesses. Their claims to the contrary notwithstanding, it seems that the women’s team had a superior CBA to that of their male counterparts. The WNT played an average of 16 “friendlies,” or exhibition matches, each year from 2017 through 2019. In that same span, the men’s team played an average of eight friendlies. Both teams have complex revenue streams, which include variable items like endorsements, ticket sales, and merchandise. If we compare the reimbursement rates for friendlies, however, it allows us to compare like with like.The WNT’s CBA includes a guaranteed $100,000 base salary and pays players a discounted rate when they’re sick, injured, or pregnant. The MNT’s CBA includes no guaranteed salary but a higher “per game fee” than members of the WNT receive. These disparate arrangements are the natural result of volitional collective-bargaining processes between the federation and two teams with different material interests, risk tolerances, and — yes — potential revenues.But even if we were to suspend disbelief and pretend that men’s soccer and women’s soccer involve the same level of “skill,” it is not clear that the collective-bargaining agreement of the women’s team systematically disadvantages the team relative to their male counterparts. In fact, the reverse might be true.To remove biological factors — speed and strength — from the equation a priori and proceed to claim that men’s and women’s teams are equally “skilled” is to reduce “skill” to a relative category, one unmoored from the physical traits that manifestly affect performance on the soccer field. As the plaintiffs themselves concede, there are “biological differences” between the two sexes in speed and strength, differences that are 9. Soccer star and lefty bigmouth Meghan Rapinoe finds herself to be a victim, unfairly paid compared to dudes. John Hirschauer says she ain’t. The coronavirus is here, and it has sentenced most of us to anywhere from a few weeks to several months of a situation we’d much prefer to avoid. No classes, no hanging around with coworkers, no PTA meetings, no Little League or youth soccer, no going out with buddies to the ball game or concert, never or rarely going to the movies. Visits to Grandma and Grandpa’s house are becoming calculated risks. Few of us will be experiencing the joys and inconveniences of air travel. No family reunions, no in-person conferences . . . Perhaps we’ll once again go to the beach as summer approaches, but maybe we’ll still be keeping our distance.The “good life” as defined by much of modern America isn’t always that exciting. Jobs can turn into drudgery. The ones we love the most in our family can get on our nerves, and we can bicker and fight. We dream of taking that big trip, and then end up dealing with all kinds of snafus as we gallivant across the country. We go to a party and find ourselves meeting that guy who just won’t shut up. The pre-coronavirus rules of social interaction meant dealing with a lot of people we would prefer to avoid.Normal life in America suddenly screeched nearly to a halt last week. And even though normal life pre-coronavirus was far from perfect, we will soon miss it, if we don’t already.Maybe this is what we’re in for: something terrible that, once we’ve endured it, leaves us better able to appreciate what is good. Right now, it looks as though we’re going to witness frightening reports of increasing numbers of sick people around the globe. We hope that number of victims rises only slowly and then finally stops. Already, we know we are not going to forget this — the bizarre runs on toilet paper, the 2,000-point swings in the stock market, the obsession with Purell and hand-washing — and the sneaking suspicion that before this, most people just didn’t wash their hands nearly as often as they should.8. Our godfather, But the dark side of urbanization has always included infectious disease. Humans did not evolve to live in such close proximity. Close physical contact spreads germs, which is why medieval and early-modern cities were so pestilential. London became the first city to break two million people in the early 1800s, and it suffered terrible outbreaks of cholera (then a brand-new disease) in the following decades. While sanitation has solved many of the old problems of disease, apartment buildings and mass transit still force people together in much closer quarters than houses and cars.  And today, the most densely packed Western cities face the greatest risk, with Paris and San Francisco taking the extreme step of “shelter-in-place” orders, and New York’s mayor openly pondering the same thing.There are undoubted advantages to urban life. Concentrating large numbers of people in small areas means larger workforces with more diverse skills, easier access to mass transit, and economies of scale in everything from public services to cultural institutions, such as museums and sports teams. Even the things that let us stay at home — from internet service to grocery and take-out delivery — are easier to get in cities. Those dynamics explain much of why this is a longstanding global phenomenon.The relentless march of urbanization, in the United States and around the world, has been coming for a long time. Using the Census Bureau’s expansive definition of an “urban area” as 2,500 or more people, America went from Crises have a way of shocking us out of complacency to consider how fragile and vulnerable civilization still is, and always will be. In the short run, that means 7. There’s a downside to mega-urbanization, and the Coronavirus epidemic reveals it, writes Dan McLaughlin. The main thing to look at is employment, not unemployment. How many Americans are earning a paycheck? Many service providers can work from home. Many cannot. The ones who cannot, who don’t keep their job because of the worries about the virus, they’re not going to be producing anything. So the so-called stimulus is likely to flow into areas that are fairly healthy. Netflix is going to be fine. My podcast is going to keep on going. For people who can’t telecommute, all the stimulus spending in the world isn’t going to help. If we run out of toilet paper, having more money in your pocket is not going to help you get toilet paper, it’s going to bid up the price of the existing toilet paper.<strong>RR:</strong><strong>DT:</strong><strong>RR:</strong><strong>DT:</strong>6. Daniel Tenreiro and economist Russell Roberts have an engaging Q&A about Coronavirus and the free market. When faced with what’s been called a once-in-a-generation pathogen, would we rather have a robust commercial drug industry or not? Brilliant, creative people scattered throughout companies and universities working to be the first to a solution or not? Investors looking to back promising research or not?Yes, they make money doing it, but the profit motive is the reason they exist in the first place. There’s a reason we introduce more new therapies than any country in the world.Bernie’s view that drug-company executives are “crooks” betrays his Marxoid belief that profit is a form of theft. Of course, even people who aren’t socialists are scourges of the industry. Pharma brought much of this on itself with the opioid debacle. Yet these companies routinely create medical miracles.This would seem the least of our problems right now, but the pharmaceutical industry is such a boogeyman that it gets roundly attacked even while racing to provide a boon to public health.Op-eds have sprung up warning: “Drug Companies Will Make a Killing From Coronavirus” (The 5. Those evil pharmaceutical companies! The liberal idiocies come under attack from Rich Lowry, as America’s drug companies move heaven and earth to fight this virus. Over time, this led to the breeding and distribution of these animals, and small rural outposts developed into larger-scale operations. Add to this the use of wild animals not only for consumption but as the supposedly magic ingredients in tonics and alternative medicines, and it is obvious that what began as subsistence farming for the rural poor has developed into a substantial industry. Wuhan, a city most Americans had never heard of before this year, is larger than New York City.Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, in the late 1970s lifted state controls on rural farming to allow peasant farmers to provide for their own sustenance. Rats, bats, civet cats, pangolins, and other wild animals became staples of rural farming. To acknowledge and even encourage this, the government enacted laws that protected “the lawful rights of those engaged in the development or utilization of wildlife resources.”The wild animals that mix with more common livestock — poultry, swine, and seafood — form a deadly combination. And, as has been well reported by Wet markets are found the world over, typically open-air sites selling fresh meat, seafood, and produce. The meats often are butchered and trimmed on-site. Markets in China have come in for justifiable condemnation because of the way they’ve evolved, commingling traditional livestock with a wide variety of wild animals, including exotic and endangered species. Many are quite unsanitary, with blood, entrails, excrement, and other waste creating the conditions for disease that migrates from animals to people through virus, bacteria, and other forms of transmission. Such “zoonotic diseases” that have emerged from China and other regions of the world include Ebola, HIV, bird flu, swine flu, and SARS.4. Obvious but necessary: Therese Shaheen calls for an end to China’s disease-breeding wild / weird animal farming. It never seems to occur to the press corps overall just how much damage they are doing to their collective reputation when its members (continue to) behave in such an obviously petty manner, as some did at a White House briefing today. We’ve all seen the surveys that tell us that As is often the case, there is an element of trolling to the president’s word choice when he refers to the novel coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” or the “China virus.” But as far as we know, the virus did indeed originate in Wuhan. The truth is an absolute defense to a charge of racism, and reporters who waste everyone’s time grilling the president on this matter as though this is the time when they will finally get him to admit to racism are also guilty of trolling.3. Truth isn’t racist, ChiComs (and their U.S. media water carriers). Kyle Smith explains. But while the Spanish have a good case to be annoyed, the Chinese government does not. As Jim Geraghty The latter was, until very recently, widely referred to as the “Spanish flu,” a virus that killed around 675,000 Americans and tens of millions of others around the world in the early 1900s. “Spanish flu” has now retroactively fallen into disfavor as well. And to be fair, there is some historical evidence that the virus may actually have originated in Anyway, “COVID-19” or “H1N1” don’t exactly roll off the tongue.But naming viral diseases after places — Guinea Worm, West Nile Virus, Ebola, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, etc. — is probably just intuitive. Viruses “come” from someplace, after all, and thus people gravitate to those names. I doubt we came up with “Lyme disease” because of some deep enmity towards Connecticut.There are many traditional naming conventions that don’t really make that much sense. Somewhat weirdly, for example, we often name diseases after the people who “discover” them — Hodgkin’s disease after Thomas Hodgkin, Parkinson’s disease after James Parkinson, and so on.2. China needs to own this curse it has unleashed upon the world, says David Harsanyi. Yet, no thanks to the Chinese, America, so far, has been comparatively lucky — despite the grave risks of damaging a multi-trillion-dollar economy with the strictest quarantining, isolation policies, and social distancing in its history. Half the country lives in the interior away from ports of entry on the coasts. Medical care, sanitation, hygiene, and meat markets operate on different premises than in China, the supposed fated global hegemon. Transparency in a consensual society together with a free-market economy is encouraging tens of millions of citizens to work in tandem and independently to figure out creative ways to ameliorate the epidemic, politically, medically, socially, and economically. The result is that as of mid-March, the U.S., the world’s foremost immigration destination and among the most visited of nations, had suffered fewer virus fatalities than some European countries a fifth or sixth of its population size.All this laxity was also known to the Communist apparat in Beijing, which must have been amused when Trump was roundly damned by his liberal critics as a xenophobe and racist for finally daring to stop the influx on January 31 — the first major leader to enact such a total ban.Yet the government initially hid all that knowledge from its own people in particular and in general from the world at large. Translated into American terms, that disingenuousness ensured that over 10,000 Chinese nationals and foreigners living in China flew every day on direct flights into the United States (Washington and California especially) from late November to the beginning of February, until the Trump travel ban of January 31.Sometime in late November the Chinese Communist Party apparat was aware that the ingredients of some sort of an epidemic were brewing in Wuhan. Soon after, it was also clear to them that a new type of coronavirus was on the loose, a threat they might have taken more seriously given the similar Chinese origins of the prior toxic SARS coronavirus and the resources of a Level 4 virology lab nearby.1. Victor Davis Hanson says that there will indeed be a China boomerang. <strong>You Wanted a Dozen Links? Well, We’re Giving You That . . . and More! Belly Up to the NR Buffet.</strong>A new disease can crop up anywhere. We do not blame Beijing for that. We blame Beijing for the We are all now paying a price for that corruption and stupidity.Beijing’s vanity — and its insecurity — gave the coronavirus “a critical monthlong head start,” as James Palmer put it in 1. <strong>Editorials</strong>And you’ll The updated and expanded edition of Victor Davis Hanson’s 2019 bestseller, <strong>But First . . .</strong>More on that below, in addition to the plethora of wisdom-directing links await your attentive and anticipating eyes and sanity.The day they will rue approaches.

Beijing’s Foreign Ministry mouthpieces are warning us (“insensible”) that we should not try to restore vital industries — such as pharmaceuticals and medical supplies — to production on our shores. So, let’s apply the old question: New bosses, same as the old bosses? Xi whiz, ya think? The old ones never fretted over the corpses of dead Chinese peasants — should we really be surprised that there is even less concern over how the Wuhan bat-brewed biological bogey ravages Time to deep-six the inattention.

No charge.This doesn’t mean we should all rush to the nearest beach this weekend, assuming that the miracle cure is on its way. But as pharmaceutical company Bayer seeks approval from the FDA to sell its chloroquine product in the U.S. to be used on an emergency basis to treat COVID-19, there’s no reason in the world for a leading newspaper to trivialize scientific evidence for the sake of attacking the president.“In the end, despite what the NYT says, I am very optimistic about this development. I think that the headline is misleading,” Austriaco concluded. “Yes, there is minimal evidence but that is not unexpected in a pandemic. But the minimal evidence is actually pretty solid, given the practical limits of doing clinical trials in a global crisis. Yet, when both in vitro and in vivo studies converge, that is an optimistic sign. Especially when you have a mechanism of action that is reasonable and is in line with what we know about viral reproduction.”Of the Chinese study, Austriaco wrote, “They were able to provide a mechanism of action for this anti-viral activity, and it is a reasonable one. (For molecular biologists, mechanism makes all the difference in the world!) Briefly, it alters the pH of the parts of the cell necessary for viral reproduction.” He added that the “molecular evidence for anti-viral function” makes the clinical-study results more promising.In a Facebook post yesterday, Austriaco wrote that he was “struck by the attempts of these Of course, like the president, I can’t predict whether HCQ will work. Nor am I a scientist with an advanced understanding of antimalarials. But based on what I’ve read, I think there’s reason for some optimism. On this subject, I found useful some commentary from American microbiologist and Dominican priest Nicanor Austriaco, who has a PhD in biology from MIT and is chief researcher at the Austriaco lab at Providence College.“I feel good about it. And we’re going to see. You’re going to see soon enough,” Trump said. Hardly comments bad enough to require the According to the No one should suggest, based on the available evidence, that HCQ is some sort of silver bullet that will cure COVID-19 and get us out of this global crisis. But neither should reporters cover a possible positive development from the angle of how best they can disparage the president. And Trump’s comments about the drug, though perhaps more optimistic than warranted, were not unreasonable.Another The article went on to claim that the president had “exaggerated the potential of drugs available to treat the new coronavirus, including an experimental antiviral treatment and decades-old malaria remedies that hint of promise but so far show limited evidence of healing the sick.”“With Minimal Evidence, Trump Asks F.D.A. to Study Malaria Drugs for Coronavirus,” the headline reads.

Too much can damage your brain.The inability to grasp the concept of dosages is endemic in reporting by journalists or commentary by pundits or politicians on any topic touching on science. What’s a carcinogen? Anything that can cause cancer in a sufficiently large dose. But lots of things can mess up your system in a sufficiently large dose. Enough water can kill you. Indeed, cancer itself is nothing more than an internal overdose of biological processes necessary to life. The same is true of a number of immune-system diseases. Climate-science reporting is full of this fallacy, too: The assumption that “enough carbon released into the atmosphere will change the climate” means “any carbon released into the atmosphere will change the climate.” In fact, there is all the difference in the world between pouring one bucket of water into the ocean, and pouring the ocean into one bucket of water.Well, yes, almost any medicine — especially one strong enough to fight an infectious disease — can also harm or even kill you from an overdose. That’s where the word “overdose” comes from. We’ve known since Paracelsus, the 16th-century father of toxicology, that “the dose makes the poison.” Yes, it’s an important caution to prescribing physicians to note that this is a drug whose potentially lethal dose is only twice the recommended daily treatment. But I’m guessing that most of the president’s Twitter followers do not have big stocks of chloroquine sitting on their shelves.The drug touted by the U.S. President Donald Trump as a possible line of treatment against the coronavirus comes with severe warnings in China and can kill in dosages as little as two grams. China . . . recommended the decades-old malaria drug chloroquine to treat infected patients in guidelines issued in February after seeing encouraging results in clinical trials. But within days, it cautioned doctors and health officials about the drug’s lethal side effects and rolled back its usage. This came after local media reported that a Wuhan Institute of Virology study found that the drug can kill an adult just dosed at twice the daily amount recommended for treatment, which is one gram.<a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-new-york-times-downplays-promising-covid-19-development/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">As Alexandra notes</a>

Seven hundred ninety-three people died yesterday alone, and the growth in the number of dead has been consistent over the past few days, meaning the national lockdown has not yet “flattened the curve” of deaths. One caveat: The high death rate in Italy may reflect the way in which Italian hospitals determine cause of death. An Italian doctor told the After initial obstacles, the U.S. has succeeded in massively increasing its testing capacity.

Yesterday, the FDA Ten American states now have more than 500 confirmed cases of coronavirus. In comparison, twelve Chinese clusters reached 500 cases (according to the available data, which is by no means totally trustworthy). Most of the outbreaks outside of Wuhan seem to have been contained early, whereas in the U.S., the number of cases within each cluster continues to grow exponentially. New York remains the epicenter of the domestic outbreak, with more than 11,000 confirmed cases. However, New York is carrying out more tests per capita than other states, so the numbers don’t necessarily reflect the severity of each statewide outbreak. Fifty-five percent of those infected in New York are between the ages of 18 and 55, which, while troublesome, bodes well for the death rate, as COVID-19 is most deadly in elderly populations.

That is one thing that probably led to the current disaster.”Major hospitals such as Bergamo’s “are themselves becoming sources of [coronavirus] infection,” Cereda said, with Covid-19 patients indirectly transmitting infections to non-Covid-19 patients. Ambulances and infected personnel, especially those without symptoms, carry the contagion both to other patients and back into the community.One such step reflects the finding that hospitals might be “the main” source of Covid-19 transmission, the Bergamo doctors warned. The related coronavirus illness MERS also has high transmission rates within hospitals, as did SARS during its 2003 epidemic.STAT News “On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus, while 88 per cent of patients who have died have at least one pre-morbidity – many had two or three,” he says.“The way in which we code deaths in our country is very generous in the sense that all the people who die in hospitals with the coronavirus are deemed to be dying of the coronavirus.But Prof Ricciardi added that Italy’s death rate may also appear high because of how doctors record fatalities.A study in JAMA this week found that almost 40 per cent of infections and 87 per cent of deaths in the country have been in patients over 70 years old.“The age of our patients in hospitals is substantially older – the median is 67, while in China it was 46,” Prof Ricciardi says. “So essentially the age distribution of our patients is squeezed to an older age and this is substantial in increasing the lethality.”According to Prof Walter Ricciardi, scientific adviser to Italy’s minister of health, the country’s mortality rate is far higher due to demographics – the nation has the second oldest population worldwide – and the manner in which hospitals record deaths.The With the benefit of hindsight, Italian officials say certainly not.“Are we sure we want to do this?” he said he asked them. “Should we be here today?”Michele Geraci, Italy’s former under secretary in the economic development ministry and a booster of closer relations with China, had a drink with other politicians but looked around uneasily.On Jan. 21, as top Chinese officials warned that those hiding virus cases “will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity,” Italy’s culture and tourism minister hosted a Chinese delegation for a concert at the National Academy of Santa Cecilia to inaugurate the year of Italy-China Culture and Tourism.It also wasn’t an ideal time for cultural exchanges with China:The The body count The numbers in Italy keep getting worse, with nearly 800 fatalities on Saturday.

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Daniel Tenreiro’s invaluable homepage updates This is not a hypothetical point: South Korea managed to control its outbreak without ever resorting to mass closures. It did so through a combination of massive testing, rigorous contact tracing, and isolation of the infected. Not only were people with symptoms tested and quarantined, but authorities went through considerable effort to track down people who may have been in contact with the sick and test them as well.The crucial lesson is that We already have a gold standard for fighting epidemics: early identification of symptomatic patients, contact tracing, isolation of those infected and exposed, and widespread random sampling of the population to detect new outbreaks among unidentified contacts. Only by identifying and isolating the sick can the healthy get back to work.That doesn’t mean the shutdown is the only way to deal with the pandemic. As Schulman goes on to argue, the U.S. was forced to take such an extreme measure only because our early response was insufficient:Various answers suggest themselves. We might say that the shutdown can end when the case curve bends: That is, when new daily confirmed cases peak and decline. We might also look for the share of tests returning positive to steadily decline, suggesting that testing is finally widespread enough to capture most cases. Perhaps most importantly, we might look for a peak and decline in Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths.The most urgent task for the president and national leaders is to articulate the purpose of the shutdown, what it aims to achieve, and how we will know when we have. The current answer — “It is not possible to place meaningful estimates on the true economic cost of [the worst-case scenario in which the virus spreads unchecked], except to say that there is good reason to believe it would be worse than the current shutdown.

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span> Even in the preindustrial age, the sense of hysteria that accompanies a pandemic explains why both Thucydides and Procopius are more famous for their descriptions of the reactions to a plague than even their astute and empirical descriptions of its symptoms.Despite the prior Ebola, MERS, SARS, and H1NI scares, the COVID-19 is the first truly worldwide meltdown, in the 21st-century globalized age of social media and the Internet. Instant unfiltered opinion adds to the panic and yet in some cases can aid rapid responses in finding cures and vaccinations. We are reacting much as did past plague sufferers (though with far more volatility), whose pandemics in terms of relative lethality were far more devastating.7) Finally, reliable information is so scarce, and erroneous news is so volatile, politicized, and often sensational that any analysis is either outdated by the time it is read, or it’s based on conventional wisdom that almost hourly is revealed as fake news.FDR perhaps found the right formula after Pearl Harbor. He warned Americans that full mobilization would be necessary to achieve what he assured them would be the sure defeat of Japan, at a time when U.S. Pacific forces were already doomed to suffer substantial losses for the next six months without let-up — and yet the U.S. Navy was also already prepped to build and launch an entirely new fleet by 1943–44, larger eventually than the world’s combined navies of the time.In contrast, the realist or optimist, if proven wrong, appears reckless, insensitive, even murderous. Even when right, he is deemed either lucky despite his recklessness, or proven prescient only thanks to those less cheery who ignored his unrealistic prognostications and took extreme measures to achieve what he predicted on surely false and unreliable data. That may be why early spikes in the death rate caused panic, and later declines comparative inattention.Psychologically, the expert statistician is more likely to err of the side of predicting catastrophe than amelioration, given that one is a win-win proposition, and the other a lose-lose surety. In retrospect, the pessimist’s incorrect warnings nevertheless are to be credited for inducing the needed panic to enact necessary remedies, while he appears a savior if he is correct in his prognosis. So, in a crisis, it seems wiser to overestimate the dangers than to underestimate them.In a crisis, pessimism is usually more likely than optimism or realism to galvanize needed responses — at least up to a point of avoiding widespread defeatism and nihilism.Still, in general, the historical psychology of plagues and panics is instructive: Pessimists who call for Draconian measures are credited with saving lives, not endangering far more lives through the severe countermeasures they take.Those who urge caution, regarding the economic impacts, are also more likely to be damned as putting money over lives, even if they are more worried about lives than money in the event that a severe recession follows. And, of course, exaggeration is a two-way street — those favoring a relaxation of the shutdown may also embellish the economic costs of the present stagnation.In contrast, those who advise caution out of fears of an economic meltdown will never be able to quantify the greater number of fatalities from a depression than from an infection. It is more difficult to tie likely spikes in suicides, postponed or canceled medical procedures, increased substance abuse, crime, ruined lives, etc. directly to the virus, even though the link is highly likely.The psychology of erring on either side is important to note: Those calling far more severe precautions that will further harm the economy do so in the admirable agenda to lower the deaths (in the sense that one dead American is a tragedy), and they can quantify their efforts in the known number of dead.6) We do not know where it is yet, but there exists a golden mean between proper mobilization against the COVID-19 and proper circumspection needed to avoid a recession or great depression. We all agree that what this means is a nearly normal economy as tens of millions are tested and those who test positive and their contacts are quarantined, isolated, or restricted in their activities in the manner of tuberculosis, early AIDS, or measles, freeing up resources to concentrate on the elderly and chronically ill. But no one knows when this golden mean should be enacted.A caveat here: Under the present set of radically changed circumstances of the past eleven years — the current role of China, a different media and domestic politics, an election year, etc. — the mindset of 2020 transferred back to 2009 would most likely have radically changed what was then public response to the H1N1 influenza A virus. Under today’s perceptions, an eventual 60 million (?) infected Americans, and 15,000 (?) deaths at some point would have prompted similar shutdowns and lockdowns.So the point is that we wish to concentrate on getting the lethality rate down, both to save the most vulnerable and to reassure a terrified public that we might get to a point where their fears should be commensurate with those typical of a characteristically bad flu year.The morbidity of the infected may be as severe or more severe than with a severe flu, but we do not know this other than from media-generated frightening anecdotes.5) So far, the lethality rate is the key datum, given that, from what we tentatively know, the vast majority of people who recover have had no greater percentages of permanent lung or other organ damage than did those with the flu (this could change, of course, with further study).In general, however, political, cultural, economic, and climatic disparities make it hard to rely on comparisons, other than in a general fashion, between countries.One might wonder how Germany is both doing an average job of preventing infections and a superb job in preventing coronavirus deaths. Or one might suspect that Germany may be better in finding and testing more of the infected, while using a different standard of ascertaining actual coronavirus deaths.Germany so far seems to have both lots more per capita infections (0.02 percent versus 0.001 percent) than we do in the U.S., and yet it has far fewer fatalities per positive cases (0.3–0.4 percent) than does the U.S (1.1–1.2 percent). Yet in terms of per capita fatalities, the two countries are doing about the same (0.0001 percent of the general population dying from the disease).Italy is probably sui genesis in the Western context, for a variety of now often noted perfect-storm reasons — e.g., it has a more elderly population, a larger than average Chinese expatriate population, laxity in stopping travel from China and closing its borders, a greater percentage of elderly male smokers, suspect emergency health care, perhaps greater frequency of younger people living at home with their elders, lower per capita income ($38,000 versus $60,000 in the U.S.); pre-virus, it also had much higher unemployment (10 percent versus 3.5 percent in the U.S.).China, of course, for domestic and foreign-policy reason, has an interest in declaring victory and posing as the model of public-health policy —  the new savior to those threatened by its own perfidy (which it now fobs off on the U.S.).4) We should be somewhat suspect of data outside the U.S.Even in California the natural reaction to the virus is quite different in Palo Alto than in rural Fresno County, a mere 200 miles away. These regional differences in reactions to the virus may soon be overwhelmed by a true national pandemic that finds its way into deserts, mountains, and great plains. But so far how we perceive the virus is in part influenced by how those in harder-hit states perceive it —especially in terms of relative fears of a deadly, second-phase viral explosion versus the all too human consequences of a great depression.Broadcasting from a studio or writing a column in New York, or living in Malibu or Beverly Hills, or working as a blogger-coder in Menlo Park, or working for Amazon in Seattle must affect a person’s perceptions and provide him greater exposure, compared with others who are in between such places — at least so far. ,In some sense, our coverage and information of the virus reflect the greater influence of areas experiencing perceived greater viral ubiquity (though not always on a per capita basis) than say the experiences of Americans in a Kentucky, Utah, New Mexico, or Oklahoma.3) The highest case numbers and deaths, as one would imagine, so far are in bicoastal, highly populated states, marked by either media and entertainment centers, numerous Chinese visitors and residents, or high-tech and financial nexuses — such as California, New York, New Jersey, and Washington State.We then are left with a paradox: Testing shows that many more Americans have had or have the virus than we now assume from prior tests, and many more Americans are recovering from it than we once expected.c) If current daily small percentage declines in the fatality rate were to continue as the case numbers increase, we could approach flu-like levels as is almost true of Germany. This poses the dilemma: Did this encouraging trend occur because of our proper reaction to the virus, or were we mistaken about the lethality of the virus in the landscape of the U.S., or both, or neither?b) The real case number could be perhaps two or three times higher than tested positives, also given that many who are or were ill either did not get tested, or did not know they were ill, or did not know they were ill from the coronavirus.a) Those seeking tests are mostly those with some sort of malaise or exposure, and yet they test overwhelmingly (so far) negative, perhaps at rates, depending on locale, of 80 percent to 90 percent negative (an increasingly not widely reported fact), and thus they may underrepresent percentages of the infected in the general population.2) The media hype the increased number of cases (the denominator) without much attention to the number of deaths (the numerator) caused by, or perhaps mostly by, the virus. The numerator, however, is not increasing daily at a rate that’s commensurate with the denominator, despite a number of important other extenuating criteria:Is he merely erratic? Perhaps any smart president at this moment would prefer both to galvanize Americans about the threat of Chinese near monopolies of industries key to the U.S. in extremis (such as medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and rare earths) and  yet to not to so offend our  only importer that it cuts off a vulnerable U.S. in the middle of a crisis.1) Trump is criticized as both “racist” and “xenophobic” in his condemnations of the “Chinese” virus, while he’s also criticized for “appeasing” President Xi when he makes friendly references to their coronavirus chats. How can Trump be both?There are a lot of known unknowns and paradoxes in these times of uncertainty. Here are a few.National ReviewFollow Us",0,The Psychology of Viral Paradoxes

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>University of Washington biology professor Carl Bergstrom took Too many experts have an insular tendency to assume they will be believed just from credentials, because their friends believe them that way. And too many hear clever amateurs say “I’m asking questions” and immediately treat them like Holocaust deniers or moon-landing skeptics, when we are in fact dealing with a data set that is evolving daily and full of uncertainties. Interrogating the elite, expert narratives is important. That is doubly true when you remember that most of the population is getting its information from ignorant second-hand sources that are just as likely to be too alarmist as too dismissive.But stifling those points of view and hand-waving them with “shut up, I’m an expert” is not a healthy way for democracies to make important decisions. Expertise is valuable at a time like this, but it is only Ginn and Hart, unlike Ioannidis and Katz, are data guys without a medical background. Those of us who are amateurs at medicine in general and epidemiology in particular should have some humility in working through competing claims on these points. Generally applicable statistical principles are important, but so is knowing how they apply to a specific area. I’ve spent enough time over the years working with baseball statistics, public opinion polls, and analysis of stock price movements to recognize that the general concepts that are common across disciplines also need to deal with the specific characteristics of the real-world things being measured by the data.The data from South Korea, where tracking the coronavirus has been by far the best to date, indicate that as much as 99 percent of active cases in the general population are “mild” and do not require specific medical treatment. The small percentage of cases that do require such services are highly concentrated among those age 60 and older, and further so the older people are…These conclusions are corroborated by the data from Wuhan, China, which show a higher death rate, but an almost identical distribution. The higher death rate in China may be real, but is perhaps a result of less widespread testing…We have, to date, fewer than 200 deaths from the coronavirus in the United States — a small data set from which to draw big conclusions. Still, it is entirely aligned with the data from other countries. The deaths have been mainly clustered among the elderly, those with significant chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease, and those in both groups.David Katz of Yale University’s Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center (a CDC-funded public health research institution), Projecting the Diamond Princess mortality rate onto the age structure of the U.S. population, the death rate among people infected with Covid-19 would be 0.125%. But since this estimate is based on extremely thin data — there were just seven deaths among the 700 infected passengers and crew — the real death rate could stretch from five times lower (0.025%) to five times higher (0.625%)…reasonable estimates for the case fatality ratio in the general U.S. population vary from 0.05% to 1%. That huge range markedly affects how severe the pandemic is and what should be done. A population-wide case fatality rate of 0.05% is lower than seasonal influenza… The most valuable piece of information for answering those questions would be to know the current prevalence of the infection in a random sample of a population and to repeat this exercise at regular time intervals to estimate he incidence of new infections. Sadly, that’s information we don’t have.How do we make those decisions? Whether or not you agree with Ginn’s arguments for, say, reopening schools, people like Ginn and Aaron Ginn wrote a long, charts-and-statistics-filled blog post at Medium arguing that the available public health data shows that COVID-19 is less easily transmitted, less fatal, and more likely to fade away with the hot weather than the conventional wisdom would have you believe.

No charge.I’m eager to return to the marbled church where I worship, but until it reopens, I and hundreds of thousands of other Catholics around the country and the world will have to take solace in such things until we can glimpse the red lamp once again.I was also reminded of one appeal of hearing the Mass in the Church’s mother tongue — an appeal that obtains in general, but all the more so in a situation like this — namely, the small-c catholicity of the Latinate liturgy. In South Korea, Italy, Germany, or Sarasota, Fla., all Catholics watching the Tridentine Mass this morning heard to the same words, the same prayers, the same chants, recited in one language, common to all sons and daughters of the Church.Catholics in my diocese are still obliged to observe the Lord’s day — my writing this post probably violates the obligation to “rest” of my “labors,” come to think of it — which could include an activity such as streaming Mass from one’s computer, as I did this morning. The Tridentine Mass I watched was celebrated before an empty chapel, with one priest and one deacon. There were no hymns, no congregants, and no popular responsorials. I am a minimalist as far as popular participation in the liturgy is concerned, but it was altogether jarring to see the Lord’s sacrifice carried forth in such desolation.This is first time that I can recall my diocesan bishop dispensing Catholics of their Sunday Mass obligation. It may well have happened before in my lifetime — my memory is fairly reliable, as these things go, but is not infallible. This Sunday has nevertheless been a strange disruption to one as myself who takes solace in the Church’s constancy.Scores of dioceses around the country have suspended public Masses in response to the viral outbreak. Some have stopped offering confessions for all but those penitents in need of extreme unction. In those areas of the country with particularly high incidences of COVID-19, the sacramental life of the Church has ground to a virtual halt.Many Catholics this weekend found themselves offering versions of Magdalene’s lament.Troubled by the Virgin’s message to the seers at Fatima, Monsignor Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli — who would later become Pope Pius XII — warned the Italian architect Enrico Pietro Galeazzi that a day was soon coming when “Christians will search in vain for the red lamp where God awaits them.” “Like Mary Magdalene, weeping before the empty tomb, they will ask, ‘Where have they taken Him?’”National ReviewFollow Us",0,Mass at Home

Now is the time to move forward, with President Tsai coming off a resounding election victory and President Trump looking for policy successes as the November election approaches. The U.S. should be prepared for what turns out to be a powerful economic rebound once the COVID-19 virus subsides.Perhaps anticipating objections from the usual bipartisan protectionists, the members emphasized the potential for expanding markets for U.S. exports, including food, an emphasis that should appeal to President Trump, since he is concerned to win back support from farmers who suffered from his trade war with China. To the Left, which most worries about low-wage foreign competition, the writers noted that “Taiwan already affords its workers a high standard of labor protection, consistent with International Labor Organization conventions, and is a leader in environmental protection in the region.”In December, 161 members of Congress sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, urging him to open negotiations with Taiwan. They argued: “As the trade and investment relationship with Taiwan already supports an estimated 373,000 U.S. jobs, working toward the negotiation of a high-standard and comprehensive U.S.–Taiwan bilateral trade agreement would further enhance our shared goal of enhancing the global competitiveness of U.S. industries while spurring American job creation.”Moreover, trade with Taiwan is on individual members’ minds. Last year Senator Cory Gardner (R., Col.) and Representative Ted Yoho (R., Fla.) cited trade when welcoming President Tsai to Hawaii.Despite the virulent partisanship on Capitol Hill, a Taiwan free-trade agreement probably would pass. Although Republicans traditionally have backed Taiwan more strongly and Democrats less so, China has few friends in Congress these days. Congress has approved resolutions reaffirming the Taiwan Relations Act, on its 40th anniversary; the Taiwan Travel Act, which allows high-level official visits both ways; and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which reaffirms the relationship with Taiwan. Last year the House also approved the Taiwan Assurance Act, which reinforces U.S. commitment to Taiwan, affirms Taiwan’s strategic importance, and urges continued military sales to it. Both chambers also approved the TAIPEI Act, though they have yet to resolve their differences. The TAIPEI Act provides for administration consultation with Congress over economic ties between the two governments.Getting the president on board for Taiwan might help spur his or a future administration to propose additional bilateral FTAs in Asia. That could help make up for the loss of the TPP. Indeed, one or more FTAs might help revive the TPP, which would have improved access for U.S. products throughout Asia while strengthening the region’s economic ties with America. Perhaps that pact, already implemented by its other adherents, could be rebranded and the president convinced that the new iteration was his idea.He should see how a trade agreement would expand American ties with Taipei. And so long as even the PRC acknowledges that Taiwan is a separate system even if not, in Beijing’s view, a separate country, then the Taiwanese have a right to make their own economic arrangements with the U.S., as has Hong Kong.Trump might fear that moving forward with Taiwan could interfere with completion of his trade-war negotiations with Beijing — round two is planned but not certain of success. On the other hand, he might see dual negotiations as an opportunity to press the PRC at a time of relative weakness, as it emerges from the coronavirus crisis. Moreover, the president has shown an interest in Taiwan, despite sometimes retreating when pushed by Beijing. He recently approved a new tranche of arms sales to Taipei.Would a president who dislikes trade move forward? Proponents should stress the political and security benefits. After all, he has flunked the trade issue. He focuses on the trade deficit, which is an irrelevant accounting fiction. He denounced good arrangements, NAFTA and the Korean Free Trade Agreement, made marginal (and largely negative) changes to them, and then sold them as historic triumphs. Worse, he killed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was economically beneficial and designed to achieve the political goal of diminishing China’s economic reach in Asia Pacific.A trade agreement would also improve Taipei’s ability to deter the PRC militarily through increased defense investment, buttressed by continued U.S. weapons sales, despite Beijing’s very loud displeasure. A Taiwan made more prosperous through a trade deal would be better able to protect itself. Taipei doesn’t have to defeat the PRC. It only needs to make the price of a Beijing victory unacceptably high.An FTA would improve Taiwan’s possibility of entering international economic organizations on an ad hoc basis. It will be harder for Beijing to demand Taiwan’s exclusion from international agencies if Taipei remains a significant economic power, prosperous and profitable. This helps Taiwan preserve space in the international system.An FTA would solidify Taipei’s international presence, tighten its international integration, and improve its economic prospects. Increased prosperity as a result of an FTA with the United States would aid Taiwan’s efforts to retain its current recognitions. Beijing has been pressing hard to flip more of the few countries that still recognize Taipei — both Kiribati and the Solomon Islands flipped last fall. The Trump administration wants to punish such countries, which have only done what America did four decades ago. A new trade agreement would be a better alternative.Such a pact would offer political as well as economic benefits, solidifying Taiwan’s international presence and tightening its international integration. Washington has used NAFTA and agreements with South Korea, Australia, and several Latin American nations to draw its partners closer. Taiwan ‘s prosperity has helped it preserve its separate identity even as the PRC has grown dramatically; a free-trade agreement would offer Taipei a small boost. “National security and foreign policy considerations should argue in favor of arrangements that further sustain Taiwan’s economic welfare,” Lardy and Rosen have noted.Moreover, PRC obstruction made it difficult for Taipei to negotiate greater economic integration with its neighbors. More than a decade ago Nicholas R. Lardy and Daniel H. Rosen of the Institute of International Relations contended that “a U.S.–Taiwan FTA might help overcome this reluctance.” Even if it did not, the benefits of a bilateral FTA would help Taipei keep pace as its neighbors reached agreements among themselves. A new trade agreement would have other economic benefits. The PRC’s campaign against Taiwan includes efforts to make the island more dependent on Beijing. Walters has pointed to new Chinese incentives for “Taiwanese investment in China’s fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications development, high-tech research and development, and other sectors, such as tourism, finance, and agriculture.” An FTA would expand Taiwan’s alternatives and options as their nation’s economic embrace of China continues to tighten naturally as a result of language, culture, and geography. Taiwan could reduce its reliance on the Chinese “as they increase their political influence in Taiwan, primarily using economic actors,” President Tsai said.One stumbling block in the past has been Taiwan’s ban on American beef and pork, treated with ractopamine, a drug that results in leaner meat. AmCham has advocated that Taipei “make an all-out effort to demonstrate to the U.S. that Taiwan would be a highly appropriate candidate for a bilateral trade agreement.” That means eliminating any “existing irritants” and demonstrating “Taiwan’s deep commitment to international standards, respect for sound scientific evidence, and dedication to a fair and open international trading system.” In early February the Heritage Foundation’s Riley Walters noted that “an effort by the new Taiwanese government and Legislative Yuan to address [this issue] would go a long way to promoting the opening of FTA talks.”Unsurprisingly, the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) supports such an agreement. More important, Taiwanese concern over Chinese pressure makes Taipei likely to strike a deal. President Tsai said, “If we can have a breakthrough in trade with the U.S., this will be very helpful in terms of encouraging many other trading partners to do the same.” Last June, Taiwan’s chief trade negotiator — and minister without portfolio — Deng Chen-chung said that Taipei will “always be ready” to forge an FTA. He urged talks without preconditions, to maximize “flexibility” and “space.”Foreign direct investment also runs both ways. In 2017, the flow from the U.S. to Taiwan was $17.0 billion. Taiwan invested $8.1 billion in America. Although that figure is modest in absolute terms, Taiwan is the 15th-largest investor in the U.S. Given the extensive trade and relatively low existing tariffs, non-tariff barriers deserve special attention. Intellectual-property protection is one important concern. Although the economic benefits of an FTA likely would be modest, the gains essentially are free money waiting to be picked up.America’s top export goods are oil, gasoline and other fuels, machinery, civilian aircraft and parts, computer chips, autos, scrap iron and steel, machine parts, soybeans, and medical technology. Top export services are intellectual property, transportation, and travel. Top import goods are computers, computer parts, computer chips, cell phones and equipment, screws and other fasteners, unrecorded audio media, auto parts, valued added to returned imports, exercise equipment, and windshield wipers and electric-light parts. Top import services are transportation, travel, and research and development.Taiwan long has been an important trading partner for Americans. These days it ranks in the top dozen. Total trade for the first eight months of last year was almost $55.8 billion. That was an increase of about 16 percent over the previous year. In 2018 (full year), the total of goods and services was almost $94.5 billion ($40.3 billion exports, $54.2 billion imports). Merchandise trade totaled $76.3 billion ($30.6 exports and $45.8 imports). That was a substantial increase over preceding years — $68.2 billion in 2017, $65.2 billion in 2016, and $66.7 billion in 2015.The best policy today is to minimize public conflict by empowering Taiwan. A U.S.–Taiwan FTA would increase would be good for both parties, increasing commerce between them. Taiwan already is one of the world’s freest economies; a free-trade agreement would encourage further liberalization in both countries.  
     
   Although a direct Chinese attack on the island seems unlikely — the PRC’s military is improving, but such an operation probably remains beyond its ability — it could employ other coercive measures. The U.S. could not easily justify intervening in a conflict. If it did intervene, it would almost certainly do so alone, without any of its allies, which would be unlikely to risk making Beijing a permanent enemy. However, Chinese aggression would likely trigger severe economic penalties from Asian and European states, which could not simply acquiesce to Chinese aggression.Indeed, the crackdown in Hong Kong rescued the reelection campaign of Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen. She seemed doomed by an economic slowdown, but opposition Kuomintang Party candidate Han Guo-yu was friendly to China. Given the dangerous tensions between Taiwan and the PRC, Han’s stance originally was seen as an advantage. Once Beijing demonstrated that autonomy depended on the CCP’s largely absent goodwill, Tsai became the defender of Taiwanese democracy and left Han far behind, especially among the young, who have an ever-diminishing identification with the mainland.For years Beijing appeared to accept this relational ambiguity while pressing for some form of reunification under the guise of “one country, two systems.” However, the CCP leadership has grown less patient and more insistent while the Taiwanese population has become more hostile and less quiescent. The PRC presumed that increasing economic ties would ultimately lead to unity; the example of Hong Kong was supposed to satisfy the concerns of the Taiwanese to maintain their political autonomy. However, that increased investment and trade have become more controversial in Taiwan precisely because they increase entanglement with the PRC, while the increasing CCP encroachments on Hong Kong’s special status have  destroyed any popular faith in the “one country, two systems” formula.America’s defection carried with it many other nations. Since then the mainland’s explosive economic growth has enabled the PRC to offer aid and trade to help peel away other governments that recognized the ROC. However, in addition to the 15 countries (counting the Vatican) that currently recognize the ROC, 57 others, including the United States, maintain various forms of semi-official “representation” offices.As the Cold War proceeded, however, Taipei found that it was disposable. In 1972, President Nixon famously flew to Beijing and met Mao. Relations warmed as Washington allowed the PRC to supplant Taiwan at the U.N. President Carter completed the process, officially recognizing Communist China as the one legitimate Chinese government, on January 1, 1979. Congress then approved the Taiwan Relations Act, which mandated a form of unofficial official relations, though Washington agreed to the PRC’s demand that the U.S. acknowledge that there was only “one China,” meaning the government in Beijing.Throughout the Cold War, the PRC and the ROC each claimed to be the only legitimate government of China. Mao’s cadres had the better practical case, since they controlled the mainland behemoth. Chiang had the stronger international backing, since the U.S. was in his corner, along with many of America’s allies. The ROC also held the United Nations membership and the Security Council seat.
Taiwan was taken as a spoil of war by Japan in 1895. It was returned to China only after Tokyo’s defeat in 1945. The island, then known as Formosa, became the last redoubt for ROC president Chiang Kai-shek when he retreated from the mainland after the triumph of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party in 1949.Relations between the America and China, the world’s two most important countries, are going badly. One of the greatest challenges, almost certainly more dangerous than the issue of trade, that has dominated President Trump’s approach to the PRC is the status of Taiwan. Washington should be wary of adding new political or military commitments to Taiwan. Instead, the U.S. should simultaneously advance economic and political objectives by negotiating a free-trade agreement (FTA) with Taipei.At the same time, the U.S. risks becoming ever more entangled in the controversy, with congressional passage of the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act. The legislation urges the president to support Taipei with arms transfers and official visits and to consult with Congress on strengthening bilateral economic ties. The bill also directs the administration to back Taiwan’s participation in international organizations and to encourage other countries to enhance their ties with what only 14 countries (plus the Vatican) now recognize as the Republic of China (ROC).A more serious source of conflict between the U.S. and the PRC is about to move to the fore: Taiwan. After the devastating defeat of the traditional ruling Kuomintang in the recent presidential election, the party chose a new chairman, Johnny Chiang, who dropped the KMT’s support for the “1992 consensus” that both Beijing and Taipei belonged to “one country.” He called on China to accept the island’s separate political identity. Beijing is more likely to increase its pressure on Taiwan.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

He rightly notes that this foot-dragging and bureaucratic morass serves an important purpose during peacetime — when it is more important for a test to produce reliable results than it is for said test to be available quickly — but, in Stapp’s words, “when public health officials need to contain a novel and highly contagious disease, speed matters more than perfection.” Certainly accuracy is crucial during an unexpected outbreak like COVID-19 — we would not want false positives unnecessarily quarantined, nor would we would false negatives infecting public spaces — but when a balance needs to be struck between speed and accuracy, the dearth of available tests in the United States at the moment makes it seem as though the former concern was not given adequate consideration by the FDA.How did the U.S. government only manage to produce a fraction as many testing kits as its peer countries?

No charge.As someone with who usually has a high threshold for offense at what others deem politically incorrect, I think the criticism of officials who persist in using the term “Chinese virus” is warranted. It aligns with a larger effort mounted by the medical profession to move away from language that is perceived as stigmatizing.In light of grave concerns about medical preparedness, death tolls, and economic upheaval, is worry over the term “Chinese virus” trivial? Congressman Ted Lieu (D., Calif.)   Such “In my own field of psychiatry, a related campaign to change language has been under way for decades. While none of our diagnoses bear the names of places or ethnic groups, the tendency to refer to people by their clinical condition has come under scrutiny. Thus, rather than call a patient “a schizophrenic” — as if that were his or her primary identity — it is better to call a patient “someone with schizophrenia.”The WHO’s actions were part of a quiet but persistent movement within the medical profession to purge clinical classification of stigmatizing language. One of the earliest efforts was to change the name of “Mongolism” or “Mongolian Idiocy” — an inborn intellectual disability. Writing in Since 2015, the WHO has recommended that new disease names should include descriptive terms, based on symptoms (e.g., respiratory disease, neurologic syndrome, or watery diarrhea). If scientists know how a disease manifests, whom it affects, or its severity or seasonality (e.g., progressive, juvenile, severe, or winter), that can be part of the name as well. If the pathogen that causes the disease is known, it should also be part of the disease name (e.g., coronavirus, influenza virus, or salmonella) — hence today’s “novel coronavirus,” or “SARS-CoV-2.”And while animals may not be the casualties that come to mind, in 2009 Egypt In the current coronavirus environment, physical and verbal But five years ago, the WHO called on experts, officials, and journalists to avoid names that include geographic locations. “[We’ve] seen certain disease names provoke a backlash against . . . ethnic communities, create unjustified barriers to travel, commerce, and trade, and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals,” said the assistant director-general for health security at WHO.The 
In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially The remedy is easy, critics say: Just call it coronavirus. They’re right. In fact, the profession has been trying to take identity out of diagnosis for a long time. Calling it the Chinese virus goes against a humanizing trend.But over the last few weeks, politicians and the media have taken heat for missteps in terminology, particularly since Trump seemed most strongly to insist upon calling it the “Chinese virus” in the wake of China’s “Yes, the first outbreak took place in <span class=""drop"">D</span>

Obviously it’s a lot sadder when a toddler dies in a car accident than when an elderly person with terminal cancer does. So we might want to measure the benefits of stopping COVID in terms of “quality-adjusted life years,” especially because the disease seems to fall heavily on the elderly and hardly at all on children.

An <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/study-coronavirus-outbreak-could-get-very-bad-and-last-a-very-long-time/"">Imperial College study</a> said that COVID could kill 2 million Americans in a do-nothing scenario, and even more if we couldn’t come up with enough ventilators for everyone who needed them, which we almost certainly couldn’t. We can reduce that number by half with mitigation efforts, and more if we suppress the virus more thoroughly. These estimates rely on strong assumptions that will prove wrong in some direction and to some extent. But I think it makes sense to think of this trade-off in terms of a million lives — a nice round number that you can increase or decrease mentally if you prefer a different assumption.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But hey.

I’m not sure it’s possible to do that with the information we have right now — we don’t really know how many people are asymptomatic, for example, and we’ll probably never know what would happen if we did absolutely nothing or took only minimal steps, since no country afflicted by this plague is trying this, uh, creative suggestion.</span>National ReviewFollow Us",0,A COVID Cost-Benefit Analysis

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.The Chinese Communists will win some headlines during this crisis, but ultimately they will not overcome their power-hungry, mercantilist nature and advance their claim to global leadership. Americans give because of who they are, while Chinese Communists give to take more back later. The world will see — and remember. And they are not alone. Most of their democratic allies favor humanitarian aid over defense spending — often to a fault — but this preference makes them uniquely able and willing to help other countries respond to pandemics.Americans already lead the world in responding to global health crises because of some of their most foundational beliefs. Nearly 200 years ago, Alexis de Tocqueville marveled at how universally Americans believed in the “principle of interest rightly understood,” explaining how “an enlightened regard for themselves constantly prompts them to assist each other.” This principle makes Americans the most generous people in the world, giving Despite headlines to the contrary, the United States is helping other countries even as it battles the infection at home. The administration’s response may have been clumsy at times, but the U.S. is doing a lot of good: Congress has already passed, and President Trump has already signed, $1.3 billion in foreign aid to help other countries fight COVID-19, and the Asian Development Bank, whose biggest stakeholder is the United States, is helping developing countries with another $6.5 billion. This is but a part of the over $90 billion that the United States has spent on global health since 2009.Overall, China has returned to Europe about as much medical equipment as it received, taking credit for in effect receiving supplies from northern and central Europe and delivering them later to southern Europe — but unlike the European donors, the Chinese aren’t doing it for free. Chinese Communists are boasting about their magnanimity and are letting Germany and the European Union take the blame for shortages across Europe that are largely due to Chinese hoarding. This is not philanthropy; this is mercantilism.
The most remarkable case, however, is in Italy, where China’s ostentatious delivery of supplies and doctors has caused much consternation among Americans who worry that the United States is losing its global leadership role. Media accounts often omitted that the supplies were bought and paid for by the Italians, when the most newsworthy element to the story is that China actually kept its commitment to deliver what it sold.Chinese propagandists also claim that China is leading the way in responding to the crisis internationally, which is patently false. China’s much-publicized gift of 1 million masks to Japan is a grand and magnificent gesture, albeit only one-third as grand as prior Japanese donations of nearly 3 million masks to China.China did not delay the disease’s spread, The main lesson the Chinese Communists seem to have drawn from the debacle is that the appearance of doing good is more important than actually doing it, and so far, media reactions are proving them right. In the past few weeks, the Chinese propaganda machine has gone into overdrive, praising China for buying time for the world to respond to the pandemic and for leading the global response to the coronavirus. Both claims are false, despite being widely bandied about in the media.China has learned a great deal in the past few years. After Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines in 2013, countries around the world sprang into action, sending food, money, and supplies to help. China joined in, initially offering . . . $200,000, a little more than half the $350,000 donation from the rock band Journey. After facing torrents of richly deserved scorn for its stinginess, the second-largest economy in world upped its ante to about $2 million, nearly matching the $2.7 million donation from geopolitical powerhouse Ikea.<span class=""drop"">A</span>

No charge.The Chinese government — a body singularly adept in the creation and dissemination of propaganda — knows that racial hang-ups in the United States are ripe for exploitation. The Chinese propaganda outlet Trump reminded Vega that the disease originated in China and that the Chinese are currently waging a massive disinformation campaign to blame the virus on the United States. The fact that Vega asked this question, and the endless hand-wringing in the media about real and hypothetical instances of “xenophobia,” put the warped priorities of many in the media on full display.  
     
   (“A lot of people say it’s racist” can reliably be read as “Cecilia Vega thinks it’s racist.”)“There are reports of dozens of incidents of bias against Chinese Americans in this country,” Vega pleaded. “Your own aide, Secretary Azar, says he does not use this term. He says that ethnicity does not cause the virus. Why do you keep using this? A lot of people say it’s racist.”Cecilia Vega of ABC News used the second question at a White House press conference to ask the president of the United States — amid a pandemic shutting down major cities, killing thousands globally, and grinding the economy to a halt — why he insisted on calling a virus that emanated from China the “Chinese virus.”We face an actual pandemic, of course, one that actually arose from China and that has actually killed thousands of people around the world.

In all of the pieces I read, however, authors do not accurately show their work to demonstrate the “increase” in violence against Asian Americans. They rely on the same handful of anecdotes — four or five incidents over the past two months that, while abhorrent and unacceptable, represent a vanishingly small number in a country of 327 million people. It’s almost certainly the case, of course, that some number of anti-Asian attacks have gone unreported — that’s the nature of these events, and it’s bound to be true that some victims have not disclosed incidents of violence — but we have no idea how large or small that number is. In the absence of such evidence, however, many in the media continue to run with the narrative that Americans are indiscriminately assaulting their Asian-American neighbors, which would continue unabated if not for the enlightened intervention of advocates in the media. The press corps betrays their rather low opinion of Americans when they presume that assaulting strangers in a fevered racial hysteria is just the sort of thing the American people do.Trump’s use of the term “Chinese virus” has drawn the ire of many in the media who feel he is stoking anti-Asian sentiment among the public.

Washington State legislators, for instance, authorized drawing $200 million from their surplus fund for added health-care spending and to help pay for looming unemployment claims. Georgia has taken $100 million from its surplus fund to finance the coronavirus battle, and Maryland legislators have authorized Governor Larry Hogan to use $50 million for the same battle. The problem is that prior to the crisis, states collectively had only about $70 billion in these funds—enough to run state government for just eight days, on average. A few find themselves in even worse shape.

If they do, it will be worth noting that we were all failed by those in authority at the start of this outbreak. But until then, as we wait for the widespread testing that will ultimately allow us to reopen America, each of us should ask what we can and must do to care for our neighbors. That doesn’t just mean tweeting; it means running errands for the infirm or overworked, giving generously to those suffering financially, and offering child care and meals to vulnerable families. Keeping in touch with our loved ones any way we can, as frequently as we can, will prevent our social muscles from atrophying until we’re once again free to see each other face to face.  
   America today is suffering from a similar poverty of kinship, compounded by the fear of poverty itself. Nearly a quarter of all Americans have now been told to stay at home. There will be no gatherings for weddings, no funerals for our loved ones. Our restaurants and bars face a modern-day Prohibition, with millions of Americans now out of work. We are united in a state of communal isolation tempered only by technology.  
   As for the Life Care Center, today it resembles something like a holding cell for the dozens of senior citizens living within its walls. Families are allowed to see their loved ones only through locked glass panes, isolated and lonely on the other side. Blue ribbons adorn the pine trees surrounding the center, in remembrance of the Many of America’s cities and states are restricting or attempting to restrict public activity in much the same way. “Open” signs have, virtually overnight, disappeared: Restaurants, schools, theaters, gyms, and other places where large groups gather in close proximity are closing from New York City to Los Angeles.

Twenty-five firefighters who had responded to medical calls at the facility were placed in quarantine, and six of their colleagues later followed suit. But it was all too little, too late: Nursing centers throughout the Seattle area began reporting cases of COVID-19. The virus soon spread all the way to North Carolina, where a resident who’d visited Life Care Center became the state’s first confirmed case.As priests moved through the Life Care Center on February 26, dabbing smudges of ash on foreheads for Ash Wednesday, the virus was sweeping through as well. Patients had been getting sick for more than a week at this point, perhaps even as long as a month. Anyone visiting Life Care could tell something was wrong. Loved ones were reaching out to the Seattle and King County Public Health Department demanding an investigation; according to an account in the County health officials It all began with patient zero. The 35-year-old had just returned to Seattle on January 15 from visiting family in Wuhan, China.

Advertisement<em>© 2019 by King Features Syndicate</em>Whatever path we take will be costly and have its downsides. All we can know with certainty is that the current path is untenable.Then, we could begin to return to normal with much less risk, even if vulnerable populations and metropolitan hot spots still require extraordinary precautions.This regimen would depend on innovation — cheaper, faster tests, etc. — but that is surely within our power with enough will and resources.The first priority should obviously be backstopping the hospital system and protecting front-line medical workers. But, as economists Paul Romer and Alan M. Garber argue, we need to widen out from there to create a system of population-wide testing and the distribution of protective gear to workers interacting with the public to protect against the spread, while allowing for ordinary work.We should focus on the production of tests, ventilators, masks, and other protective gear on an industrial scale. Whatever the government has to spend or do to get it done should happen — just as if we were on a wartime footing.Our aim should be to shift from the blunderbuss solution of mass shutdowns to rifle-shot remedies, on the model of what South Korea has done with its widespread testing (although it has much more favorable conditions as a smaller, more cohesive country with an outbreak centered on one church).The answer to our current situation doesn’t require downplaying COVID-19, or going about business as usual and hoping for the best. The advantage of the lockdowns is that they make every other public-policy option look cautious and inexpensive by comparison. What can be more radical than telling tens of millions of Americans to shelter in place?If the disease had been left unchecked, it would have exacted an enormous price, in lives of the infected, in the breakdown of the hospital system, in the follow-on effects on people ill with conditions that would have gone untreated. No matter how bad today’s lockdowns are, imagine if we decided to undertake them at a time when the U.S. already had a million cases and the health-care system was in deep crisis.And it’s important to remember that the disease itself is imposing an economic cost. It would have caused a recession regardless of government policy. Would New York City restaurants really be full if it weren’t for the Andrew Cuomo–ordered lockdown? Would people be eager to get on airplanes? To book a cruise? To see a Broadway show? To go to Disneyland?If that sentiment is understandable, it’d be foolish to give up on the lockdowns before they have much of a chance to, in the cliché of the hour, flatten the curve.No, this is not sustainable, nor will people stand for it except as a temporary expedient. President Donald Trump is already expressing impatience with his own guidance against gatherings of more than 10 people for the next 15 days.
The federal government can alleviate some of the damage, but even the biggest, best-designed stimulus bill is no substitute for shuttered storefronts and factories. And how many times can Washington pass $2 trillion bills?These are the top-line numbers of a vastation that will throw millions out of work, stress families and blight personal lives, destroy the dreams of small-business owners, and bankrupt industries. This is a tale of human misery, not just of declines in the stock market and in GDP.Goldman Sachs is forecasting a 24 percent drop in quarterly GDP. Morgan Stanley is anticipating a 30 percent decline.The nationwide coronavirus shutdowns over the past two weeks have ground parts of the country to a halt. We have probably never before in our history seen so much economic activity vaporize so quickly — within days or even hours. The Great Depression and the panics of the 19th century are the only possible analogues.<span class=""drop"">C</span>

   Nothing does.King Solomon, the story goes, asked his wise men (in the ancient world, they emphasized wisdom; people today emphasize knowledge) to make him a magic ring. This ring would lift up his spirits if he got depressed and bring him back down to earth if he got euphoric. The wise men returned with a ring in which the Hebrew words “gam zu ya’avor” were inscribed: “This, too, shall pass.” Keep in mind that this awful period will pass. The human psyche is programmed to think that whatever is happening now — happy or sad — will go on indefinitely.Don’t look to food for too much comfort. As it is, most people will be moving around far less than normally. When that is added to a lot of junk food, the results will not be pretty. It’s been reported that sales of cookies and chips have gone up significantly in the past few weeks. The last thing you want to do now is weaken your immune system. Eat as healthily as you can. Getting some exercise is also important. Going for a walk every day is a good place to start.Order online items. During this quarantine, Americans are purchasing more and more items through the Internet. Try to order from vendors other than Amazon as much as possible. The purpose is not to hurt Amazon; Amazon is a remarkable company. The purpose is to keep as many Internet vendors in business as possible. It takes only an additional minute or two to order from another site.Order as many meals as possible from local restaurants. Most Americans will get their food from supermarkets. If you can afford it — and I suspect most readers of this column can — try to get most of your meals from a local restaurant through takeout orders. We need to do everything possible to keep local restaurants in business.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>If you have kids at home — from as early as fifth grade through graduate school — watch PragerU videos with them. They are all just five minutes long, highly educational, and very entertaining. Professors from major universities of the Western world, four Pulitzer Prize winners, three former prime ministers, and some of the finest minds in the world offer these courses. There are 400 such videos. They will engender spirited discussion and take your mind off the virus and quarantine. They are all free, so I have no hesitation recommending something I am affiliated with.Decide to be happy. As Lincoln said, “We are as happy as we decide to be.” You owe it to those living under house arrest with you — in fact, you are morally obligated — to be as easy to live with as possible during this miserable time. Calibrating your mood now, when it’s tough, will set a great example for your family that could pay big dividends in the future. I could imagine your kids saying decades hence, “Remember how our parent(s) stayed upbeat during the coronavirus scare?” What a wonderful legacy that would be.Make sure to stay in touch via phone or video with anyone you know to be alone. For such people, social isolation is close to being in solitary confinement. After two weeks of you and them remaining asymptomatic, I would also suggest visiting such people or having them visit you. Being alone for weeks is likely to be much more hazardous to a person’s health than the relatively small possibility of contracting, let alone dying from, the new coronavirus.Instead, you can read, talk to friends, watch movies, learn a language, listen to music, start a journal, walk outside, garden, or engage in hobbies. Do that project you’ve never had time to get to. In short, don’t preoccupy yourself with the virus. My wife and I watched a James Bond movie a few nights ago, and I loved the total escape it provided. And I’m getting more work done on the third volume of my Torah commentary (Watch less news. Interview and opinion shows on TV, and talk-radio shows that add to one’s understanding of the situation, can be valuable.

If the state succeeds in slowing the spread of the virus, it could very well be due to its robust diagnostic capacities. Together with its tri-state peers, Connecticut has issued closures of nonessential businesses.Yesterday, Washington governor Jay Inslee ordered a mandatory, state-wide stay-at-home order, barring residents from going outside except for essential business, doctor’s appointments, and grocery shopping. While Washington’s restrictions are more draconian than those in New York or California, the state has had considerable success in slowing the spread of the virus.

In times of crisis, political expedience outweighs legal niceties. In the straits COVID-19 has put us in, no one is going to have heartburn over the fact that the president is stretching a statute to the breaking point (and beyond) to grant much needed assistance to strapped states. The only question is whether doing so will serve as a precedent for future major disaster declarations based on alleged health disasters that are not nearly as disastrous.Don’t get me wrong. I’m not complaining. These states need the help. With the Congress held hostage by ideological leftists, who are seeking drastic social change by extortion as the price of providing federal help to beleaguered states, businesses, and citizens, who can blame the president for extravagantly interpreting laws already on the books? Apparently, the alternative requires swallowing the likes of a payoff for Speaker Pelosi’s friends at the Kennedy Center ($35 million) and the National Endowment for the Arts ($300 million), a Post Office bail out ($11 billion in debt), a job-killing $15/hour national minimum wage, the Green New Deal wish-list, etc.any natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under this chapter to supplement the efforts and available resources of states, tribes, territories, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused thereby.Obviously, COVID-19 is a dire medical emergency, but it simply does not qualify as a “major disaster.” Sure enough, by the end of the weekend, at the urging of the relevant state officials, the president had declared major disasters existed in The president has floated the notion of triggering the act’s more potent declaration of a “major disaster.” Legally, that seems unlikely: The Stafford Act says such a declaration must be requested by the affected state(s), and its terms are confined to physical infrastructure damaged by natural catastrophes (e.g., hurricanes and earthquakes), not by pathogens that infect people but do not destroy structures. Yet, if states hard hit by COVID-19 were to make the request, and the president responded with additional tranches of federal assistance, how punctilious do we really think Americans would be about statutory construction?In my Well, that didn’t take long.National ReviewFollow Us",0,"Politics, Not Law (cont’d): President Trump Invokes ‘Major Disaster’ Power"

That's a low estimate–some suggestion $9 million. Some people are saying that slowing the pandemic isn't worth it. I'm going to do some crude math for those who need it.Further, we might not want to use “quality-adjusted life years,” which assume younger people’s lives are more valuable, at all. If you instead use the value of a “stastistical life,” you end up with far bigger benefits from controlling COVID, as Most of the numbers here aren’t too far off from the ones I presented yesterday in my own bare-bones “quality-adjusted life years” math, but I think there’s a big thing they’re missing: The costs here aren’t just lives lost. If we let COVID get out of control we’ll also have many more cases where people do not die but do fall severely ill, which involves a lot of misery and a lot of health-care costs. (There’s more on the other side of the ledger, too, such as the long-term consequences of letting workers’ human capital stagnate as they stay home from work, but I would guess the former types of problems are generally more severe than the latter types.)They then peg the costs of containment at $1 trillion to $4 trillion, leading to a conclusion that the cost per quality year of life gained ranges from $75,000 to $650,000: “somewhere between reasonably cost effective and clearly not a wise investment.” “Our calculations suggest that current strategies will be cost effective only if the predicted mortality rates are at the top of the predicted range and costs are at the bottom of the range — a combination of worst care / best case that is unlikely,” they add.. . .

For many schools, March and April are when they send out the bulk of acceptances or denials. Financial aid packages are sent out, too — setting up the options for how to pay. Traditionally, May 1 is “decision day,” the deadline for students to submit a deposit to hold their spot at a school for the following fall semester. But there’s a growing movement this year to shift the deadline back a month, to June 1, to give students and families more time.<em>Much of the <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/03/22/818722786/graduation-financial-aid-admissions-for-this-years-college-bound-the-future-is-i"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">college admissions process has just been thrown into confusion.</a></em>The AP College Board will run AP exams online this year, covering the material that most schools were able to In most school districts, the school year is about five-eighths complete. Most schools are expected to advance students to the next grade next fall.This means that for students in these states and cities, their final grades for the year were effectively set in early-to-mid-March when schools closed. When these students apply for college, will admissions officers look at their transcripts differently? Will there be a general sense that grades for 2020 should be evaluated differently, because the school year ended so abruptly, without the usual final exams?States like Kansas and Virginia announced that schools will not reopen this spring, North Carolina is closed until May 15, and California is closed indefinitely. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio says his city’s public schools may not reopen this year. It is possible that many of the nation’s children will not be back in school until either summer classes or next fall.Right now, many schools are doing their best, trying to assemble and implement an online and distance-learning curriculum that they never expected they would need for months at a time.<em>Traditional education of America’s children has come to a screeching halt. </em>“I don’t even want to think about the impact on the pension funds,” said Brad Williams, a veteran budget analyst and partner at Capitol Matrix Consulting. “We know that pensions were underfunded going into this, and…once you get behind, it’s hard to claw back, so we really need a bounce back in markets to avoid pretty dire circumstances.”At last count, the combined retirement liability for state workers and teachers topped $250 billion. And because the funds depend largely on investment earnings to keep up with pension checks, Wall Street’s rout will lead to bigger unfunded liabilities at CalPERS and CalSTRS.With the collapse in stock prices, the state’s public-employee pension systems — mainly California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System — are taking a beating.<em>Both public and private pension plans suddenly look way shakier with the sudden plummeting stock markets.</em>In response to the quickly evolving impacts of COVID-19 on the State’s finances, on March 20, 2020, the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting (the “Budget Director”) placed over $900 million of items of appropriation into reserve, which means that the Budget Director identified various appropriations which will now require the Budget Director’s approval before the appropriated amount may be expended . . .<em>State and local sales-tax revenue is plummeting right now.</em>But after that, there are plenty of follow-on problems that will need to be addressed — here are four that are getting little attention compared to the ongoing fights in Washington.Our first crisis is making sure our hospitals don’t get overwhelmed.

					© 2020 National Review				Our Capital Letter email newsletter delivers a weekly digest on finance, business, and economics from an NR sensibility.It will take luck and ingenuity to dodge a systemic financial disaster. Both now seem in short supply.And for some states, eight days would be a luxury.Even before any recession actually hits, states are tapping their reserves to pay for resources in the fight against Covid-19, meaning that they’ll have even less of a budget cushion should an economic downturn become severe. . . . The problem is that prior to the crisis, states collectively had only about $70 billion in these funds — enough to run state government for just eight days, on average.As Steven Malanga noted recently in On top of that, there is the question of the nation’s finances, both at the federal and state level. The appalling condition of the former is hardly a secret: Huge deficits and To believe that the country can go through this sort of economic turmoil (and the effect it will have on so many lives), let alone the fear and the pain that any pandemic will generate, without profound psychological and thus political consequences is, I think, delusional. And the longer that turmoil lasts, the greater those consequences will be. They are not just going to be confined to November. Indeed, they may be amplified by it. The increased possibility of victory by a Democratic Party that, even if fronted by Biden, is driven to the left by events as much as (or more than) the need to retain his party’s Sanders wing, is unlikely to give business reasons to invest in recovery. And if the Democrats win . . .
It’s a statement of the obvious, but the longer the shutdowns last, the greater the structural damage. The V-shaped recovery is, I suspect, already an illusion, but even something that resembles a very poorly drawn U is quickly disappearing beyond reach. This is not (necessarily) an argument for trying to drive the economy, however cautiously, back to the outskirts of normality (that’s a debate for another time) in the next few weeks, but it is a reminder that the destruction caused by this pause is going to take a long time to put right. To take an architectural metaphor further, conceivably, than it should go, a massive stimulus package may stop the roof caving in for now, but it won’t do much to shore up foundations that were not very strong in the first place.What’s more, even if the lockdowns are eased, a lot of people will be reluctant to travel too far or too much from home or the workplace. In the absence of a vaccine or an easily available and effective treatment, people will perceive COVID-19 as a menace for quite some time yet. The Florida beaches may have been crowded by spring breakers a week or so back, but in my Manhattan neighborhood, the bars were quieter, some restaurants had no customers, and (having a preemptive haircut) I was the only customer in the local barbershop. People were nervous, and they will continue to be nervous. Make of it what you will, but despite signs of revival in the Chinese economy, relatively few moviegoers have returned (so far) to the cinema.Take a look at consumer spending, some 70 percent of GDP. Even if all the furloughed and the fired could resume what they were doing (or, in the case of workers from home, go back to the office), many of them will have drained their savings or gone deeper into debt. Meanwhile a good portion of those who have kept their jobs will have learned that they are more vulnerable than they might previously have thought. For all the talk of pent-up demand, it’s hard to see depleted wallets and badly bruised confidence as the preconditions of a spending spree, even more so if consumers pay any attention to the longer-term fiscal implications, whether at the state or the federal level, of today’s emergency.Goldman’s economists are, however, anticipating that GDP will recover by (an again annualized) 12 per cent in the third quarter. But the damage inflicted on the economy is not going to be easily undone: Unemployment was expected to peak at 9 percent. Bad though that unemployment figure may be, my guess (and currently that is all that any forecast can be) is that it, along with hopes of a more or less V-shaped recovery, will turn out to be too optimistic. Even if the parts of the economy that have been braked or switched off were to start up again tomorrow, it would take a while for them to return to any approximation of business as usual.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

The program’s relevance to the global pandemic is left unaddressed.<em>Grant Program for “Sustainable Aviation Fuel”</em><strong>Environmental Regulations</strong>The renewal of Money Follows the Person deserves to be debated properly. It should not be smuggled into an emergency appropriations bill of this sort.The House Bill extends the Money Follows the Person (MFP) program in Medicaid. A darling of deinstitutionalization exponents in Congress, MFP is a federal program designed to incentivize states to move the elderly and persons with intellectual disabilities out of “institutions,” such as Intermediate Care Facilities (ICF) and nursing homes and into “community” settings, such as group homes. The program is controversial, because despite its presentation as a “voluntary” initiative, it incentivizes states to close “institutions” that those with the most profound disabilities rely upon through an <em>Reauthorization of Money Follows the Person</em><strong>Deinstitutionalization</strong>In a portion of the bill addressing the contingency protocols for the administration of the 2020 U.S. Census, the House bill includes a section on institutions of higher learning. The bill proscribes colleges and universities from disclosing “any information to the Bureau on the immigration or citizenship status of any individual” enrolled there. What this has to do with the coronavirus crisis, no one knows.<em>Prohibiting Institutions of Higher Learning from Disclosing the Immigration Status of Students</em><strong>Immigration</strong>The Help America Vote Act was signed by President Bush in 2002. It helped to modernize the nation’s voting infrastructure by calling for the creation of computerized voter-registration rolls at the state level, constructing federal accessibility guidelines to accommodate voters with disabilities, and setting up the Electoral Assistance Commission to certify state voting systems. Pelosi’s coronavirus-relief bill, which ostensibly is intended to provide “relief” to businesses and individuals affected, directly or otherwise, by the coronavirus, inexplicably seeks to amend the Help America Vote Act, and, in so doing, upend state election protocols by requiring states to allow same-day voter registration. Twenty-nine states do not allow such registration. Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia do. It is not clear that this divide need be resolved at all, much less that it ought to be resolved at the federal level. And it is completely unclear why such a provision has any place in an emergency economic-stimulus package.<em>Amending the Help America Vote Act to Require States to Accommodate Same-Day Registrants</em>  
   <strong>Requiring States to Allow Same-Day Voter Registration</strong>  
   All companies that receive federal aid related to COVID-19 would be required, under the House proposal, to appoint at least one-third of their board members through “a one-employee-one-vote election process.” In other words, if companies accept aid from the federal government at a moment when, because of a completely unforeseeable global catastrophe, demand has cratered in response to a lethal pandemic, the House bill would force them to completely upend their boards of directors to no conceivable end other than the fulfillment of a longstanding progressive wish.<em>Aid Recipients Must Allow Labor to Appoint One-Third of Corporate Board Members </em><strong>Restructuring Corporate Boards</strong>What the number of Hispanics in a given aid recipient’s supply chain or the presence of “inclusion initiatives” have to do with propping up the pandemic-battered economy remains unclear.<em>All</em>All publicly traded corporations receiving federal aid would, under the Pelosi proposal, be required to file quarterly disclosures to the SEC detailing their demographic “composition, including data on diversity (including racial and gender composition) and any policies and audits related to diversity.”<em>Diversity Reporting Requirements for Businesses Receiving Federal Aid</em>This section obliges the head of each federal department or agency to “develop and implement standards and procedures to ensure, to the maximum extent possible as permitted by law, the use of minority banks and minority credit unions to serve the financial needs of each such department or agency.” It would also require all federal departments and agencies to submit an annual report to Congress detailing the extent of their use of financial institutions owned by racial minorities and women. Whatever the merits of this idea, it, like the above proposed changes to Section 308 of FIRREA, does not belong in a coronavirus-relief package.<em>Establishment of a “Minority Bank Deposit Program,” Federal Diversity Reporting Requirements</em>
Section 308 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 instructs the Treasury secretary to consult with the chairman of the FDIC’s board of directors to preserve the “number of minority depository institutions” owned by “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.” That vague category has, according to <em>Amending FIRREA to Protect Financial Institutions Operated by Women</em><strong>Diversity Initiatives</strong><strong>*    *    *</strong>Pelosi and her caucus apparently took note, as the Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D., S.C.) told fellow his fellow House Democrats last week that COVID-19, which has killed more than 17,000 people around the world and is threatening to leave the country in financial ruin, represented a “<span class=""drop"">T</span>

Then he was almost eclipsed by crushing losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, only to be rescued by a landslide victory in South Carolina. He of all people knows that if we look at how the nomination battle has gone so far, nothing is really over until it’s over.</span><span style=""color: #101010;"">Of course, much has changed since 1940, and conventions are no longer such free-wheeling affairs as they were then. But Democrats know that politics has again become fluid and surprising in recent years — witness the strength of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump in their respective parties.</span><span style=""color: #101010;"">Then the Nazi blitzkrieg struck. Adolf Hitler overran the Low Countries and France in May and June of 1940. The French signed an armistice on June 22, the day Willkie arrived in Philadelphia for the Republican convention. The international crisis and how the party should respond to it dominated delegate deliberations. After a series of carefully orchestrated “spontaneous” demonstrations of delegate support, Willkie was nominated on the sixth ballot. His campaign stumbled in the fall and he lost 55 percent to 45 percent to incumbent Franklin Roosevelt. But he achieved something no one had thought possible by even getting nominated.</span><span style=""color: #101010;"">And strange things happen in politics. In 1940, businessman Wendell Willkie didn’t enter a single primary, his supporters pinning their hopes on a receptive audience of delegates at the Republican convention. Skeptic Alice Roosevelt Longworth sneered that his support came “from the grass roots of 10,000 country clubs.”</span><span style=""color: #202124;"">Of course, the mathematics of how Governor Cuomo could be drafted to become the Democratic nominee are daunting. He has zero delegates and no campaign and can’t be seen as being distracted by politics during a crisis. But Emily Zanotti of <i>The Daily Wire</i> says that if states continue to postpone or cancel upcoming primaries, a window of opportunity could be there: “Cuomo </span><span style=""color: #202124;"">Liberal pundits aren’t even trying to defend Biden’s recent media performances. Alex Wagner, a former MSNBC anchor and current co-host of Showtime’s political-magazine show <i>The Circus</i>, wrote a piece this week for <i>The Atlantic</i> magazine called: “Stay Alive, Joe Biden: Democrats need little from the front-runner beyond his corporeal presence.” She discussed Biden’s current status as if he barely existed: “Biden was never really convincing anyone on the stump — his political power at this point is an idea, held collectively, about how to defeat Trump.”</span><span style=""color: #202124;"">A Tuesday appearance went no better, even though it was with a friendly liberal group of interviewers from ABC’s <i>The View</i>. “We have to take care of the cure. That will make the problem worse no matter what — no matter what,” Biden asserted to universal head scratching. He attempted to pick up on Cuomo’s assertion that lives must be the absolute priority in the crisis — but with limited success: </span><span style=""color: #202124;"">Biden stumbled, slurred his words, misnamed one of the nation’s governors, lost his train of thought, and had to desperately <a href=""https://issuesinsights.com/2020/03/23/joe-bidens-incredibly-uninspiring-coronavirus-address/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">signal to staff for help</a> while he was on camera. </span><span style=""color: #202124;"">In his first outing on Monday, Biden looked as he were lost somewhere on the set of <i>Wayne’s World</i>, the 1990s comedy movie that pretended it was a public-access cable show broadcast from a basement.</span><span style=""color: #202124;"">In an attempt to remain relevant, Biden’s campaign team hastily built a TV studio in the basement of his Wilmington, Del., home and began streaming daily appearances by him from it this week. They have not gone well. </span><span style=""color: #202124;"">Indeed, Biden seemed to disappear when the virus began dominating the news cycle early in March. Biden’s media presence “abruptly shriveled,” writes Kalev Leetaru, a senior fellow at the George Washington University Center for Cyber &amp; Homeland Security. In contrast, <a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/03/24/cuomo_rises_as_trump_falls_in_covid-19_coverage_142742.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">daily mentions</a> of Cuomo as of last Sunday “accounted for 1.4 percent of online news coverage compared with 2.9 percent for Trump.”</span><span style=""color: #202124;"">Democrats are increasingly worried that Joe Biden will have trouble being relevant and compelling in the long four months between now and when he is nominated in July. Lloyd Constantine, who was a senior policy adviser to New York governor Eliot Spitzer from 2007 to 2008, <a href=""https://lloydconstantine.com/2020/03/24/hl-98-a-draft-cuomo-movement-at-the-democratic-convention-seems-inevitable/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">puts it bluntly</a>: “Biden is a melting ice cube. Those of us who have closely watched as time ravaged the once sharp or even brilliant minds of loved ones and colleagues, recognize what is happening to the good soldier Joe.”</span><span style=""color: #202124;"">Fueled by favorable national publicity that governors rarely get, Cuomo has quickly become the standard-bearer for liberals who don’t want to quickly open up parts the economy at the same time we combat the coronavirus. This Tuesday, the governor <a href=""https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1242479407031296000"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>: “We are not willing to sacrifice 1-2% of New Yorkers. That’s not who we are. We will fight to save every life we can. I am not giving up.” Last weekend, Cuomo told reporters he might go into Manhattan himself to yell “You are wrong” at people defying his lockdown.</span><span style=""color: #202124;"">Charles Pierce, the politics blogger for <i>Esquire</i> magazine, wrote a piece headlined “With Two Words, Andrew Cuomo Established Himself as the Leader This Country Needs Now.” He <a href=""https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a31814842/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-press-conference-new-york-lockdown/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">enthused</a> that Cuomo’s news conference last Friday “essentially (shutting) down the economy of his state . . . was a master class in leveling with the public.” </span><span style=""color: #202124;"">Some Democrats are openly talking up New York governor Andrew Cuomo, whose profile has soared during the crisis, as a Biden stand-in. Yesterday, a Draft Cuomo 2020 account on Twitter announced that “Times have changed &amp; we need Gov. Cuomo to be the nominee. Our next POTUS must be one w/an ability to lead thru this crisis.”</span><span style=""color: #202124;""><span class=""drop"">D</span><span class=""small_caps"">emocrats</span> are <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/politics/democratic-convention-milwaukee-coronavirus.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">publicly talking</a> about “contingency options” for their July convention in Milwaukee in case the coronavirus persists in being a public-health threat. But privately, some are also talking about needing a Plan B if Joe Biden, their nominee apparent, continues to flounder.</span>

No charge.I’d advise against getting carried away with this study in the meantime, but do keep your fingers crossed.Kucharski goes on to note that other sources of data on asymptomatic infections suggest far lower rates than the study posits. But to know for sure how many folks have had COVID-19 without knowing it, we need to randomly select lots of people and give them special “serology” tests that detect antibodies.

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.<em>© 2020 Tribune Content Agency, LLC</em>One of my priors is the idea that our political parties are overdue for a major transformation. The coalitions that constitute them are unstable and combustible. The ideas that once bound them together are frayed. This crisis will put even more strain on these already-feeble institutions, as politicians are dragged out of their comfort zones. It’s too soon to tell if this assessment will be confirmed, but I’d take bets that after this is all over, political scientists, like so many others, will be writing about B.C. and A.C. — before coronavirus and after.This pandemic will no doubt have a similarly long tail. The foundation of the property laws of Anglosphere nations was a response to the crisis of the Plague. (Historian Norman Cantor writes: “A barrister of 1350 deep-frozen and thawed out today would need only a six-month refresher course at a first-rate American law school to practice property or real estate law today.”)Tax withholding was invented to collect revenue during World War II. The imperial presidency, with its vast retinue of executive-branch officials answerable directly to the president, was created to give Franklin D. Roosevelt more power to fight the Great Depression.Perhaps oddly, I find myself wondering — and worrying — about Stage 4. How will things look when this is all over? What will be the new normal? Will the handshake ever return? What emergency measures now will be our everyday reality years from now?Other responses are still in the early stages, and big questions will need to be addressed, from how we should deploy the Defense Production Act to how to reconcile our federalist structure with public-health crises.What Stage 3 of the coronavirus crisis will look like remains murky. Andrew Yang’s quest for universal cash payments to Americans seemed quixotic just weeks ago. Now it looks like the bedrock of a new policy agenda. The traditional Republican resistance to interference in corporate decision-making is being worn away by the hour, and once swept aside it seems unlikely to return in nearly as robust a form. A new consensus may be quickly forming that government should have a much bigger say in how supply chains are structured, regardless of the corporate bottom line. It’s almost certain that the U.S. pharmaceutical industry’s dependence on China for basic medicinal ingredients will not survive this pandemic.This isn’t to say that both sides don’t try their best to deal with emergencies. But just as the stockpile of masks and ventilators is not adequate for the sudden demand, the same holds for the storehouse of policies we could put into effect right now. Or, to be more fair to the wonks who warned about some of these problems, there’s a lag time in getting new and better policies into production.Sometimes we get stuck in Stage 2. Shortly after 9/11, Senator Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) bowed to Democratic form when he wrote an op-ed for the Just because these policies are priors doesn’t mean they are necessarily ill-suited to the moment. For instance, canceling some student debt makes more sense now than before, and a major rethinking of our economic entanglement with China seems acutely overdue. But this has more to do with serendipity than critical thinking.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>For many Republicans, the booming economy was the perfect time to push for tax cuts, immigration restrictions (including a border wall), a new Cold War orientation toward China, and a declaration of war on the media for being mean to the president. And lo and behold, as the coronavirus crisis shaped up, they too believed their ideas were all the more justified.For many Democrats, the roaring economy of eight weeks ago was the perfect time to push for canceling student debt, establishing a $15-per-hour minimum wage, implementing Medicare for All, etc. A runaway pandemic and the start of a massive shutdown of the economy only made it more obvious that these “priors” were absolutely necessary.Politicians and policymakers are taking the threat seriously, but, lacking contingency plans and the mental bandwidth to deal with all of the challenges that are arising, they’ve been falling back on what they already believe to be true. Stage 2 is the “COVID-19 confirms my priors” period.Now we’re transitioning, in fits and starts, from Stage 2 to Stage 3.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.If government at all levels and private citizens take these steps immediately, it can help reduce the tragedy for all of us that will inevitably occur if we allow the seriously mentally ill to go untreated.The seriously mentally ill can become infected by viruses just like everyone else, and they may have lost touch with reality or any social network that can help them address the virus, or they may be afraid of doctors. When they tell someone about symptoms, the symptoms are often written off as figments of their imagination. If it’s coronavirus, such write-offs could be dangerous, and could lead to further spreading of the disease. So everyone should pay attention. And Instead of ending visitations by friends and families in jails and psychiatric hospitals, states should arrange safe ways to conduct them, for example by requiring temperature checks and handwashing before visitors enter facilities and setting up visitation tables that maintain social-isolation distances. Officials should also expand e-visitation options, including Skype, Facetime, Facebook, and closed-circuit video. States should also waive all fees and unnecessary limits on phone calls from or to jails, prisons, and psychiatric hospitals so that families can maintain contact in these difficult times. To counteract the shortage of psychiatrists, and what is likely to be a greater demand for them, states that haven’t given prescribing privileges to psychiatric nurse practitioners and properly trained psychologists should immediately do so. States should also make it easier for pharmacies to make deliveries, perhaps by contracting with Uber, Lyft, or food-delivery services. The federal government has made telemedicine easier to use, and states should make use of that as well. In addition, states should hire and mobilize students from shuttered social-work schools to look in on the seriously ill, reassure them, and connect them to food and services as needed.States should resist the temptation, which we are already seeing, to divert mental-health resources away from programs for the seriously mentally ill, who may become homeless, arrested, violent, or incarcerated without treatment, to programs that address coronavirus-driven anxiety and sadness among the otherwise healthy public. Anxiety and sadness are quite understandable, of course, but they are normal reactions to a crisis, not mental illnesses. Social networks can often address them by phone. Complaints about anxiety and sadness should be carefully triaged, and only if they are long-lasting and severe should mental-health workers be taken off assignment with the seriously mentally ill to address them.
States and localities also need to take action. State Medicaid directors should immediately apply for “1115 waivers,” which would allow the use of Medicaid funds to support state psychiatric hospitals. The federal government should instantly approve the waivers.The federal government is currently considering giving hotel operators a cash bailout with no strings attached. Instead, the government should rent rooms from hotel chains to house the homeless, many of whom suffer from serious mental illness. This scheme, which is already being tried in California, will help stop homelessness, temper the spread of coronavirus by enabling the homeless to self-isolate, and provide income for hotels. Police and mental-health departments should make sure the hotels are properly patrolled and residents are provided on-site services. Hotels could decline to lease the rooms to the government, but by doing so, they would forfeit their eligibility for bailout funds.People with serious mental illness often need medications to keep them from becoming psychotic and delusional. To ensure that this key connection goes unbroken, the federal government should issue emergency orders requiring all psychiatric prescriptions to be written and filled for 90 days, rather than just 30 days. This may require amending Medicaid, Medicare, or insurance regulations, but it will reduce the need to travel for refills (or even eliminate it, if the patient uses a mail-order pharmacy, which requires a prescription of 90 days). Finally, the federal government should take a close look at the supply chain for psychoactive medications so any potential global-supply-line interruptions can be addressed while there is still time.Most parents of the seriously mentally ill would love to have their children at home, but when the symptoms of the illness don’t prevent that, financial constraints often do. If a parent provides housing for a mentally ill loved one, he or she gets penalized: The child’s Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability check is reduced by one-third, making it harder to contribute to the family’s food, clothing, and household expenses. The federal government should abolish this one-third-reduction rule during the pandemic, and preferably permanently, to let parents reduce the demands their children place on already overextended social services. In fact, while our lawmakers are increasing unemployment benefits and making them easier to access, they should also increase the amount of disability payments, because many social services that people with mental illness rely on, such as transportation, have shut down.First of all, on the federal level, the government should swiftly suspend Medicaid’s IMD (Institutes for Mental Disease) exclusion and its prison exclusion. Those provisions prevent states from using Medicaid funds to help seriously mentally ill adults who are in psychiatric hospitals and jails, on the grounds that they should be the state’s responsibility. These provisions cause states to empty psychiatric beds and withhold treatment from the incarcerated. This means that the seriously mentally ill who contract coronavirus will be sent to already overcrowded emergency rooms that are ill-equipped to serve them, instead of to specially equipped psychiatric hospitals. The prohibitions on using Medicaid for the incarcerated and hospitalized mentally ill should be waived during the pandemic so that they can be treated appropriately.<span class=""drop"">W</span>

He said that unit is full too, and that on Monday, doctors had to discharge ICU patients to make room for five patients with worsening conditions.Elsewhere in Georgia, we can find more specifics about Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in a television interview with the city’s CBS affiliate Tuesday afternoon that the city’s hospitals are at capacity. But there are a lot of corners of the United States where the coronavirus outbreak is starting to hit smaller cities, with fewer hospitals, beds, intensive-care units, and ventilators.You are hearing a great deal about rapid increases in the number of coronavirus cases in New York, Seattle, and Los Angeles, and for good reason.

COVID-19 is called the Maybe they are right, but then again, Taleb became famous precisely because he understood that the masters of the universe on Wall Street were almost entirely IYIs, too.I think a great many Americans, sitting in the giant swathes of the country where coronavirus is nowhere to be found, are wondering if it’s all a lot of hysteria from the intellectual-yet-idiot class. Trump obviously senses this suspicion is out there. He’s hearing from people who wonder why you can’t hire a crew to lay a flagstone patio, as if that were a major vector of disease transmission. And he’s getting nervous about the projections of Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street institutions that 20 or 30 percent unemployment is in our near future, an economic reckoning the likes of which we’ve never seen.  
     
   By the time most people tuned in, lockdown was the urgent conventional wisdom, even though it is a form of extreme travel restriction. New explainers have been born to map out incubation periods, asymptomatic spreaders, and how to flatten the curve. Instead of anti-racism, epidemiology is the order of the day. And now people who opted not to take AP calculus their senior year of high school are plotting fatality rates. By a process of simple mathematical extrapolation, unconnected to how humans actually socialize with one another, extravagant projections have been made that millions will die.But I don’t think most people in America were paying much attention until reported numbers of cases started clustering in Seattle and Westchester, N.Y., and Italy decided to put some northern regions, and eventually its entire country, into a lockdown. Trump was still, at this point, saying that the virus would go away on its own, that it was under control, that it would not be a problem in America. He resisted letting infected patients off a cruise ship, seemingly to keep the overall numbers down. And then, almost overnight, the media conventional wisdom flipped. Taken together, these were my IYIs. And as I saw them treating the coronavirus the way they treat every subject, from the distribution of income to the distribution of Oscars awards, my sense was that it would probably be very serious indeed. Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea all took serious and dramatic measures, including limits on entry, to contain the virus.At this same time, the U.S. media was converging on the opinion that the novel coronavirus was <span>NOW WATCH: </span>I was most inspired by Chinese lawyer Chen Quishi’s For me, it happened in the last week of January, in the days after Wuhan went into lockdown.

The question is: When did you decide the “clerks” were screwing up this story and its meaning?We all feel this class exists. It is the most prominent voice in the culture, and we can almost hear it speaking to us from within our own faults. Some of us acknowledge the presence of this voice in our culture and in our own heads when we jokingly warn people that what we are about to say might be “problematic.” Many of us also feel that this kind of faux expert is almost always wrong, that these ‘clerks’ are an anti-compass, and whatever they say is true north must almost certainly be due south.<span class=""drop"">I</span>

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.Unfortunately, it just started snowing again.And here beside the Danube, we’re no longer waiting for the coronavirus in a bittersweet mood of Central European pessimism. We’re waiting for Professor Gupta’s test results like cockeyed optimists.Millions of people already feel luckier. Among them, Lucky Boris, who’s been handed an alternative to trudging into a socialist prison (if he’s prepared to take it), and Lucky Trump, who’s been given the justification he needs to close down the shutdown.If Professor Gupta’s work survives testing and, presumably, some pushback by the scientists at Imperial College, it will be a great and welcome achievement. It would mean that far fewer people are now at risk of a painful illness and death, that the balance of advantage between mitigation and suppression has now changed decisively in favor of the former, and that the destructive policy of closing down the economy to fight the coronavirus at recurring intervals can now be reversed or at the very least put on hold. As That approach would work more easily and surely, however, if “herd immunity” were more advanced in Britain, so that fewer people would be at risk of catching the illness and therefore fearful about it. That possibility has just been delivered by the second bolt from the blue, hurled, oddly enough, by the “Pink’ un.” The That’s not to dismiss the fates of human beings with a claim on us, merely to refine what is at stake. If the main aim of policy is to prevent those deaths from occurring all at the same time and overwhelming the health system, then — yes — it makes sense to adopt suppression. But if the main aim is to save their lives while avoiding an economic dislocation that would put many more lives at risk too, then that might be better accomplished by Smith’s policy of weaponized mitigation. His policy would combine paying the elderly to self-quarantine for a period while organizing industry and the voluntary services to equip hospitals with more beds and better medical technology in real time. And the latter is already happening throughout the English-speaking world.Even if the Italian data showed no bias, however, a third factor must be taken into account: namely, the annual death rate in the U.K. In 2018, one full year before COVID-19 was heard of, 541,000 people died in England and Wales, most of them older and less healthy people. That’s almost the exact prediction in the IC report of how many people would die if nothing was done. Are the 510,000 deaths in addition to the annual total? Apparently not. They will be part of the total. Naturally, no one now knows how large a part, since the deaths are hypothetical and the deceased still alive. But since those Brits who died in earlier years are similar in relevant respects to the great majority of Italians who died The lesser bolt is that, as we noticed earlier, researchers have only lately begun to point out that the Italian statistics may greatly exaggerate those deaths caused Amazingly enough, two bolts have suddenly appeared from the blue.If we could solve the medical flaw in this strategy — and that might be possible: read on — it would still face a more obstructive flaw. Governments have already committed themselves and their prestige to a bold (if mistaken) policy and invested immense amounts of political capital in it. It’s hard enough to change their minds before they’ve made such a commitment; it’s nigh impossible to do the same when they’ve bet the house on a single number in roulette. Okay, events will force a retreat to mitigation or something like it eventually. But it would require a bolt from the blue to get them to change now.The medical advantage is that it leads to a rapid spread of the virus and to herd immunity, “leading to an eventual rapid decline in case numbers and transmission dropping to low levels.” Unfortunately, in the meantime, under assumptions about its transmission to vulnerable groups (because of the likely degree of contact despite encouragement of social distancing) and the number of available critical-care hospital beds, it overwhelms health services and causes many deaths.Recall, this strategy consists of socially distancing only those who fit in the category of being particularly vulnerable to the virus, and quarantining those with the infection and those living in the same households. If that were done, it would cause some economic dislocation — e.g., for the travel and tourism industries — but it would allow most everyone else to get on with life as normal, albeit while practicing good hygiene. That is the economic and social advantage of mitigation.What he has in mind is a weaponized version of the mitigation strategy.It offers only a little solace that Boris is doing this reluctantly. It is still leading to the deliberate economic ruin of the country. President Trump sees the same thing and so proposes ending or avoiding a shutdown, but without a plausible way of dealing with the threat of the coronavirus in the longer term. There is a basic flaw to this approach. As Peter Smith writes: “The policies being adopted by governments are not tenable. They will bring about unquantifiable and crippling economic and social (and quite possibly serious health) consequences. Make no mistake, governments will be forced to reverse course . . . and adopt a different strategy.”One result is that public opinion has demanded — and governments have yielded to — the imposition of lockdowns that go much farther than the IC report proposed. The report was, for instance, ambivalent-leaning-to-hostile with respect to school closures. They would not reduce transmission of the virus between children, since they would still be mixing outside; if they had been infected, they might transmit the virus to vulnerable grandparents given the task of looking after them by harassed parents; and those parents working in the health sector and emergency sectors, now greatly needed to deal with higher patient loads, would be kept at home. But governments all over Europe — except, to its credit, the Dutch government — have now closed schools in response to public pressure, even though the ministers in them will tell you privately they think this is a bad idea with likely bad consequences. Boris Johnson’s Tory government has gone to extreme lengths in this regard, literally imprisoning people in their homes, with only an hour or so for exercise or shopping every day.Once the report was released, however, all restraints of practicality were released too. A mass public pandemic of panic took over. The merits of suppression versus mitigation seem to me to lie narrowly on the mitigation side of the argument. But its great failing is that allowing a virus to spread, albeit to sections of the population resistant to it (while protecting the vulnerable), is a very hard sell. That failing was magnified by media that scented government incompetence in the mythical U-turn (a reversal denied by the IC chairman) and set off to prove it. And that press campaign was made as toxic as the coronavirus by the fact that large numbers of pundits, including some conservatives, are in the grip of a wildly irrational “Boris Derangement Syndrome” that leads them to believe the most exaggerated (albeit contradictory) charges against him — “He’s a fascist who wants to control everyone.” / “He’s a libertarian who won’t impose the necessary controls on people.” (Much the same syndrome can be seen in the United States; indeed, some say it was invented there.)• Great depression or the breakdown of the nation’s health service? It’s not an easy choice, and to be fair to the scientists, they recognized this in the report, acknowledging both that there were crucial social and economic aspects of the crisis and that they could advise only on its medical aspects.• At the same time, a “lockdown,” partial or total, under suppression would gravely damage the economy, perhaps reducing the gross domestic product by a fifth to a third and creating mass unemployment. It would also halt the gradual expansion of “herd immunity,” which under mitigation would have meant that most people would have suffered the mild symptoms of a weakening virus, thereby becoming immune, while the elderly and at-risk groups were protected by quarantine measures reserved for them until the virus had been more or less eradicated. • Without a policy of suppression — i.e., immediately halting the spread of the virus by quarantining the population — the National Health Service would be overwhelmed, as in Italy. But the virus would remain in the population and resume spreading when quarantine was eased. There would be a second upsurge of infections and deaths in the fall, as has happened in earlier epidemics and may now be happening in China. And so a second lockdown. Or third.• The report itself was not a departure from previous government policy — the “U-turn” much touted in the media — but the evolution of policy that was a response in real time to the dimensions of the threat posed by the virus. What led the scientists to propose a move from mitigation to suppression was data from Italy showing numbers of infected people so high that the hospitals were overwhelmed.• The IC report itself is a balanced and flexible document. Though its authors chose a policy of “suppression” over “mitigation,” that was a matter of emphasis rather than of a strict division. Most of the practical policies to tackle the pandemic — case isolation, voluntary home quarantine, social distancing of the elderly, social distancing of the entire population, closure of schools and universities — are proposed under both headings but in different combinations, timescales, and so on.Their report, though not without its technicalities, is closely argued and readable. My advice is to read it Let’s look at a slightly more average case. The U.K. has 8,164 infections and 423 deaths. It has far fewer infection cases than Germany does and three times the number of deaths. And in the report of the Imperial College scientists — the one that underpins the policy of the British government — their estimate is that the coronavirus could lead to the deaths of between 20,000 and 500,000 people, depending on whether nothing is done or a quite draconian “lockdown” is imposed. And Boris Johnson has just done the latter. (Their estimate for the U.S. is between 500,000 and 2,200,000 deaths.) Reports in the past few days, moreover, suggest that over the weekend the Italian curve “peaked” and should now gradually decline until it dissipates entirely. That may take some time, and I leave it to the epidemiologists and statisticians to guess where both will end up. At this “peak point,” however, the Italian figures are 69,176 infected and 6,820 deaths, while Germany at an earlier point on the curve is looking at 31,260 infected and 156 deaths. These two countries point to quite different estimates of final fatalities.
And, indeed, in an Italian study of those who died, only three patients (0.8 per cent) had no pre-existing health condition, 99 percent had at least one preexisting condition, half had three, and the average of all was 79.6 years. Those figures give some indication of the difference between dyingRecording the numbers of those who die with Coronavirus will inflate the CFR as opposed to those that died from Coronavirus, which will reduce the CFR.In Italy, all those who die in hospitals with Coronavirus will be included in the death numbers. In the The decisive factor seems to be the different ways in which statistics of patients who die from the virus are recorded. When this is investigated, Italy’s figures look unduly high not only against Germany’s but also against those of most other countries listed above. A thorough examination of this appears in “Why, for instance, are the figures for deaths in Italy and Germany so much at variance when their figures for infections differ only moderately? The latter can be seen as different points on the same curve; the former need some additional explanation. What might that be? Are Germany’s health services superior to Italy’s? Given German efficiency, that’s not an unreasonable guess. But the experts seem to agree that health services in Lombardy, where the infection took hold, are among the best in Europe. Quite simply, good health services were swamped by the number of infected Italians needing scarce and costly treatments. Are border controls tougher in Germany? No. Before the spread of COVID-19 took serious hold and prompted caution, the two countries had the same EU open borders penetrated by the same migrants. Do age differences explain some of the divergence between the two death rates? That’s more complicated. Germany and Italy both have older populations hovering around a median age of 46. Germany is very slightly older, but the Italian population is less healthy — it smokes more heavily and is more resistant to antibiotics. Additionally, the population of those Germans infected by coronavirusDo these various figures justify the prevailing broad narrative, from both officialdom and the media, that unless we all adopt a total lockdown as soon as possible, all the above countries are doomed to follow the Italian path to mass infections overwhelming health services and producing hundreds of thousands of needless deaths? I don’t think this narrative can be dismissed lightly, but it should be examined skeptically, because there are some distinct oddities in the statistics on which it’s based.Consider now the same figures for Western Europe: Italy, 59,138/5,476; Spain, 33,089/2,206; Germany, 26,220/111; France 16,720/674; Switzerland, 8,547/118; the United Kingdom, 5,748/290; and the Netherlands, 4,217/180. For comparison: the U.S. has 35,241 infections and 473 deaths; Russia, 438/1; and China, where the Coronavirus broke out in November, 81,496/3,274. (These figures are taken from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center tracking map and updated continually. I’ve given you the figures for 10.00 It has already struck some of us. The latest figures for Hungary are 167 confirmed cases of infection and seven deaths. All but one were elderly and most had unrelated health problems. But the general expectation is that these figures will rise sharply in coming days in imitation of Italy’s long crisis. Without that expectation, the figures for Central Europe would not look so alarming, especially in comparison with other regions. Here are the figures for infections and deaths in neighboring countries: the Czech Republic, 1,165/1; Poland 684/8; Romania, 576/5; Croatia, 306/1; Slovakia, 186/0; Ukraine, 73/3; Belarus, 81/0; Moldova, 94/1; and Slovenia, 414/3. The Baltic states are doing slightly better; most of the Balkans, including Greece, slightly worse, but all are in the same ballpark.<span class=""drop"">B</span>

Globally, the virus has infected more than 465,100 people in at least 171 countries and killed at least 20,977 people.Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of the World Health Organization, which has officially named the pathogen Covid-19 or coronavirus, remarked that “having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing.”“Look, everyone knows it came out of China, but I decided we shouldn’t make any more of a big deal out of it. I think I made a big deal. I think people understand it,” Trump told Fox News. “But that all began when they said our soldiers started it. Our soldiers had nothing to do with it.”On Tuesday, however, the president said he intended to back off using the term.President Trump has referred to the virus as the “Chinese virus,” saying the term refers to the fact that it came from China, and criticized the suggestion by a foreign ministry spokesman that the U.S. military may have brought the virus to the country. Beijing, which initially “What the State Department has suggested is a red line,” one European diplomat said, However, diplomats from the other G-7 members, which include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, disagreed with the use of the term.“With respect to the statement, I always think about these meetings the right answer is to make sure we have the same message coming out of it,” Pompeo told reporters at the State Department. “There was a lot of discussion today amongst the G7 about the intentional disinformation campaign that China has been and continues to be engaged in.”Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has argued that it is important to note that the coronavirus pandemic originated in China and that Beijing was responsible for warning the rest of the world about the deadly respiratory illness.The U.S. was responsible for drafting the joint statement and included the term in the document, which was circulated among G7 foreign ministers.An attempt by G-7 member countries to agree on a joint statement fell apart after the State Department insisted on including the phrase “Wuhan virus” to refer to the global coronavirus outbreak.National ReviewFollow Us",0,G-7 Failed to Agree on Joint Statement after U.S. Insisted on Using ‘Wuhan Virus’

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span> Today’s world of accelerating medical advancements is ushering in an age of personalized medicine in which patients’ unique genetic makeup and biomarkers will increasingly lead to customized therapies in which samples are inherently small. This calls for a fast-learning, adaptable FTCM environment for generating new data. In sharp contrast, the status quo FDA environment provides a yes/no approval decision based on statistical tests for an average patient, i.e., a one-size-fits-all drug approval process.It is time for us to learn and finally reform the FDA. This is a good point by Nobel Prize Economist, Vernon Smith, and Bartley Madden:Also, it is no secret that the government, and the FDA in particular, botched the coronavirus testing. For more on that, you can read The whole thing is excellent.Further, the Kefauver-Harris Amendments dramatically increased the time and cost of getting new drugs approved. Evidence provided by University of Chicago economist Sam Peltzman suggests that the number of new drugs approved dropped by 60% in the decade following the law change. We have fewer ineffective drugs, but also far fewer effective ones than we could have had.The federal government requires pharmaceutical companies to prove that their drugs are both safe and effective before putting them on the market. Before 1962, companies needed to prove only safety. While there is some appeal to this two-hurdle approach, evidence suggests that there is only a slight benefit and a tremendous cost . . .The same problem exists in the development of drugs. At the The whole thing is Finally, Congress will need to create the mechanism by which patients can opt to forgo the protections of vaccine approval based on informed consent. . . .In addition, Congress should extend liability protections to COVID-19 vaccine candidate manufacturers. Sections 300aa–22 and 300aa–23 of title 42 of the US Code provide some liability protection for vaccine manufacturers, but only for those products that have complied with all requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including the requirement to have received an approval from FDA….To make this possibility viable, Congress should instruct the FDA to publish vaccine trial data in real time. . . .As to what Congress should do, Dourado writes:“The traditional vaccine timeline is 15 to 20 years,” says Mark Feinberg, president and CEO of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. Given the urgency of addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is moving faster: For example, researchers have skipped the usual animal testing of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine candidate and have already begun human clinical trials in Seattle. Even so, experts say it will take between a year and 18 months to get an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine on the market. This means that even if society “flattens the curve” and gets some respite via warm summer weather, the population will still be unprotected in the fall, when colder weather could drive an increase in the COVID-19 contagion again.Unfortunately, the FDA approval process is not likely to result in a marketable vaccine until sometime next year. To resolve this mismatch in timelines, Congress should create an expedited process to allow patients, via a process of informed consent, to use vaccine candidates that have not yet completed the full FDA approval process. . . . At the Mercatus Center, Eli Dourado, who is now at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University, So basically, when it comes to producing vaccines, we were much better and faster at responding to pandemics in 1957 than we are now. That’s not right, especially since creating vaccines should be much easier now than it was back then.Here is “In 1957, when flu swept through Hong Kong, Mr [Maurice] Hilleman identified the virus as a new form to which people had no natural immunity and passed on his findings to vaccine-makers.

No charge.One of Planned Parenthood’s favorite slogans is “Care, no matter what.” As the coronavirus strikes the U.S., the group has revealed once again that its real priority is “Abortion, no matter what.”There are shortages of personal protective equipment across the country, making it difficult for doctors and nurses to care for COVID-19 patients safely. More and more health-care providers are succumbing to sickness themselves, and thousands of retired medical professionals are volunteering to come out of retirement to help manage the crisis. Aren’t there better ways for Planned Parenthood to contribute to this battle than by fighting tooth and nail to profit from abortion?If Planned Parenthood really were an essential health-care organization, as its executives and supporters so often claim, wouldn’t its affiliates be suspending elective procedures such as abortion to focus on helping with the health-care crisis ravaging the country? Instead, the group is wasting valuable time and resources suing lawmakers who are trying to reduce unnecessary instances in which the virus could spread.Again and again, the message from Planned Parenthood’s affiliates is clear: If there’s any chance you might have COVID-19, stay away, but we’ll still be here performing abortions!Evidently, Planned Parenthood would like us all to believe that its centers across the country are providing some kind of vital care to Americans that requires its doors to remain open. A quick review of the websites of the group’s affiliates across the country reveal that Planned Parenthood is fighting to keep performing abortions, but little else. Here’s a small sampling of their sites’ messages about COVID-19:In a fundraising email yesterday evening, Planned Parenthood acting president Alexis McGill Johnson wrote, “Planned Parenthood doctors, nurses, cleaning staff, counselors, and administrators do so much, from reassuring a scared patient to providing expert care without judgment. And right now, they’re putting their health and lives at risk to ensure patients get the information and care they need.”In contrast to these decisions in Texas and Ohio, officials in some states such as Washington and Massachusetts have explicitly declared that elective abortion will be classified as an essential service, even as limits are placed on other medical procedures.“While doctors and nurses in Texas work around the clock to care for patients suffering from COVID-19, Governor Abbott is interfering with the personal medical decisions of Texans by using this pandemic to advance his political, anti-abortion agenda,” the Center for Reproductive Rights lawsuit said yesterday evening.This decision was made in conjunction with the governor’s announcement that all health-care facilities in the state should postpone any procedures that are not medically necessary, so that health-care professionals can handle a surge in COVID-19 cases. In Ohio, lawmakers made a similar decision, and abortion-rights activists have vowed to present a legal challenge there, too.Several abortion-advocacy groups including Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and the Lawyering Project, are suing Texas governor Greg Abbott after the state designated surgical abortion as a non-essential procedure that must be suspended until the coronavirus crisis has passed.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Planned Parenthood Sues Texas for Designating Abortion ‘Non-Essential’

No charge.But if you play the cowbell, then “The failure of a New York City hospital operator to stock a sufficient supply of medical masks is not an indictment of the world economic order or “capitalist pathologies.” It is an indictment of the management of New York City hospitals, and hospitals elsewhere. That is a big enough problem without imagining it to be grander than it is.Our relationship with China has to be managed like our relationship with any other country. In the case of China, there are elevated risks that have to do with the nature of the country and with the nature of the Beijing regime, and we owe it to ourselves to be realistic and clear-eyed about what those are and how they can be most effectively mitigated.A more narrow and more difficult issue than that of international trade is that of trade with China, which groans under the corrupt misgovernment of a single-party gulag state. Trade with China is the right policy for the United States for both economic and national-security reasons: Trade leaves both countries better off in material terms, and the United States is better off with a middle-income China than with a poor and desperate China. While it is wrong to believe that liberal reform in China will come to pass inevitably as a result of its increasing prosperity and its limited economic reforms, almost none of what the United States wants from the U.S.–China relationship is easier to get from a poorer China. Even real problems in the economic relationship, the theft of intellectual property prominent among them, are more tractable to Washington when China has more to lose. The problem for the United States is that Washington is lazy and reliably reaches for the wrong weapon — tariffs — because our national leadership lacks the intellectual capacity and long-term political commitment to pursue our interests in an intelligent and productive way.The current shortages are less matters of trade than they are matters of the “just in time” model of inventory management and operations, which works very well — if things actually get done in time. The current shortages of everything from ventilators to toilet paper are forcing a reevaluation of the risks associated with low inventories. That’s a classic problem of mispricing risk: Businesses immediately realize the savings associated with reductions in the costs of building and operating large warehouses, but the tradeoffs are not given their due because the costs imposed by them are not immediate. Many of the people who say “We need to run the government like a business!” would not say that if they knew more about the way many American businesses are run. It is worth keeping in mind that Krispy Kreme went bankrupt selling doughnuts to Americans.  
   There are risks to relying on overseas suppliers for surgical masks, or for any other good. There also are risks to not tapping overseas suppliers for surgical masks and for other critical goods. An earthquake in Utah can take a factory offline as quickly as a You will not be surprised to learn that these exceptions are cynically exploited. In 1975, the Swedes sought a special exemption from GATT for sneakers as a matter of national security, arguing that “decrease in domestic production has become a critical threat to the emergency planning of Sweden’s economic defense as an integral part of the country’s security policy. This policy necessitates the maintenance of a minimum domestic production capacity in vital industries. Such a capacity is indispensable in order to secure the provision of essential products necessary to meet basic needs in case of war or other emergency in international relations.” Marco Rubio has made roughly the same preposterous argument for restricting imports of sugar, which just happens to benefit an important constituency back home in Florida. Considering the Swedish sneaker gambit, the   
   The question of critical goods and how they are traded during emergencies is a very old one. Most of the world’s major bilateral and multinational trade agreements specify exemptions for products that are deemed critical to national security or other pressing non-economic concerns; indeed, dealing with such questions is a big part of what we have to have such agreements in the first place instead of the one-sentence free-trade treaty: “There shall be free trade between But most of the world’s medical face masks are made in the so-called People’s Republic of China and in Taiwan.

But the psychological damage to, and the increased medical vulnerability of, those who have been thrown out of work should not be overlooked either.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Faria-e-Castro is undeniably correct to regard the impact of COVID-19 (and the efforts to contain it) as a unique economic event. Nevertheless, any hopes that there will be a V-shaped recovery in the jobs market already seem (to me) as unrealistic as any assumptions that there will be a V-shaped recovery in the economy generally. To be sure, once the shutdowns come to an end (or even start tapering off), net hiring will pick up sharply, but not by enough, I suspect, to restore employment levels to where they stood before the virus struck. Consumer spending (70 percent of U.S. GDP) will recover somewhat. But, as I mentioned It is, however, safe to assume that the longer the shutdowns continue (at least at current levels), the greater will be the number laid off, and the lower the rate at which battered companies will, despite the stimulus package, be willing to hire them back. Corporate balance sheets will be depleted and, in certain industries, the ability to plan (not least when it comes to capital expenditure) for 2021 (something that would ordinarily be relevant for recruitment within the next few months) will shrink every day the lockdowns persist.It’s an indication of just how difficult it is to make forecasts as the U.S. enters deeper into uncharted territory that, after making some (necessary) adjustments for employees in health care and education, Faria-e-Castro was left with a range of potential unemployment rates that stretched out between an “optimistic” 10.5 percent and a “pessimistic” 40.6 percent. And he still had to qualify that vast spread with caveats. For example, “many businesses may send workers home with pay instead of laying them off outright.”And last week’s horrifying data will not be the last.

But they at least remind me that we have free men among us.Small and weak nations often have highly conformist public cultures. Try to find much in the way of public criticism and dissent against the authorities from within the confines of the “opinion corridor” in Sweden. See what kind of movement is available when everyone is wearing “the green jersey” in Ireland. The cost of fractiousness — of real effective freedom — is often felt to be intolerably high. An unspoken logic holds that if “our strategy” is failure, at least everyone will suffer together and no one of “us” will be really held accountable.  
   Men and women who say such things as Hitchens and Reno often receive a misdirected scorn of the sort that is heaped on the anonymous and heedless revelers on spring break who defy the advice on social distancing and who would be insensible to much rational argument anyway. But these are not heartless men, nor are they pretending to be.  
   The fact is, we’re taking unprecedented and potentially ruinous action to avoid the wreckage of this virus. “Lockdown” is a word from prison management, it is a tool for controlling riots among prisoners. Now politicians impose it on entire nations, and I think Reno could have been more careful about how he characterized his opponents. Most of those who disagree with his prudential judgment about these strictures on normal life hope to avoid causing others needless suffering. They are not mere cowards. But Reno has been denounced widely for abandoning his pro-life convictions, though this charge is false. Christians are obliged to forbid killing, and to heal the sick. They are not obliged to prevent every death. Just as they do not counsel trying to prevent every miscarriage by imprisoning pregnant women and monitoring their unborn children, ever at the ready to cut open. Can educated people really be surprised that a Christian who believes in eternal life argues for bravery in the face of danger?Reno makes the argument that we are not obliged to do “everything” to avoid death and that his Christian coreligionists are forbidden from doing evil to avoid it. He writes, “We must reject the specious moralism that places fear of death at the center of life.”Over stateside, the editor of Hitchens points to mitigating factors. The great bulk of those dying are already very aged and already suffer from various other illnesses. So, how much higher really is the total rate of death? How much does the rest of society really have to fear? And how will anyone explain the cost of lost livelihoods, careers, homes, and nest eggs if these dire warning turn out to be wrong? Hitchens points to a number of other dissenting and sensible-sounding skeptics who should know what they are talking about. He asks, “Who really is taking the unjustified risk here?”<span>NOW WATCH: </span>In the Untied Kingdom, journalist Peter Hitchens is one such skeptic. Hitchens has a contrarian streak. He was a conservative against the Iraq War long before that was fashionable. He is a champion of claims that chemical-weapon attacks in Syria, ones that whipped up pro-war sentiment, are dubious and false. He is against the foolish anti-Russian hysteria that passes for high-status opinion. Those are the ones where I think he’s right. He thinks Boris Johnson is a boob. On COVID-19, he has made his case Even as I disagree with many of their assertions, I want to counsel some patience and even appreciation of the virus skeptics. We need them.My friend is a doomsayer of another sort, worried that a public-health scare, one informed by a lot of panic and a good deal of unreliable modeling, is going to cost millions of decent people their livelihoods. In time those conditions will cost many the happiness of their marriages, it will rob them of their homes and of the dreams they worked so hard to keep. It will destroy their confidence in themselves, even if it was just bad luck or timing. I threw the f-bomb at him and he made fun of my temper and told me to take a nap. We were both right, I think. Either way, I’m sorry.I should know. A friend and I sparred recently. I’m closer to the virus doomsayer camp and believe that these miserable lockdowns, especially the one in New York, will save the functioning of our health-care system and justify itself in lives saved. I have been angry at locals who were slow to embrace social distancing. And I feel justified in that, given the growing infection rate of the population that surround me in my county and the dire reports from hospitals. I have never believed the simple and stupid predictions of millions infected at once and millions dying, which rely on simple exponential math absent social context. I simply have believed that the data lead one to conclude that hospitalization rates for an outbreak of this disease are intolerably burdensome and that all cities and nations that failed to control them with travel restriction, testing, and contact tracing go into shutdowns, harmful as they are.<span class=""drop"">W</span>

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.Christian Hartmann/Reuters<br/>Hospitals around the world have battled shortages of ventilators and critical protective equipment while treating coronavirus patients.

AdvertisementThe biggest problem may not be the fatality rate, however marginally over or under 1 percent it turns out to be. It is that about 10 percent of those who have tested positive for the virus have required hospitalization — 6,322 out of 65,512, by my last count of the COVID Tracking Project. If this percentage holds steady, and the number of positive reported cases were to rise into the hundreds of thousands and then the millions, our medical system would be overwhelmed. That could result in a higher fatality rate not just for COVID-19, but also for other medical conditions that will exacerbate without treatment. That is why the stress on social distancing and “bending the curve.” What we’ve really got is less a disease challenge than a health-care management challenge.Some perspective, then: Out of 330 million Americans, fewer than 1 percent have been tested. While testing should have been more widely available early on, it is increasingly available now, and of those who have been tested, the vast majority (85 percent) have tested negative. COVID-19 is infectious and can be deadly, so it cannot responsibly be sloughed off. That said, the percentage of Americans who’ve gotten it is tiny, and it has been fatal for just a thin fraction of those.This does not account for negative tests — i.e., people who feared they might have COVID-19, got tested, and were negative. To repeat, that is based on reported In the six days between March 20 and March 25, new deaths continued hovering around 1 percent of newly reported cases. But as reported cases rose dramatically from 5,588 to 13,355 (as expected, due to the spread of the virus and much more widely available testing), there was a slight uptick in the death rate. On a day-to-day basis, it varied from a low of 0.9 percent on March 20 (49 out of 5,588) to a high of 2.0 percent on March 24 (225 out of 11,075). Meanwhile, looking at the national numbers since the outbreak started, So, let’s pick up where I left off last week, with the day-to-day death rate, computed by comparing each day’s new deaths with new reported cases — which, as I acknowledged, is itself a rough and imperfect comparison.I suspect that this explains the ostensible contradiction between Dr. Fauci’s two comments on the fatality rate. Context is everything. In his House testimony, Fauci was confronting a political narrative that COVID-19 is really no worse than flu, and reliance on reported cases showing a 10:1 difference was a useful rebuttal. In his essay, he was trying to demonstrate to other scientists (and whatever sliver of the public reads medical journals) the imprecision of our knowledge about exactly how much worse COVID-19 is than flu.Trying to figure out an accurate fatality rate depends on how we count these different categories. It is a tricky business, rife with uncertainty. Yet it’s what must be done in order to grasp whether we are dealing with something that is just marginally worse than flu, or rather is significantly worse, even exponentially worse. Things appear deceptively dire if we calculate death rate solely by reference to reported COVID-19 cases; but the picture is deceptively benign if we measure deaths against an inflated conjecture about the non-reporting population.To summarize, we have (a) people who get COVID-19 and have reported; (b) people who get the SARS-CoV-2 virus and have reported, and who may not necessarily develop COVID-19 (although they are counted as if they have done so); (c) people who report because they fear they have the virus, but who test negative (so we assume they have not had the virus); (d) people who have the virus but do not report (meaning we can only estimate how many such people there are); and (e) people who have other conditions that could be mistaken for the virus and who do not report (meaning that counting them would skew our already uncertain estimate of virus cases that have gone unreported).Mind you: I am not criticizing the CDC. Given that a person who has the virus can pass it along to someone else, who could then develop the disease and potentially die, it makes perfect sense to treat these two discrete things as if they were the same — even though the virus could be so mild as to cause no symptoms, and the disease could be so severe as to cause death. All I am saying is that this mucks up the mortality math.And then there is the matter of how stats are kept. A person who does not report is not a When Dr. Fauci wrote that the COVID-19 fatality rate may be well under 1 percent when one factors in “cases” involving asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic people, I assumed that he was talking about people who get the virus but do not report. But beware of that promiscuous word   
   Not everyone who contracts the SARS-CoV-2 virus will develop the COVID-19 disease. This is where things get murky in the public debate, and why I say the difference between   
   On the distinction between the two, HIV/AIDS is a good analogy. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is the disease caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus; but not everyone who tests HIV-positive will develop AIDS. With respect to our current coronavirus pandemic, the disease is labeled COVID-19 (shorthand for corona virus disease, discovered in 2019); it results from exposure to the virus called SARS-CoV-2. The latter label, There are various kinds of coronaviruses. Specialists in this area take pains to distinguish a Thus has my amateur obsession with epidemic fatality rates led to questions that, more often than not, lead to still more questions, not confident answers. It is a healthy reminder of how much I don’t know, and of how perilous it can be for analysts to step outside their lanes. Let me, in any event, share some of what I’ve learned — or, at least, think I’ve learned.My point is that Fauci is a scientist, and I am not. If he is humble about our state of knowledge, I need to be humility on steroids. That said, my training is in proving things, or disproving them, as the case may be. I’m supposed to be able to do that across disciplines. At a certain basic level, facts are facts, even if there is more complexity in epidemiology than in, say, securities fraud. Regardless of the subject matter, the proof business calls for a healthy dose of skepticism about claims of certainty and a jaded ear attuned to bias in such claims — does the proponent have a motive to make things seem better or worse than they are? To weigh competing claims, one must also insist on apples-to-apples comparisons. That is not always easy because claimants tend to talk past each other, never agreeing on the meaning of the terms they spout.Don’t take that as a jab at Dr. Fauci. To the contrary, I am impressed by his paradoxically confident humility. Fauci is first and foremost a scientist. When he doesn’t know, he says he doesn’t know. When he does “know,” he allows that this knowledge reflects nothing more or less than our best current information; more data is always welcome, and we must be willing to check our premises.<span>NOW WATCH:</span>Confused? Me too.Regrettably, I reckon the answer must be that even if the coronavirus dipped perceptibly below 1 percent, it would still be much worse than flu. Why? Because none less than Dr. Fauci (among others) says so. Though he recently wrote that the rate More specifically, could the fatality rate for the coronavirus disease that sprang from China late last year (The question naturally arises: The elusiveness, I noted, was evident from an observation by Anthony Fauci, the esteemed immunologist of the National Institutes of Health and President Trump’s White House Coronavirus Task Force.

Because they’re saying, well it’s hard to travel, yadda yadda yadda,” Massie said. “Well, last night, 96 out of 100 Senators voted. All we would need is 218 out of 435 to vote,” he added, pointing to a section of Article I in the U.S. Constitution that states “a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business.”The Senate passed the economic relief bill, 96 to 0. But now there’s a hitch: “During negotiations, most lawmakers expected that once a deal was reached, the House of Representatives would pass the bill by voice vote. This is where they ask for all in favor to say “aye,” all opposed to say “no,” and the chair concludes the ayes have it. In the official congressional record, the measure is recorded as passed by voice vote, with no specific vote attached to a particular member. Voice votes are usually only used on less consequential measures such as renaming a post office. But voice votes can only be used with unanimous consent; any member who wants a recorded vote can ask for one and the measure cannot pass until the vote of each member in attendance is recorded.We’ve always had carnival barkers, pork-addicted idiots, and used car salesmen in Congress. Representative Jim Traficant of Ohio used to bellow “Beam me up, Mr. Speaker” on the House floor with hair that looked like a dead squirrel resting on his head. (Traficant’s only real policy demand in any given situation was that the federal government buy American-made products . . . which looks pretty appealing from the perspective of 2020!) But when a real crisis hit — the Kennedy assassination, Watergate, the Iranian hostage crisis, 9/11, the anthrax mailings — the grownups were in charge, at least enough to keep their eye on the ball. No one held up the entire government response so they could get some new federal offices in their district.Some might argue that when the country faces a problem that is so gargantuan, far-reaching, and so complicated, it makes little difference if Congress wastes another day with Nancy Pelosi insisting the legislation include mandatory diversity reports on corporate boards, an additional $45 million for the USDA Agricultural Marketing Program, an additional $78,000 to the Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture, and so on. (Clearly, government’s burn rate has increased while revenues have decreased. It’s difficult to budget for the future without credible revenue forecasts, which is needed now more than ever before.Patronis said he’s interested in looking into the effects of the Rainy Day Fund, in a light-to-severe hurricane season, and how we would potentially overlay that with REC forecasting and estimates:“Considering the COVID-19 pandemic the [state] Revenue Estimating Conference should convene to ensure there is sufficient revenue to pay for fiscal year 2020-2021,” Patronis told me in an email. “We all share in a constitutional obligation to ensure the state can raise sufficient revenues to finance the appropriations prerogatives of the legislature.”Down in Florida, Each day, we’re seeing some sort of new ramification of this timeliness problem. The federal government delayed the deadline for filing federal income taxes from April 15 to July 15, and because people often need to know their federal tax bill to calculate their state tax bill (and vice versa), many states are doing so as well. But most state budget years start July 1. Kashkari, who administered the TARP program, knows a heck of a lot more about this than I do, but his conclusions line up with my instincts — get the money out the door as fast as possible, and fix what goes wrong later. “If a bunch of businesses get help that didn’t need it, that’s fine, that’s much better than taking a decade to rebuild the labor markets. After the fact, some investigator or some reporter is going to find some business, some millionaire who got a free gift from the government because we didn’t tailor the program. And people will say, ‘Oh my gosh, how outrageous.’ And there will be congressional investigations. We just have to get over it, err on the side of getting more help out there.”Economic analysts are now looking past the current quarter projecting that the economy In 2008 the crisis was focused on the financial system and housing market. It was much more narrow. This is, in effect, an economywide shock. When [Hurricane] Katrina hit New Orleans, it was a catastrophe. This is like a natural disaster hitting the whole economy at once. Except for food and grocery stores, most other sectors are all being squeezed at the same time, across industries. All these firms are drawing down bank lines of credit because they’re scared. That’s the mechanism by which this natural disaster is going into the financial system.Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, The money going to move slowly, while the economic effects of the coronavirus crisis are accelerating more quickly. It is hard to overstate the scale of the economic shock of more or less declaring that all “nonessential” businesses have to close their doors indefinitely.Once the economic-relief bill is signed, it will still take time for the money to reach the people. I probably spoke imprecisely; the U.S. government does not have a Third World structure or response to the coronavirus crisis. But some of our members of Congress are treating it with the rank opportunism, selfishness, small-mindedness, greed, and provincialism we associate with Third World kleptocrats, tinpot dictators, and other leaders who make bad situations worse. The house is burning down, and they’re blocking the fire truck from getting to the scene because the firefighters don’t plan to use their preferred kind of fire hose.This week’s <strong>No, Congress Did Not Rise to the Challenge of Coronavirus and a Collapsing Economy</strong>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for the coronavirus.

Thanks to prominent organizations such as the We ought to consider whether, properly speaking, abortion is In Texas and Ohio, lawmakers say no, and face swift lawsuits from abortionists, who apparently have nothing better to do during a health-care crisis than take politicians to court. In Massachusetts and Washington, lawmakers say yes, and, unsurprisingly, groups that profit from performing abortions or suing pro-life politicians agree.The irony of this statement appears entirely lost on them, as it is on most people who have trained themselves to disregard the biological fact that every successful abortion results in a dead human being.

They are threats to global public health — indeed, matters of life and death.The stories indicate that Hubei Province, far from moving toward normality, is being locked down again by people and police in the surrounding provinces who know the real situation in Hubei. One video showed a riot that occurred when Hubei police tried to open the border with Jiangxi — people and police in Jiangxi revolted because they would be exposed to Hubei.The evidence they present about COVID-19 contradicts official narratives. Stories on Chinese social media, censored or removed almost as soon as they appear, reveal how local governments cover up new cases and how hospitals are ordered to report new cases as normal flu or pneumonia.The government, which claims that virtually no new COVID-19 cases have appeared recently in Wuhan, has begun to relax the lockdown in Hubei Province. But while the Chinese regime tries to control perceptions of events inside the country, widespread anger and intensified distrust at the government’s moral and administrative failures is giving rise to a groundswell of citizen journalists attempting to break through the official propaganda machinery of CCTV, CGTN, <em><strong>Breaking the Media Blockage</strong></em>Of course, China also extensively censors new media. A Harvard University study found that Chinese authorities block as many as 18,000 websites, including many standard, independent sources of international news. Among the terms censored on the Internet are “human rights,” “oppression,” and references to Tiananmen Square and the dissident and Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo. The BBC, which had often reported critically on the Chinese government, is blocked in China. All books published in China are censored. The extent of censorship and control over the media by the CCP cannot be better described than by Xi Jinping himself, who in 2016 said, “All the media must bear the Party’s surname.”Last year, CNN’s Beijing correspondent Matt Rivers reported extensively on how, during his trip to Xinjiang province, he had been subjected to repeated visa checks, harassment by local officials, attempts by the authorities to block his reporting, and physical trailing. The FCCC report adds that Chinese authorities, through intimidation and explicit warnings, regularly pressure people to avoid speaking to foreign media representatives. Journalists and their sources are monitored by facial recognition and other surveillance techniques.Criticism of the treatment of the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang has also drawn the ire of the authorities. In 2018, Megha Rajagopalan, the Beijing bureau chief for BuzzFeed News, was unable to renew her visa. During her six years in China, Rajagopalan had reported extensively on human-rights abuses, including the detention of Uighurs and others in Xinjiang province. The Committee to Protect Journalists considers the government’s refusal to renew visas in such cases to be “acts of retribution.”Beijing has also established red lines for foreign correspondents. In particular, anything critical of Xi Jinping and his family is forbidden. Last year, Beijing declined to renew the credentials of another Three correspondents from Beijing has delayed and placed restrictions on visas for foreign journalists. While the standard length of a long-term journalist visa, J-1, is one year, many foreign correspondents who have reported critically about the Chinese regime have received curtailed visas. In 2018, five correspondents received curtailed visas. In 2019, at least a dozen received visas for six months or less. Truncated visas require frequent renewal, and Beijing has made that process more arduous not just for the journalists but for their families as well.

					© 2020 National Review				Our Capital Letter email newsletter delivers a weekly digest on finance, business, and economics from an NR sensibility.In the aftermath of this crisis, central bankers will have to reflect on how to enact sustainable monetary policy in a zero-interest-rate environment. While the Fed has taken a “whatever it takes” approach, throwing liquidity at every problem it encounters, a long-term crisis playbook may require structural reform of the financial system and monetary regime.But what amounts to a partial nationalization of systemically important financial markets also raises concerns. The lender-of-last-resort function is historically unpopular because the public sees “liquidity provision” as a byword for bailouts. The extension of credit to smaller firms, coupled with fiscal efforts to alleviate consumer hardship, should somewhat temper those concerns. But not everybody gets access: Riskier corporations, many of which have incurred losses through no fault of their own, do not qualify for these loan programs. The Fed can’t rescue everyone, which leaves it open to accusations that it picks winners and losers.<strong>Consequences<br/>
</strong>  
     
   <strong>Main Street Business Lending Program (MSBLP)<br/>
</strong><strong>Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF)<br/>
</strong>Corporations that defer payments on PMCCF debt will be barred from buying back stock or paying dividends until they begin to pay interest. The legislation also includes the possibility of loan forgiveness for corporations that retain 90 percent of their employees.The Fed will hold these loans in a special-purpose vehicle (SPV), capitalized with $10 billion from the Treasury. This structure allows the Treasury to own the debt while the Fed funds and administers lending facilities. Since the Federal Reserve Act bars the Fed from incurring losses on investments, the Treasury’s equity stake in the SPV allows the Fed to buy securities it would otherwise be unable to.
<strong>Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF)<br/>
</strong>This time around, the Fed acted early to provide liquidity to funding markets, first with a massive intervention in the repurchase-agreement market, and later with similar measures in commercial-paper and money markets. Now, with the passage of the Senate bill, the Fed will wade into medium-term debt markets for the first time through three new lending facilities.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a similar fire sale, but on a broader scale. Over the past month, plummeting revenue has led to a shortage of cash across the economy. Unable to pay their creditors without selling assets, some struggling businesses must liquidate a portion of their holdings to avoid defaulting. But during a crisis, nobody wants to buy assets. Fearing a protracted economic shutdown, panicked investors flee into cash and risk-free Treasury securities, and businesses become cash-starved.In 2008 a run on short-term debt securities caused a liquidity shortage. As markets sold off during the mortgage crisis, investors fled from even the safest markets. That triggered a “fire sale,” whereby falling asset prices depressed collateral values and fueled demand for cash, which further pushed down asset prices. Otherwise solvent businesses found themselves unable to fund daily operations. In order to smooth the markets, the Fed invoked 13(3) authorities to intervene in commercial-paper and money markets, as well as to guarantee certain asset-backed securities and provide cash to primary credit dealers.Section 13(3) of the <span class=""drop"">D</span>

It was an exhibition of executive branch respect for the Bill of Rights and the separation of powers, not a matter of running roughshod over them.Let’s remember, too, that what DOJ posited were Would one result of these proposals be that some defendants will be detained “indefinitely” without trial? Of course it would . . . but that can’t be helped because we do not know when the COVID-19 crisis will subside enough for routine court functions to resume. But we are not talking about locking the jailhouse door and throwing away the key. DOJ suggested that the continuing need for the emergency measures be regularly reevaluated, and that the measures be terminated upon a judicial finding that they are no longer necessary. “Indefinite” detention here means To forestall these problems, the Justice Department has These are not normal times. In COVID-19 hot-spot areas, such as New York City, many court functions have been suspended. If a grand jury cannot convene, it is legally impossible to file an indictment. If a statute of limitations lapsed during that time, no future prosecution would be permissible. If a petit jury cannot convene because the threat to health is too serious, there can be no trial; if a trial cannot be scheduled, the defendant’s speedy trial rights could be violated (even if the statute of limitations has not run). And, as should be obvious, social distancing is not conducive to maintaining conditions of prison confinement, which are innately populous and intrusive. If these matters were not addressed, the epidemic could result in the release of many dangerous criminals back into the community, and the inability to prosecute them for provable felonies.  
     
   By law, any accused has the right to a speedy and public trial, based on an indictment returned by a grand jury. Federal offenses have statutes of limitations (usually, five years); if a charge is not filed within the limitations period, prosecution is time-barred. Under the Speedy Trial Act, if a defendant is arrested on a complaint (a sworn statement establishing probable cause), prosecutors have a limited time in which to file an indictment — basically, between ten and thirty days, depending on whether the defendant is detained or granted bail. Once an indictment is filed, the trial must presumptively commence within seventy days of arraignment. There are various legal grounds for extending some of these deadlines, including a court finding that it is in the interests of justice to do so. Even in normal times, then, a defendant who is denied bail can languish in custody for a long time awaiting indictment and trial. That is not uncommon in violent crime cases, as well as cases involving defendants who pose a high risk of flight.For one thing, the ongoing crisis will be more extensive in geographical and temporal scope. The coronavirus is spreading throughout the country. Although some states have “hot spots” while others have barely been affected, all states will have to prepare. Even if President Trump’s optimistic hope to begin a return to normalcy in a couple of weeks proves to be practical, the return will be gradual and social distancing will be a fact of life throughout America for many months. To put it mildly, that complicates the convening of grand juries, the conducting of jury trials, the making and processing of arrests, the detention of prisoners, etc.By contrast, there are As it turned out, although many of the 9/11 security precautions remain with us to this day, the emergency arrangements in the justice system were short-lived. There were no additional waves of attacks, so the imperative of further “hardening” government facilities that were obvious targets (such as courthouses in which jihadists had been prosecuted) ebbed. Terrorist attacks are different from natural disasters in that they raise legal issues pertaining to treatment of the criminal culprits: questions about whether civilian due process must be applied; about who can be detained, where, and on what standard of proof; and so on. But these special contingencies only applied to a relatively small subset of people.Because conditions were too dangerous near Ground Zero, we had to move operations to a nearby “offsite” along the West Side Highway. It became the hub of what developed into the most expansive investigation in American history. The probe stretched nationwide and overseas, in conjunction with desperate search and rescue operations (nearly 3,000 Americans having been killed — and original estimates suggesting the death toll could be multiples higher), intelligence analyses indicating that additional jihadist strikes could be imminent, a campaign of anthrax mailings (real and fake) that further compromised government functions, and preparations for responsive combat operations in Afghanistan.I was still a federal prosecutor when we had to deal with the 9/11 attacks. The World Trade Center, which was destroyed on September 11, 2001, was located just a few blocks from the federal and state courthouses in lower Manhattan. Also in the vicinity were detention facilities, the headquarters of both the New York City Police Department and the FBI’s New York field office, and prosecutors’ offices (including the Southern District of New York, where I worked).<span>NOW WATCH: </span>This is an unavoidable consequence of any kind of “critical incident” — the jargon that security personnel and first responders use to describe catastrophic events, which include everything from natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes) to medical emergencies to terrorist attacks.The profound challenge that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to our health-care system, potentially in all U.S. states and territories, is the predominant news story of 2020. Less obvious but all too real nonetheless is the challenge it poses for the criminal-justice system.The Justice Department made some proposals . . . but it did so at the urging of Congress, not unilaterally. The upshot was to empower the courts, not the executive. In fact, “empower” is an overstatement. The idea was to give judges latitude to deal with due process deadlines that necessarily become problematic when some catastrophic event undermines the capacity of courts to function.It should by now go without saying that the distorted story was remote from reality.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

I defended my pro-life position, which is rooted in both my Catholic faith and science. “I could never give up protecting the most vulnerable human beings in the world, simply to win an election,” I said. “My faith teaches, and the Democratic Party preaches, that we should serve everyone, especially the most vulnerable. To stand in solidarity with the vulnerable is to become vulnerable. But there is no higher calling for anyone.”One adviser said that I should focus on what our team accomplished for my constituents on transportation, the environment, jobs and quality of life. That was tempting; I am proud of our legacy. But a friend told me to be prepared for one question: “Looking back, would you have done anything different?” Abortion advocacy groups poured millions into my opponent’s campaign. If I had simply changed my position on abortion, there probably wouldn’t have been a contest. Abortion proponents wanted to hear me express regret about sticking with my pro-life beliefs.The morning after I narrowly lost my congressional seat in last week’s Illinois Democratic Primary, I decided to make a public statement and answer questions from the press. With the current wretched state of political discourse, I felt it important to be gracious in defeat.BONUS BONUS BONUS: At the This is not an ideological claim about how persons and peoples Radical environmentalists have long warned that humans are not fit for the preservation of nature. The ascendant idea is that nature is not fit for the preservation of human life. Even if we manage to beat the virus, the argument goes, our destiny demands that we beat nature, breaking loose from its constraints. To truly live, we must live “off-world,” not in nature but in “space”—outer space or cyberspace, and preferably both.After coronavirus, the podlife programming is more clearly driven by a more than ideological force. Rather than a politics meant to manage our nature in accordance with our ideals, podlife is taking shape as a technology meant to secure our life by severing it from nature. The virus provides overwhelming evidence that nature is not our home.Consider the following example.

What remains unclear is if European publics, which are bearing the brunt of the suffering caused by the epidemic, will be as easily willing to overlook the malfeasance of Chinese officials.The Chinese government has been fast-tracking shipments of medical aid to Europe, which has become the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic that first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The largesse appears to be part of a public relations effort by Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Communist Party to deflect criticism over their responsibility for the deadly outbreak.6. At Gatestone Institute, Soeren Kern spotlights Red China’s to spin Europe on its Wuhan Virus High Jinx. Maybe the problem with such a simple and sensible statement of purpose is that it limits the role of campus administrators to supporting the academic functions of the university. Or maybe it is just not cosmopolitan enough for contemporary sensibilities. Glance at a university’s mission statement today and you will likely find a rambling paragraph expressing a cornucopia of vague and often incoherent aspirations. Most reference some combination of cultivating citizenship (not Yale’s revision), critical thinking, leadership, and (especially) appreciation for diversity and global perspectives. But apart from that last example, few institutions build a curriculum that advances the goals they articulate.The mission statements that purport to guide colleges and universities illustrate an identity crisis in higher education. Not long ago, most institutions conceived of their purpose in clear and simple terms. As the Honorable Judge José Cabranes pointed out, until recently Yale embraced the commonsense purposes of a university: “to create, preserve, and disseminate knowledge.” The best way to advance those goals is beguilingly simple: hire the best faculty, establish strong curricula, reward teaching and research excellence, and foster a free and open marketplace of ideas.Many factors have conspired to fuel the crises roiling higher education today. Perhaps the most important, and the reason so few institutions react appropriately when they arise, is that colleges and universities are facing a crisis of purpose and identity, one that diverts focus from improving the quality of students’ educations in favor of the distraction 5.

At The biggest milestone on the road to sickness, however, began in 1999, as Malanga writes, “when union-backed Gray Davis became governor and union-backed Phil Angelides became state treasurer, and the CalPERS board was wearing a union label.” The state legislation that followed, mimicked by local measures across California, dramatically increased pension benefit formulas. Not only were benefits increased, but they were increased An excellent history of how California’s public employee pension systems moved inexorably towards the predicament they’re now in can be found in a It’s been a long time since California’s pension systems were responsibly managed. Back then, they made conservative investments, paid modest but fair benefits to retirees, and did not place an unreasonable financial burden on taxpayers. But a series of decisions and circumstances over the past thirty years put these pension systems on a collision course with financial disaster. And like a progressive, initially asymptomatic disease, it is impossible to say exactly when these pension systems crossed the line from health to sickness.3. At California Policy Center, the great Ed Ring says that the Golden State is long past the time for government-union pension reform. Even as TU’s administrators deliberately poisoned the university community, the trustees erected a steel wall to protect them. Faculty Senate resolutions proposing alternatives to True Commitment, and finding that the administration violated constitutional provisions relating to shared governance, were deemed “inconsistent with the University’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws” by the board of trustees.<em>Several poignant moments occurred this week with many on our campus taking a stand: a stand in the name of our students; a stand for what is best for our community; and a stand against a nameless group that has attacked not only our university but many within it.

Vitalina discovers her ex’s life in the dilapidated immigrant ghetto and begs a debauched immigrant priest, Ventura (another Costa alumni), to perform the funeral mass. But the opening shot itself already suggests a burial procession, anonymous blacks staggering through an empty street at night with cruciform objects towering overhead. Repeating themes of desolation, loneliness, regret, and immiseration from previous films, Costa expresses his sympathy in dirge-like fashion. This highly stylized film, as visually striking as the others, is representation by the Rembrandt of the ghetto.Costa’s acclaim by film culture’s elite conflates his artistry with obsessive liberal sympathy: Hollywood hucksters, book hustlers, gallery exhibitionists, and grant applicants all sing the same lament about “seeing themselves represented.” And when indoctrinated young people join the chorus, having been taught that complaint is the beginning of self-assertion, you realize that none of them are aware how much multicultural representation already exists in popular culture. They surely can’t know the work of Portuguese art filmmaker Pedro Costa, whose new film,21. Armond White, expounding on Pedro Costa’s The scholarship in the catalogue is superb. The essays are loosely connected to the themes of the show, but meaty. They convey a sense of Rome in 1600, moving through the reigns of four popes and their courts. Artists were practiced, passionate networkers. They had to be, since popes and cardinals were prime patrons as well as competitive, jealous ones. The first chapter of the book calls Rome “the navel of the world” — not flattering, as it suggests an entire culture of narcissism, but I take the overall point. The church avoided what could have been a fatal Reformation fusillade. Rome was an immensely rich city around 1600 and in a building boom. New churches and palaces needed decorating. Each papacy did more than trigger musical chairs. It enriched a new crop of people from the provinces having family ties with whoever was pope. This stimulated patronage, too.I didn’t like two aspects of the show’s design. The lighting makes the galleries, which are new, look tired. Paintings are displayed against pastel panels placed against white walls. A bad choice, and a candidate for Baroque horror. Pale yellow and pinks make the pictures look like black holes.The gallery on love pushes the point — I saw the Titian show on his Metamorphoses six-footers from 1551, and they’re very sexy. Caravaggio turns up the temperature on carnal feeling, though, and Baroque artists do seem to recruit from LA Fitness. But love is love, and it is ageless and invites all styles. The gallery on jest is ineffective, and I think that’s why the curators made it so small and put it at the end of the show, where people are tired, hungry, powder-room-inclined, or lusting after nude Bacchus tea towels in the shop. It’s a difficult theme in any event. Conveying another era’s sense of humor is almost impossible.The show is a thrill, but I have to say I liked the portrait — or vivacity — gallery the most. The heads stay on the torsos, for one thing. Portraiture before 1600 veers toward iconography and status. There’s plenty of personality, to be sure, but it’s subordinated to “Who am I?” and “What am I?” rather than the more complex “I’m thinking this or that” or “I’m baring my soul.” Baroque is the age where the “speaking likeness” is introduced, and Bernini does it best in marble. His subjects have torque, expressions, and open mouths. Domenichino’s (1581–1641) portrait of Giovanni Batista Agucchi, from around 1610, shows a vivacious, engaged figure, his expression concentrated and tense. He’s demanding our attention. It’s small, 24 by 18 inches, but its informality and intensity give him presence.20. Brian Allen shares a take on a special exhibit of Baroque art (from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam), conscious that attendance has been corona’d. It is a novel about people who make bad choices, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for bad reasons, sometimes, especially in cases of romantic attachment, simply because they are young and callow and do not know what they really want, what will really make them happy, or that they are, in the famous phrase from For years, my great white whale was 19.

But they perform an invaluable service — doubting, testing, scrutinizing, looking for weaknesses. That is how institutions — be they businesses, political parties, or governments — get better. But getting better can be painful.In difficult economic times, the usual self-righteous political types and self-interested market incumbents — including business executives whose financial interests are not identical to those of the shareholders who actually own the firms — lament the vultures and the ghouls, and several predictable lamentations will be heard upon the land.

Policymakers in Washington should take this gambit seriously. But they shouldn’t assume that America’s friends and partners do. In recent years, China — working via companies such as Huawei and through its much publicized “Belt and Road Initiative” — has greatly expanded its global economic footprint. Yet far too many of China’s trading partners remain blind to the true nature of China’s political system and the threat it poses.These lies serve a higher purpose for the party: turning coronavirus into a net positive for the CCP. Consulting firm Horizon Advocacy published a report last week, based on Chinese government and state media sources, that details China’s plan to position its economy in strategic sectors to box out other industrialized nations still reeling from the virus’s impact. According to China’s State Administration of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense, China must jumpstart its economy to “pave the way for international market expansion after the epidemic is over.”Of course, China is right to give this medical equipment to nations in need. But its government is bundling misinformation with this aid.Amid this crisis, the CCP today is hard at work — not to right its wrongs, but to rewrite the past. The party is waging a multi-front propaganda campaign that shifts the blame for coronavirus to the United States, while claiming that China’s response bought time for the rest of the world to prepare. The Chinese government is also presenting itself as a global health provider, shipping face masks and test kits to nations with shortages.16.

Peter Spiliakos makes the case for trade with China — but not dependence. The Help America Vote Act was signed by President Bush in 2002. It helped to modernize the nation’s voting infrastructure by calling for the creation of computerized voter-registration rolls at the state level, constructing federal accessibility guidelines to accommodate voters with disabilities, and setting up the Electoral Assistance Commission to certify state voting systems. Pelosi’s coronavirus-relief bill, which ostensibly is intended to provide “relief” to businesses and individuals affected, directly or otherwise, by the coronavirus, inexplicably seeks to amend the Help America Vote Act, and, in so doing, upend state election protocols by requiring states to allow same-day voter registration. Twenty-nine states do not allow such registration. Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia do. It is not clear that this divide need be resolved at all, much less that it ought to be resolved at the federal level. And it is completely unclear why such a provision has any place in an emergency economic-stimulus package.<em> </em><strong>Requiring States to Allow Same-Day Voter Registration</strong>All companies that receive federal aid related to COVID-19 would be required, under the House proposal, to appoint at least one-third of their board members through “a one-employee-one-vote election process.” In other words, if companies accept aid from the federal government at a moment when, because of a completely unforeseeable global catastrophe, demand has cratered in response to a lethal pandemic, the House bill would force them to completely upend their boards of directors to no conceivable end other than the fulfillment of a longstanding progressive wish.<em>Aid Recipients Must Allow Labor to Appoint One-Third of Corporate Board Members </em><strong>Restructuring Corporate Boards</strong>14. John Hirschauer dissects Nancy Pelosi’s effort to put the Warren / Sanders stink on the Coronavirus bailout bill. The kind of coordinated response Gates had advocated in 2015 would have made all the difference in the current fight against COVID-19. Many have been invoking war as a metaphor. But in truth, it’s more than that. To have a fighting chance against a pandemic, each country needs an army of health-care workers. In the same way that there are military corps, countries needed to have their own medical reserve corps who, in conjunction with the army, are able to provide an immediate and wide-reaching response in the event of an epidemic. Five years ago, Gates called the absence of such provisions “a global failure,” noting that even the World Health Organization was funded only to monitor these epidemics, not to respond to them. NATO prepares for war with war simulations; why was the U.S. not preparing with more germ stimulations?These weaknesses had been made obvious during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, during which the Gates Foundation had shipped supplies to help doctors and nurses protect themselves from the virus and prevent its spread. At least 10,000 people died from Ebola. It was only a matter of luck that it wasn’t millions more. Part of this was because the virus became infectious only when people were severely symptomatic and bedbound. Another reason is that it did not make its way into densely populated urban areas. “If there is any good to have come out of the Ebola crisis,” Gates said, “it is that it has acted as an early warning, a wake-up call.” For the weakness it had exposed was not merely “that the system didn’t work well enough” but rather that “we didn’t have a system at all.”In 2015, Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, gave a TED talk in which he warned that the greatest risk of global catastrophe in the world today was “not missiles, but microbes” — not nuclear war, in other words, but an influenza virus. “If anything kills more than 10 million people in the next decade it’s most likely to be a highly infectious virus,” he warned. Gates’s concern was that while huge sums had been invested in nuclear deterrents, “we’ve actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic.”13. Maybe, Madeleine Kearns wonders, we should have listened to Bill Gates. Even if the Italian data showed no bias, however, a third factor must be taken into account: namely, the annual death rate in the U.K. In 2018, one full year before COVID-19 was heard of, 541,000 people died in England and Wales, most of them older and less healthy people. That’s almost the exact prediction in the IC report of how many people would die if nothing was done. Are the 510,000 deaths in addition to the annual total? Apparently not. They will be part of the total. Naturally, no one now knows how large a part, since the deaths are hypothetical and the deceased still alive. But since those Brits who died in earlier years are similar in relevant respects to the great majority of Italians who died The lesser bolt is that, as we noticed earlier, researchers have only lately begun to point out that the Italian statistics may greatly exaggerate those deaths caused Amazingly enough, two bolts have suddenly appeared from the blue.If we could solve the medical flaw in this strategy — and that might be possible: read on — it would still face a more obstructive flaw. Governments have already committed themselves and their prestige to a bold (if mistaken) policy and invested immense amounts of political capital in it. It’s hard enough to change their minds before they’ve made such a commitment; it’s nigh impossible to do the same when they’ve bet the house on a single number in roulette. Okay, events will force a retreat to mitigation or something like it eventually. But it would require a bolt from the blue to get them to change now.12. John O’Sullivan, in Budapest, awaits the full force of the virus, and in a wide-ranging piece considers the role of immigration into the impact on certain countries, and response strategies that may not jibe with medical realities. If so, Biden could do worse than stay in his basement for the duration.His victories on Super Tuesday and afterward showed that Democrats were willing to turn out en masse for an uninspired candidacy, and it may be that the same dynamic will hold in November.All that said, Biden deserves credit for his insight that the Democratic Party wasn’t defined by woke Twitter and that Obama-Biden Democrats, as he calls them, still constituted the party’s center of gravity. He correctly believed — or hoped — that African-American voters would see him through.Instead, Biden’s verbal tangles, incomplete sentences, and weird mix-ups are amusing — and concerning. They will be used to argue that he isn’t up to the job, but they don’t make anyone hate Biden. He can’t even generate strong feelings in his partisan opposition.Biden’s candidacy holds interest only to the extent he is gaffe-prone. His misfires aren’t Hillary Clinton–style gaffes, laced with arrogance and an insulting dismissiveness that makes them a rallying cry for the other side (e.g., “deplorables”).11. Rich Lowry finds the lack of a spotlight helpful to the Democrat cipher. This is a bizarre situation for the man who may well be the next president of the United States. It is too early, and events are too volatile, to reliably predict how the coronavirus outbreak will alter the outcome of the election. Trump could end up benefiting from the rally-around-the-leader effect of crises, or he could be sunk by public discontent with his leadership, a faltering economy, and a generally sour national mood. By any estimation, however, Biden was already at least a tossup chance to win in November before this, and the central theory of Trump’s reelection (a booming economy) is now out the window. There is every reason to take seriously the significant likelihood that Biden will be the leader of the free world ten months from now. And almost nobody cares to hear from him in an hour of peril. It is hard to recall a time when a major-party presumptive nominee has been so invisible and so irrelevant on the national stage.Biden is frozen in place, without a lot of modern precedent to fall back on. He can’t use his own office to get in the news or do anything useful, because he has been out of office for four years. He can’t hold campaign rallies, which are unsafe for crowds and particularly hazardous to a 77-year-old candidate. His party’s leaders on Capitol Hill seem uninterested in getting him involved in negotiations, even within their own party. He can’t even formally celebrate wrapping up the nomination, because Sanders stubbornly insists on continuing his campaign. So Biden is reduced to reading embarrassingly halting statements off cue cards in an empty room.10. “Biden” you say? Name sounds familiar. Dan McLaughlin whereabouts-wonders about the Forgotten Candidate. And then there is the matter of how stats are kept. A person who does not report is not a When Dr. Fauci wrote that the COVID-19 fatality rate may be well under 1 percent when one factors in “cases” involving asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic people, I assumed that he was talking about people who get the virus but do not report. But beware of that promiscuous word Not everyone who contracts the SARS-CoV-2 virus will develop the COVID-19 disease. This is where things get murky in the public debate, and why I say the difference between 9. Andy McCarthy get investigative and explores the reality of “fatality rate.” A more narrow and more difficult issue than that of international trade is that of trade with China, which groans under the corrupt misgovernment of a single-party gulag state. Trade with China is the right policy for the United States for both economic and national-security reasons: Trade leaves both countries better off in material terms, and the United States is better off with a middle-income China than with a poor and desperate China. While it is wrong to believe that liberal reform in China will come to pass inevitably as a result of its increasing prosperity and its limited economic reforms, almost none of what the United States wants from the U.S.–China relationship is easier to get from a poorer China. Even real problems in the economic relationship, the theft of intellectual property prominent among them, are more tractable to Washington when China has more to lose. The problem for the United States is that Washington is lazy and reliably reaches for the wrong weapon — tariffs — because our national leadership lacks the intellectual capacity and long-term political commitment to pursue our interests in an intelligent and productive way.The current shortages are less matters of trade than they are matters of the “just in time” model of inventory management and operations, which works very well — if things actually get done in time. The current shortages of everything from ventilators to toilet paper are forcing a reevaluation of the risks associated with low inventories. That’s a classic problem of mispricing risk: Businesses immediately realize the savings associated with reductions in the costs of building and operating large warehouses, but the tradeoffs are not given their due because the costs imposed by them are not immediate. Many of the people who say “We need to run the government like a business!” would not say that if they knew more about the way many American businesses are run. It is worth keeping in mind that Krispy Kreme went bankrupt selling doughnuts to Americans.There are risks to relying on overseas suppliers for surgical masks, or for any other good. There also are risks to not tapping overseas suppliers for surgical masks and for other critical goods. An earthquake in Utah can take a factory offline as quickly as a 8. Pandemic or not, free trade is working, says Kevin Williamson. Goldman’s economists are, however, anticipating that GDP will recover by (an again annualized) 12 per cent in the third quarter. But the damage inflicted on the economy is not going to be easily undone: Unemployment was expected to peak at 9 percent. Bad though that unemployment figure may be, my guess (and currently that is all that any forecast can be) is that it, along with hopes of a more or less V-shaped recovery, will turn out to be too optimistic. Even if the parts of the economy that have been braked or switched off were to start up again tomorrow, it would take a while for them to return to any approximation of business as usual.The economic numbers are beginning to come in, and, predictably enough, just about wherever you check, they are appalling. In Pennsylvania alone last week there were more than 7. The recovery will be slow, says Andrew Stuttaford. Overall, China has returned to Europe about as much medical equipment as it received, taking credit for in effect receiving supplies from northern and central Europe and delivering them later to southern Europe — but unlike the European donors, the Chinese aren’t doing it for free. Chinese Communists are boasting about their magnanimity and are letting Germany and the European Union take the blame for shortages across Europe that are largely due to Chinese hoarding. This is not philanthropy; this is mercantilism.The most remarkable case, however, is in Italy, where China’s ostentatious delivery of supplies and doctors has caused much consternation among Americans who worry that the United States is losing its global leadership role. Media accounts often omitted that the supplies were bought and paid for by the Italians, when the most newsworthy element to the story is that China actually kept its commitment to deliver what it sold.Chinese propagandists also claim that China is leading the way in responding to the crisis internationally, which is patently false. China’s much-publicized gift of 1 million masks to Japan is a grand and magnificent gesture, albeit only one-third as grand as prior Japanese donations of nearly 3 million masks to China.6. Mike Watson unmasks Red China’s charity. The incandescently moronic jibber-jabber (I won’t call it “reporting”) about the bizarre case of the Arizona woman whose husband died after taking fish-tank cleaner he and she incorrectly supposed to be the drug Trump touted in the White House is the kind of barnyard waste product that shouldn’t even make it to national news reports, and ordinarily wouldn’t, except that the media seem to be getting a near-erotic thrill out of any scrap of information they think might set off Trump. The dead Arizona man didn’t take chloroquine. He took chloroquine phosphate, in a massive dose. Please run the tape for me where Trump said, “Everybody take a spoonful of fish-tank cleaner to save your lives.” “The difference between the fish tank cleaning additive that the couple took and the drug used to treat malaria is the way they are formulated,” dryly noted CBS News. Oh, you don’t say? Because I was going to put rubbing alcohol in my martini tonight. Or is rubbing alcohol differently formulated than gin?Folks, and by “folks” I mean you absolute freaking Muppets, are you trying to get Fauci fired? Do we really want to start over with a new specialist in infectious diseases in the White House? Would you be happy if Omarosa were Trump’s chief adviser on epidemiology? Would you be more secure if Jared were the last man standing during the medical briefings?We know that the president is unusually thin-skinned and capricious, that he is keenly and perhaps unhealthily focused on what the media are saying about him at any given nanosecond, that he has a short temper and a quick fuse. He goes through cabinet secretaries like a newborn goes through diapers. And pointing out his errors is the legitimate business of CNN, NBC, ABC, MSNBC, the 5. Given the crisis at hand, what’s with those people, says Kyle Smith, who are rooting for a Trump In sum, with the use of new treatment protocols and medicines, wider testing, and the approaching summer, we can get the incidence of infection down to a level that allows most people to work and keep the economy alive. Otherwise, make no mistake, if the present economic somnolence continues, many Americans are going to sicken and die — but from the economic virus in reaction to the coronavirus.If we can get hard data out and the lethality rates descend to near flu levels, and once Americans see that well over 99 percent of the population survives the virus, then they will have confidence in the return of the economy, buy and sell stocks on the basis of innate worth and return rather than panicked speculation, and again rehire, run, and expand their businesses.4. Potter’s RELATED: As Alexandra DeSanctis reports, the public has no trust in the MSM’s handling of the Coronavirus crisis. Worse than all that — or maybe it’s for the best — everyone can now see the hive mind of political journalism at work on Twitter.All three of those things happened this week.Sorry, it’s difficult to trust a newspaper that Some of that trust has been corroded over years of Obama adulation, echo chambers, conspiracy mongering, and knee-jerk partisanship.

Prevention and simple justice require that Beijing accept consequences facing any other wrongdoer — including an end to dangerous practices and extending at least partial compensation to those so grievously harmed outside China. International diplomacy, legislation, executive action or legal proceedings here and abroad should seek to ensure Beijing acts responsibly.In any just and lawful setting, actors who recklessly pursue hazardous activities would be held accountable for foreseeable harm caused to others. It would not matter if the wrongdoers did not intend such harm; it would be enough that they knowingly persisted. Exacerbating harm by concealing it and retarding mitigation only increases such liability.Having unnecessarily caused and exacerbated a worldwide pandemic, untouchable Chinese officials added their next outrage — blaming America. Beijing shamelessly poses as both victim and savior, seeking disproportionate praise for sharing genome information, casualty data, and, relative to the harm, limited supplies.1.

Nationally, more than 2,000 have died — double the number just two days ago. That amounts to a domestic cumulative fatality rate of roughly 1.7 percent, significantly higher than the 0.1 percent fatality rate for the seasonal flu. Doctors in certain states have begun to administer On a more encouraging note, New York and New Jersey have had success in lowering the rate of new cases. The table below shows the compounded daily growth rate over the past five days and the change in that growth rate from five days prior. The steep declines in New York and New Jersey reflect that while that number of confirmed cases continues to grow, the rate at which it is increasing is slowing. California has not yet seen case numbers as high as those of New York and New Jersey, so the growth rate in new cases has only slightly declined. Louisiana’s numbers 13 days into its outbreak continue to be troubling, but the state has high testing capacity, which could enable it to elude the outbreak we’re seeing in New York.Seventeen U.S. states have now confirmed more than 1,000 cases of coronavirus, with the national total over 119,000.

God willing, we’re going to win.Here’s a reason for optimism. The whole life-science apparatus, public and private, of virtually the entire world, and much of its entrepreneurial and innovative energy, is now focused on a single problem: how do we kill this stinking virus?Meanwhile, Michael’s I think as time goes on we’ll approach the disease less as a national epidemic than as a rolling series of local epidemics. The federal government will continue developing therapeutics, buying supplies, and ensuring the public and health authorities have the best available information, while governors and mayors adjust the degree of social distancing in their jurisdictions as they play whack a mole with the virus.Larry Kudlow and Deborah Birx both have the same message for you: wash your hands, damn it. And keep washing them, not only while the disease is epidemic but even after it has become endemic, which it will be until we get a vaccine.Finally, everyone is in agreement that the core epidemiological responses are and will remain necessary: vigorous and more effective testing, urgent efforts to expand hospital capacity and find better therapeutics, isolation of the sick and quarantine of those exposed, social distancing for high-risk people, and common sense hygienic practices that everybody ought to practice even in a normal flu season and that are the single most effective way to interrupt the vectors of the disease.They know the United States isn’t China. We’re not going to Moreover, health officials are well aware that if restrictions are too comprehensive, or last too long, people will simply disobey them. That’s why, in places where severe restrictions are in place, health authorities as well political officials are practically begging the public to comply.If the immediate purpose of severe restrictions is to relieve the stress on the health system, it’s not surprising that medical authorities are reluctant to take a step which, whatever else it does, is likely in at least one respect to increase the stress on the health care system.In fact, health officials know that severe quarantines and restrictions are at best a mixed bag, even looking only at the medical consequences. As one example, public health authorities often resist closing elementary schools because 1) we need health care workers to fight an epidemic, 2) quite a lot of health care workers have children, and 3) when young children are out of school, their parents have greater responsibility to care for them, which means 4) the practical result of closing schools is that, at least in the short term, health-care systems lose manpower.And medical authorities are acutely aware that economic stagnation isn’t good for public health. I have a decade’s The economists are not saying that we should allow the virus to rage on unchecked. Economics may be a bloodless discipline, but the people in it care about human life too; and even if they didn’t, they know that uncontrolled epidemics aren’t exactly a recipe for economic growth.When the administration’s coronavirus task force has a meeting, the economists and public-health officials are not sitting at opposite sides of the table glowering at each other. Both groups acknowledge the co-dependence of the equities that are stake.The whole debate rests on the assumption that there is an inevitable trade off between health interests and economic interests. That assumption is mostly false, and the officials who actually have to make decisions, and their advisors, understand it is false.Michael Brendan Dougherty National ReviewFollow Us",0,All in the Same Fight

No charge.   On the other hand, if he is declaring the power to order quarantines Consequently, the president does have the power to restrict travel between the states of persons reasonably believed to be infected with COVID-19. I would assume that this means the power to prevent people who reside (or who have recently been present) in “hot spot” areas from traveling from those areas to other states. If that is what President Trump means by “QUARANTINE,” he’s probably on solid ground.To summarize, although American citizens have what has been interpreted to be a fundamental right to travel between states, the federal government’s very limited power to curb such travel undoubtedly includes authority to prevent the spread of infectious diseases — and COVID-19 certainly qualifies as one. Congress has the power to regulate interstate travel, and it has delegated that power to the executive branch for the purpose of protecting against the spread of infectious diseases.The latter of those two is clearly, at best, the outer margin of federal authority. In our constitutional system, the states are sovereign over internal affairs, including Obviously, the government has a compelling interest in preventing the spread of communicable diseases. 
Of course, no right is absolute, even one said to be “virtually unconditional.” Congress, not the president, has the power to regulate interstate commerce. A federally imposed regulation on the right to travel between states may be upheld, even if the effect is to abide unequal treatment of citizens, if it is “shown to be necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest.” (I’m again quoting This right to interstate travel has three components: (a) the right of a citizen of one state to enter and leave another state, (b) the right to be treated as a welcome visitor while in another state, and (c) the right to resettle in a new state and be treated equally with the citizens thereof.the nature of our Federal Union and our constitutional concepts of personal liberty unite to require that all citizens be free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement.This is rather a grandiose pronouncement given that there is no explicit right to travel in the Constitution. Indeed, the word The Supreme Court has long recognized that citizens of the United States have a constitutional right to travel from state to state. In its 1998 decision in The powers of the federal government in general, and of the president in particular, to quarantine American citizens are not cut-and-dried.<span class=""drop"">O</span>

No charge.It is important to observe that central players in the U.S. oil/gas sector oppose these proposals, arguing explicitly that market forces should be allowed to work. One example is the CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, who  Senator Inhofe and his senatorial allies justify their request for a “dumping” investigation on grounds of “energy independence.” The public discussion of that topic is nothing if not confused: However counterintuitive it may seem, the degree of “dependence” on foreign sources of energy is irrelevant, except in the case in which a foreign supplier or foreign power can impose a physical supply restriction, perhaps through a naval blockade or a military threat to ocean transport through, say, a narrow strait. Because the market for crude oil is international in nature, nations that import all of their oil (e.g. Japan) pay the same prices as those that import none of their oil (e.g. the U.K.). A change in the international price of oil, caused perhaps by a supply disruption, yields price changes in the import-dependent and import-independent economies that are equal, except for such minor factors as differences in exchange-rate effects. That is why “embargoes” — an attempt to impose a higher price on some subset of the market — Accordingly, it might be the case that those predicting a price recovery relatively soon will be proven correct, but any expectation that exceptionally low prices now will rise sharply (that is, faster than the rate of interest) over the foreseeable future, thus allowing the cartelization and dumping policies to end, is a  It may be the case that the proponents of such market meddling view the proposed government interventions as temporary, to be maintained only until prices return to something approximating “normal” when the pandemic subsides and the Russians and Saudis find an accommodation. Apart from the reality that such policies create interest groups demanding that they be preserved — notice that subsidies for wind and solar power have returned from the dead time and again — the assumption that prices will recover is far more problematic than many assume. Crude oil is a natural resource that can be consumed today or tomorrow; it is “substitutable” over time. This means that the price today is the best market evaluation of the price tomorrow; if a sharp price increase is expected tomorrow, the price would rise today.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Such explicit market manipulation in coordination with the Russians and Saudis does not bode well for future U.S. arguments in favor of allowing international markets to work. Moreover, governments, whether at the federal or the state level, are not in the habit of handing out favors for free. The longstanding assertions of “subsidies for the oil industry” — virtually none of those policies actually are “subsidies” — will be far more difficult to refute once such real subsidies as cartelization and retaliation for “dumping” are implemented. It will become vastly more problematic to argue against renewables subsidies and green new deals — and mindless regulatory costs imposed on oil and gas operations — and other such massive distortionary policies.Government meddling in the oil market, whether at the federal or the state level, inexorably will prop up less efficient producers — the ones most in trouble due to low prices — and make it more difficult for the more-efficient ones to take advantage of their greater efficiency in the face of adverse market conditions. This outcome is inevitable: Production cuts would have to be coordinated or imposed, and political considerations would overwhelm efficiency objectives. Traditionally, we have supported greater market efficiency as a means of conserving the use of scarce resources and thus increasing the size of the aggregate economy, a sound argument that will be more difficult to defend once we resort to market manipulation as a means of addressing adverse movements in market prices for crude oil.And about that coordination with the Russians and Saudis: Precisely how would their promises of reduced output and higher prices be enforced? The ways that prices can be shaved without formally cutting them are numerous: More-lenient credit or payment terms, higher-quality blends of oil delivered at the benchmark price, rebates in the form of foreign aid or subsidized sales of other goods and services, and on and on. And even if the Russians and Saudis were to keep their production and price promises, it is easy to predict that other producers will find ways to increase their sales in the global oil market. Will the U.S. send in the Marines? Obviously not, but the precise means with which any such agreement would be enforced are far from clear.A 10 percent cut in And so it is unsurprising that some public officials are trying to find ways to ease the pain.

There are several pieces of evidence suggesting that the death toll from the coronavirus was significantly higher than the official numbers.Wuhan’s Right now, the Chinese government insists they have defeated the coronavirus and provided a role model to the rest of the world. They contend that there are almost no cases of Chinese people spreading the disease to other Chinese, and Perhaps the most significant and underdiscussed aspect of the biggest story in the world right now is the real status of the coronavirus inside mainland China.<strong>We Know the Chinese Government Is Lying. So Just How Bad Is the Truth?</strong>If we can get through the next five weeks, the worst will probably be behind us.We all know the drill. Stay home unless you absolutely need to go out, and when you go out, try to stay six feet away from people. Don’t gather in groups. “I have criticism of the president below, but I want to encourage one of the president’s better instincts: Give people hope. Show them the signs of progress. Remind us of how strong we can be. Reassure us the country and the world that we can get through this, because we are going to need all the reassurance we can get.You notice few of those figures listed above would be considered “senior citizens.”More cases overall means more people need hospitalization, and more cases inevitably means more deaths. We’re starting to see names and faces attached to the numbers: But here’s what we know: For the last week, the number of new cases is increasing by anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000 each day. Yes, some of that increase reflects more widespread testing. Yes, many of those people will recover without needing hospitalization.Everything we are seeing right now indicates that the coming five weeks or so are going to be brutal. You can quibble with this projection or that projection, because all of them are trying to account for a million little variables that aren’t easily seen: How strong are the immune systems of those currently infected? How well will the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatments work? How well are health authorities keeping the virus out of nursing homes and retirement communities? How much are people practicing social distancing? We’re hoping the worst projections are wrong — and perhaps they’re so scary, they spur people to take additional steps to stop the spread and prevent the bad outcomes that they project.We are at 2,489 as of this writing. We are likely to hit 10,000 in a matter of days, and the final death toll is probably going to be measured in the tens of thousands, perhaps well past 100,000. I don’t say this to depress anyone or frighten anyone, but to prepare people. Maybe we will see that curve bend and flatten. I certainly hope it does.Someone I respect a great deal said a few days ago that Americans would perceive coronavirus as a true disaster if 10,000 Americans died. That number struck me as a number that could be reached painfully quickly.<strong>Brace Yourselves. The Next Five Weeks Are Going to Get Rough.</strong>I wish the news were better, but it is not. The country needs to prepare itself for the coronavirus outbreak and its consequences to get really bad for the next five weeks or so. Also, we know China is lying, but we can only make educated guesses as to how bad the truth really is. The president continues to focus on what interests him.

Random poll testing of the general public should begin without delay.If we can increase the nationwide random-testing rate to 5,000 per day (about twelve daily in each congressional district), then once the time lag is assessed, repeated poll testing of the population would provide predictive information about what to expect in the near future, giving advance intelligence to our defenders about how hard the enemy virus will hit us and when and where such blows will strike.Let’s say that the poll tests show that the general infection rate is, in fact, the same 1 percent as seen so far with Congress. That would mean that instead of there being 120,000 infected Americans, there are over 3 million. It would also imply a much lower lethality rate than 1.8 percent, although care must be exercised in drawing conclusions in this regard, since the deaths occurring today need to be compared against not today’s infected population but what its size was in the recent past, as there is a time lag between infections, illness, and death. Once that average time lag is assessed, the true lethality rate can be computed. This is very important, because if the lethality rate really were 1 percent, then, lacking alternatives, it could make sense to allow risky treatments that kill 0.1 percent of patients, whereas this would not hold true if lethality were only 0.01 percent.It is also probable that deaths by coronavirus are being underreported, or overreported, given opportunistic infectious diseases, notably pneumonia. There is reason to suspect this is the case for Germany, which reports 560 deaths in 63,929 cases (compared with 2,612 deaths in 40,751 cases in France), and certainly Russia, which claims nine deaths in 1,836 cases. So all deaths from disease should be tested to see if coronavirus played a role. But clearly, the great unknown that needs to be measured is the prevalence of COVID-19 among the population that is outside the medical system altogether.
To get the right answer, we need to random-test the public. We don’t need to test all 327 million citizens — although, when feasible, that would be very desirable for the purpose of identifying immune individuals and putting them back to work. For the purpose of getting a rough estimate of the size of the infected population, we need to random-test only about 1,000 people nationwide. That is the approximate size of most election polls, and, provided that reasonable care is taken to ensure that the sample is representative of the electorate, such polls can generally predict the outcome within plus or minus 3 percent. It’s true that occasionally a 45 percent–polling underdog can pull off an upset victory, but never a 20 percenter, let alone a 1 percenter.  Limited polls might not always predict the winner, but they inevitably show who is in the competitive range. For purposes of quantifying the epidemic, that would be an enormously valuable correction to our current state of ignorance.The shortage of testing has led to a situation where only VIPs can be sure of getting tested if they suspect illness. Thus we hear about Tom Hanks, Prince Charles, and Boris Johnson testing positive, but how can any such assemblage provide a statistical base? Well, there is the U.S. Congress, where four House members and one U.S. senator have tested positive for COVID-19, for an infection rate of 1 percent and a death rate of zero. But Congress, while arguably politically representative of America at large, is hardly an optimal sample for medical polling purposes. Plausible arguments can readily be made why congressmen should have either higher (they attend lots of meetings) or lower (they don’t take mass transit) infection rates than the general population.But we know that such a conclusion would be inaccurate, because millions of people feeling symptoms are being turned away by testers, and there must be millions more, with and without symptoms, who are choosing not to volunteer for testing. So, without doubt, the size of the infected population is being underreported, perhaps grossly so.For example, as of the morning of March 30, Nobody knows. No one can know what the right course of action is, because the available data to provide a basis for these enormously consequential decisions is woefully inadequate. The most important statistics we need to know to develop a strategy to deal with the situation are the size of the pandemic and its lethality. Current data provides no basis for accurate estimation of these vital metrics.<span class=""drop"">I</span>

The fatality rate in the U.S., so far, is nowhere near that of Italy. Our dynamism is one of the reasons why an early high case count is a not a measure of either national success or failure. It’s not our nature to allow the state to close down borders, travel, or trade, or to stop interactions with the world — or with each other, for that matter. And yet, many of same people who incessantly and cynically warned of the coming Fourth Reich are now blaming the administration for not acting like a dictatorship. It’s difficult to keep up.All of this is worth keeping in mind when as we see journalists harping on the overall case number without context. If you want to continue to utilize this once-in-a-century pandemic as a cudgel against your political adversaries, have fun. But the most important gauges of success right now are flattening the curve so that hospitals aren’t overwhelmed with new patients, ramping up our testing capacity to get a better handle on the virus’s properties, and measuring the number of recoveries from coronavirus. Not owning Donald Trump.It’s also worth mentioning that the timeline of these charts are also uncertain. It’s unlikely we know when the tenth or hundredth case was actually transmitted in China or Iran or even here — and it’s possible that some people had died and some others had recovered before most people understood the magnitude of the future pandemic.Speaking of China, accepting the veracity of numbers offered by the ChiCom government without any skepticism might be Moreover, testing in the United States began slowly before being ratcheted up quickly (and criticism of that delay is a fair one).

AdvertisementIn France, the government waited before making the decision to order a lockdown. Although we also don’t know exactly what is going to happen, I think it’s already clear that we’re going to have to remain confined for longer because we hesitated. The number of people who need to be hospitalized grows faster than linearly, so by waiting to order the lockdown (which presumably will flatten the curve after a while), the government has ensured that, by the time the epidemic reaches a plateau, the hospitals will be fuller than they would otherwise have been. That in turn means that we’ll have to wait longer before it’s safe to relax the lockdown, because, if we do so as soon as a plateau is reached, any influx of patients would immediately overwhelm the hospital system again. I would advise my American friends not to make the same mistake we did.But this uncertainty is not a reason not to act. The most important point I want to make is that we don’t need complicated mathematical models of dubious epistemic status to prepare for the worst. The economic consequences of locking down everyone are very serious, but if we don’t do it and the worst comes to pass, the consequences will be even more severe, including for the economy. I’m not American, but I think there are enough reasons at this point to fear that something really bad is going to happen unless you take strong measures to prevent it. At the end of a two-week lockdown, you can reevaluate in light of what scientists will have learned by then. If it turns out that the virus is less dangerous than we feared, a lockdown of two weeks will not have been the end of the world, but if the virus really is as dangerous as we fear, you’ll be happy that you did it.It’s possible that the number of deaths in countries such as Germany and Japan will soon explode, but it’s also possible that it will stay relatively low. I have no doubt that the coronavirus is intrinsically more dangerous than the flu, but one theory that I personally find quite plausible is that it’s not intrinsically as dangerous as we might have feared — it’s just that we have no vaccine, and so nobody is immune, and that our health systems are more fragile than we might have thought. Consequently, if only a few things go wrong at the beginning of the epidemic, it just takes something a little worse than what we’re used to for the situation to get out of control and turn into a disaster. That would explain why bodies are piling up in Lombardy and in some places in France and Spain, while in many other places the situation seems more or less under control. But this just a theory, and I also wouldn’t be surprised if the virus really were intrinsically much more dangerous than the flu. I think that we will know more in a little while, but for the time being we have to admit this uncertainty. As I also explain in my piece, the situation is really very weird. The data we have are difficult to interpret, generally of poor quality and often difficult to reconcile with one another. For example, why do so few people seem to have died of the virus in countries like Germany and Japan, compared with Italy or even Spain and France, when the virus has presumably been circulating in Germany and Japan just as long or even longer? A whole host of theories, some of which I find plausible, have been put forward to explain the inconsistencies, but the truth is that for the moment they remain speculative and we just don’t know. This conclusion, that we are not in a position to know with any degree of certainty what is going on, is consistent with the result of a recent For example, the authors of the study make the hypothesis that a policy of confinement would reduce contacts outside the household but increase contacts within the household by 25 percent. But why 25 percent rather than 50 percent or 75 percent? The authors had no reason to choose a value of 25 percent, but they had to choose  But as I explain in the piece, it’s unlikely that we can trust the findings of those simulations. Not only could the authors of the study have specified the model in many very different though equally sensible ways, but they also had to make many largely arbitrary assumptions about the value of the model’s parameters. We just don’t know how trying other specifications of the model or how using different values for the parameters would have affected the results. We have no way to know, as the simulations require huge computational resources and are very time-consuming.
The different policies that can be adopted to fight the epidemic affect the rate of contact between people in each of these environments and, therefore, affect the results of the simulation. The main goal of this exercise was to predict with precision how different combinations of policies would stress the health-care system and affect the eventual death toll. Once a combination of policies has been chosen, one just has to run the simulation for a while to see how the pandemic unfolds over time. The authors of the study ran this simulation several times with different combinations of policies in place to see how each affects the spread of the epidemic. That’s how they arrived at the conclusions I described briefly above.The problem is that, as I argue in a Indeed, according to the results of their simulations, the policies that have been proposed to implement such a strategy would not prevent hospital systems from being overwhelmed even in developed countries: In the best-case scenario, the need for ICU beds would be eight times greater than our capacity. If nothing is done, the death toll would be over 2 million in the United States, and, even in the best-case scenario, policies aimed simply at slowing the pandemic without suppressing it would only halve that figure. The authors of the study therefore conclude that, in order to avoid carnage, trying to mitigate the pandemic would be insufficient and that only a strategy aimed at suppressing it was viable. However, their simulations show that it would then be necessary to remain confined until a vaccine or other pharmaceutical solution became available. That could take more than a year.Although it seems clear now that COVID-19 is putting health-care systems around the world under considerably more stress than the flu does, and although I’m strongly in favor of confinement until we know more, I think there is still much uncertainty about exactly how bad the situation is and that people are wrong to assume that this pandemic will kill millions of people. That apocalyptic prediction found strong support on March 16, after a team of prestigious epidemiologists at Imperial College London published a paper on their simulations of the epidemic. Their simulations undermine the strategy of curve-flattening, which consists of slowing the spread of the pandemic to prevent hospital services from being overwhelmed by the number of cases to be treated without seeking to suppress it completely.Although I think people underestimated the seriousness of the threat until recently, many now seem to underestimate how much uncertainty there is about what is going to happen. To be clear: No matter where we are headed exactly, this is no flu.

But we should have no sympathy for the regime that oppresses them and that is still working on a dangerous nuclear program. Trump should understand that Mnuchin’s agenda is undermining one of his key foreign-policy objectives, and it’s serving the interests of Democrats, who would surely revive the nuclear deal if they retook the White House.Hostility to Obama’s Iran deal has been a core foreign-policy position for Trump since he began his presidential campaign in 2015. Trump agreed with Pompeo on the need to withdraw the United States from the pact; he saw the impact of the sanctions on Iran’s ability to fund terrorism. But the president is apparently letting Mnuchin have his way on a waiver that would prop up Iran. Such a waiver would hurt rather than help Iran’s coronavirus victims and all those suffering under the regime’s rule.The recent history of American dealings with Iran has been dominated by that kind of callous expediency. Obama, in his effort to end sanctions on Iran, not only did nothing to improve the lives of Iranian people; he actually bolstered the regime’s ability to threaten its neighbors and tyrannize its people at home. Strengthening Iran by once again loosening sanctions — as Mnuchin apparently wants — out of misplaced sympathy or a desire to accommodate the Europeans or Russians won’t help anyone but the IRGC and its theocratic masters.Sadly, along with other U.S. concessions made during the Iran-deal negotiations, Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry decided they would not hold up the agreement by insisting that Iran free Levinson or produce his body.The story of Levinson’s mission is still classified; it involved CIA officials using him on a mission that was not officially authorized by the agency. This allowed the Obama administration to act as if freeing Levinson was not their responsibility or priority.Levinson’s disappearance is still officially unsolved — Iran has not produced his body. But Levinson’s family has recently said that the Trump administration told them that newly discovered intelligence — reportedly including intercepted Iranian communications — show that Levinson died while in Iranian hands sometime in the past several years.The timing for this decision is also particularly tragic because it comes just after a public acknowledgement that Robert Levinson, a retired American intelligence operative kidnapped by the IRGC in 2007, died while in Iranian custody.This is a huge mistake. Richard Goldberg, of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (a key resource on Iran policy) has argued that we could retain the waiver if the Europeans, Russians, and Chinese promised to “snap back” sanctions in the event that Iran violated the deal. Indeed, under the pact, these countries have pledged to hold Iran accountable. But none of them have any intention of doing so. What they want is to preserve the nuclear deal at all costs; they want to roll back Trump’s sanctions policy, which has made it harder for the Iranians to continue funding terror.  But several months later, it appears that Mnuchin is seeking to change the administration’s basic purpose in dealing with Iran. Rather than replacing Obama’s terrible deal, the administration would bow to European and Russian pressure to maintain it in place. Mnuchin is apparently more interested in good relations with the international community than in using American economic power to roll back the alarming gains Iran has made in the Middle East — gains made as a result of Obama’s misguided attempt to bring about a rapprochement with Tehran.In July of last year, the Treasury Department said it required the extensions so it could gauge the impact of the sanctions on the nations that continue to use the waivers to do business with Iran and to work with its nuclear program. At that time, a “senior administration official” Why is Mnuchin pushing for yet another extension of the waivers?Those waivers are among the last vestiges of Obama’s disastrous Iran deal, which enriched and empowered the regime while also allowing it a legal path to a nuclear weapon.Any sanctions relief will be a gift to the IRGC and the foreign terror groups it funds. For decades, Iran has funneled its oil wealth into a nuclear program whose main goal is the domination of Iran’s Sunni Muslim neighbors — and the ability to threaten Israel’s very existence. If the Trump administration allows the civilian component of that program to continue functioning with foreign help, it will undermine its entire policy agenda; it would also worry the Arab states and Israel, which felt abandoned by Obama.The rogue Islamist regime has been tottering in the past year as its subjects have protested the leaders who have prioritized funding foreign terror and nuclear ambitions over the needs of ordinary Iranians. The Iranian people took to the streets last December by the tens of thousands to demonstrate against the theocrats who oppress them. Thousands were shot down by the regime’s praetorian guard — the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which also controls much of that nation’s economy.<script async="""" charset=""utf-8"" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script>— Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) Startling revelation by In a tweet, Pompeo shared a video of Iranian president Hassan Rouhani speaking about the regime’s goal, which is “cash for its leaders”:But the main problem with the arguments for easing Iran sanctions during the pandemic is that softening our stance toward the regime won’t help ordinary Iranians but it will be a windfall for their rulers.As Pompeo has pointed out, however, there are no U.S. sanctions on medical or humanitarian aid to Iran. The U.S. has even offered to help the Iranians cope with COVID-19, but Tehran has refused American aid.A campaign to pressure Trump to loosen sanctions on Iran has won support from Europe as well as from alumni of President Obama’s administration, including former deputy national-security advisor 
In an administration known for its infighting and diversity of views, a skirmish over an issue such as Iran sanctions is hardly unusual. But with Mnuchin’s view on sanctions apparently winning the day, it’s clear that he has President Donald Trump’s ear on the issue.But the decision was a clear victory for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and a setback for Pompeo, who has been outspoken in his view that that the administration should maintain the pressure on Iran despite sympathy for the country generated by its being hit hard by the coronavirus.But this is deceptive because the restrictions (and the United States has repeatedly granted exemptions to them, for all companies helping the Iranian nuclear program) are a mechanism for allowing continued business activity that would otherwise be illegal under America’s sanctions on virtually all business with or in Iran. In essence, renewing the restrictions — which the U.S. then waives — is a way to preserve one last element of Obama’s nuclear deal, from which the United States has withdrawn in all other respects.This week marked the end of a 60-day waiver on U.S. sanctions against European, Russian, and Chinese companies operating at Iran’s civilian nuclear plants.

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.Strong measures must be taken against the spread of the coronavirus. But they must be tailored to accommodate the citizens’ ability to protect their safety in all aspects and to preserve their constitutional rights.Some of the anti-gun decrees now being issued appear to be motivated by the false premise that limiting gun sales will prevent upheaval in the event that the contagion causes mass shortages and desperation. Yet citizens who purchase firearms must pass stringent background checks to ensure that they are mentally stable and have no felony records or other legal barriers to firearm ownership. They are exactly the kinds of armed citizens needed if law and order break down.Americans should be mindful of the dangers of “emergency” decrees. History tells us that government diktats in response to man-made and natural disasters often lead to unprecedented restrictions on individual liberty that last long after the disasters are forgotten.Everyone wants to slow the spread of COVID-19. The various emergency decrees being issued distinguish between essential and non-essential businesses. What could be more essential than protecting yourself and your family from criminal violence, especially when the Bill of Rights declares it to be an essential right that may not be infringed?Gun sales already had been skyrocketing from the ever-escalating threats of gun bans coming from Democrat presidential contenders. The fear of societal breakdown stemming from the coronavirus has added to the demand for firearms across the country.Some states insist on conducting the background checks directly. That’s the case in New Jersey, where Governor Phil Murphy has ordered “non-essential” businesses, a category in which he includes gun shops, to close. The state police then shut down NICS checks as well, effectively banning all firearm sales. A legal challenge has been filed. By contrast, Governor J. B. Pritzker of Illinois declared that firearm retailers are “essential” and may remain open for business.Buying a gun requires a background check, which in most states is conducted by the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). NICS conducted 2.8 million checks in February, the third-largest monthly total since the system was set up in 1998. Most NICS searches are automated and tell the dealer almost instantaneously to “proceed” or “deny” a sale, although some transactions must be delayed for examiners to research incomplete records.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>New gun buyers are often surprised by how difficult it is to purchase a gun in their state. In Maryland, for example, it takes a month to get a handgun-qualification license. It could take six months in New York, where a judge has to sign off on each handgun license. California has a ten-day waiting period for delivery of a firearm after the sale is approved.The dissenting justices suggested that the constitutional right could be accommodated by allowing the completion of sales with minimal contact.The inability of licensed firearm dealers to conduct any physical operations amounts to a complete prohibition upon the retail sale of firearms — an activity in which the citizens of this Commonwealth recently have been engaging on a large scale, and one guaranteed by both the United States Constitution and the Constitution of this Commonwealth.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, without even mentioning that provision, refused to issue an injunction on behalf of some gun shops against the governor’s order. Yet the Pennsylvania Constitution’s Declaration of Rights declares that “the right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned.”Governor Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, for example, has ordered “all non-life-sustaining businesses” to close their physical locations. The The panic comes at a time when many police departments, to reduce spread of the virus, have curtailed arrests and are releasing certain criminals from prison.

Authorities found an estimated $29.6 million in drugs in the tunnel, seizing 1,300 pounds of cocaine, 86 pounds of methamphetamine, 17 pounds of heroin, 3,000 pounds of marijuana and more than two pounds of fentanyl.Federal agents on the San Diego Tunnel Task Force discovered the “sophisticated” tunnel on Thursday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a release Tuesday. The discovery resulted from a joint investigation by members of the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Attorney’s Office.Federal immigration authorities have discovered a drug smuggling tunnel leading from San Diego under the U.S.-Mexico border and seized nearly $30 million worth of drugs found inside.National ReviewFollow Us",0,"Feds Find Smuggling Tunnel Linking San Diego to Tijuana, Seize $29 Million in Drugs"

					© 2020 National Review				Our Capital Letter email newsletter delivers a weekly digest on finance, business, and economics from an NR sensibility.There’s not much reason to think that things will be very different now.And there should be no illusions that some default instinct towards freedom will stop Americans from succumbing to the intellectual temptations that the response to COVID-19 may send their way. Turning to Uncle Sam in times of insecurity, especially in a country where hard times can be much harder than many places elsewhere in the West is understandable enough. There’s also an unsettling aspect of human nature to consider. It may seem odd to describe a society as mobilized — when so many and so much have been immobilized — but that’s what America now is, thus the frequent wartime comparisons. Despite chafing against some of the restrictions that typically come with it, there are plenty of people who rather like being mobilized. That’s just another reason why countries that have been mobilized tend to stay so for far longer than an emergency might call for, and why the state almost never retreats the whole way back to where it was before that emergency begun.Both individuals and private businesses have been given a dramatic demonstration of the ability of the state to, in the case of the former, upend their lives, and, in the case of the latter, destroy a life’s work. It’s perfectly reasonable for someone to decide that government is acting benignly or taking the right hard choice in the current situation, while understanding that this may not always be the case and adjusting his or her behavior accordingly. So far as firing up those “animal spirits” that Keynes correctly saw were so important in helping a free market along, this is not the approach to take.The chances that the COVID-19 precedents may be abused will have only been boosted by the increase in the size of the state that the pandemic will leave in its wake, an increase made no less alarming by the irony that blunders by government have made no small contribution to the depth of today’s mess. Power and patronage go hand in hand, and with so many new dependents — some likely to be less temporary than others — the role of the state in everyday life is going to be significantly enhanced. Repealing a few regulations that hampered, say, testing for the virus, or the manufacture of masks won’t make up for that.
This is more than a matter of the historical fact that governments have been reluctant to give up powers that they have been handed — or, as during this crisis, put to use. To imagine that large swathes of America could be shut down by administrative order would, six months ago, have been no more than the stuff of prepper paranoia, and yet here we are. And powers that have been used once can be used again, perhaps not in the same way, and perhaps not to the same extent, but they will be used. After all, an “emergency” can be a conveniently flexible concept. Those, for example, who talk of a “climate emergency” will be paying close attention to the precedents that are now being set, as, doubtless, will be Of course, people may reassure themselves with the thought that an extraordinary threat requires extraordinary measures: Once it has passed, everything will return to normal. But to believe that is to believe a great deal, not least that our notions of “normal” won’t have changed substantially for the worse.The real problem is that when human societies lose their freedom, it’s not usually because tyrants have taken it away. It’s usually because people willingly surrender their freedom in return for protection against some external threat. And the threat is usually a real threat but usually exaggerated. That’s what I fear we are seeing now. The pressure on politicians has come from the public. They want action. They don’t pause to ask whether the action will work. They don’t ask themselves whether the cost will be worth paying. They want action anyway.<a href=""https://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2020/03/lord-sumption-speaks-against-hysteria-driven-government-policy-.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Sumption explains how it begins</a>But beyond these largely petty instances of overreach, there are more profound reasons to worry, as Patrick Henry, eat your heart out.The police are doing a difficult job and they are doing it well . . .

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.Presidents are supposed to be able to do multiple things at once, but they are also human, and this president is more easily distracted than most. History is full of examples of governments caught looking the wrong way at the wrong time because their leaders were too busy putting out other fires. The British Cabinet spent the early summer of 1914 worried about the Irish question instead of the dispute between Austria and Serbia over the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, until, as Winston Churchill wrote later, “The parishes of Fermanagh and Tyrone faded back into the mists and squalls of Ireland, and a strange light began immediately, but by perceptible graduations, to fall and grow upon the map of Europe.” Much of the story of America’s delayed reaction to the coronavirus can be told without mention of impeachment, but it is hard to deny that Washington was looking in the wrong direction until a strange light again began to fall and grow upon the map of the world.Impeachment, however, didn’t cause Trump to claim on January 22 that “we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China” or to Some voices in politics and the media (including, On February 4, Trump included a brief mention of the outbreak in Key health agencies within the federal government — the CDC and National Institutes of Health — were not inactive during January, but aside from a ban on foreign travel from China, there was little public leadership from the president. There were early, obvious-in-retrospect missteps such as the CDC’s botching the early coronavirus-testing kits and the FDA’s dragging its feet on approval of private testing development and inspection of equipment. While FDA red tape is a problem inherent to the agency’s design and culture, it is precisely the kind of problem that can be mitigated by the hands-on leadership of a bull-in-a-china-shop figure such as Trump. If you read <span>NOW WATCH: </span>The American response to the coronavirus was, in retrospect, too slow and too complacent. There is plenty of blame to go around. To the extent that impeachment was consuming the finite attention of senior policymakers in the White House and on Capitol Hill, we can only be thankful that Senate Republicans wrapped up the trial by voting down additional witnesses on January 31. Had the Democrats gotten their wish, Washington would have been consumed for additional critical weeks into February looking backward at Ukraine instead of forward at the threat of the virus.Trump’s administration, however, was not paralyzed, even with the president preoccupied. On January 23, David Graham of Donald Trump has appeared “distracted” by the impeachment trial that begins on Tuesday, according to a source close to the White House who speaks to the President regularly. “Why are they doing this to me,” the source quoted Trump as saying repeatedly, telling people around him this weekend at Mar-a-Lago that he “can’t understand why he is impeached.”There was a good deal of debate at the time about who was and was not distracted from what by impeachment. On January 6, The House impeached Trump on December 18. The Senate trial began January 16, was effectively wrapped up with the vote to hear no live witnesses on Friday, January 31, and concluded with the vote of acquittal on February 5, the day after Trump’s State of the Union address. Impeachment was an all-consuming drama for this White House, the Congress, and the Washington press corps. It swamped coverage of the Democratic presidential race just as the Iowa caucuses kicked the voting off. Nearly everyone scoffing at McConnell today was spending vastly more of their energy on impeachment at the time than they were on the virus news out of China. The possibility that impeachment would distract the government from more important things was part of the debate at the time over whether to go through with it. For At the simplest level, if you just ask, “Were President Trump and his senior aides distracted by impeachment?” the answer is, “Of course they were.” But how much that matters requires us to reconstruct the context of two months ago, which now seems like the distant past.Headlines to the contrary notwithstanding, in context McConnell was clearly aiming to give McConnell: He was first, and I think Tom was right on the mark. And it came up while we were tied down on the impeachment trial. And I think it diverted the attention of the government, because everything every day was all about impeachment. But Tom figured this out early, and he was absolutely right.Hewitt: In your experience in the Senate, was Senator Cotton the first one to say hey, Leader, hey Mitch, this is a deadly situation that I do not trust to the Chinese? Was he first?<span class=""drop"">M</span>

Taiwan implemented their quarantine-phone tracking early. The Taiwan CDC literally started tracking visitors from China last year — And then there’s Taiwan, the independent country that some staff at Singapore closed its borders to most visitors, is threatening people with prison time for violating social-distancing rules, and is And even with those far-reaching measures in place, Hong Kong is still seeing If you dive into the numbers, it becomes clear that no country has really managed to completely stop the spread.

Once an arrival returns to his house, SARS hit these countries much harder than the United States from 2002 to 2004, and H1N1 as well, so their populations were already conditioned to take warnings about viral outbreaks seriously. This morning the But it’s worth noting that even with all of these measures, South Korea is still having 100 to 150 new cases and five to ten deaths per day. And we should keep in mind that tracking the virus spread among a smaller population in a smaller area is easier than tracking a larger population in a larger area. South Korea has about 50 million people in about 38,000 square miles. That’s the population of California and Ohio squeezed into an area the size of Kentucky.Most of the discussion about the coronavirus has lamented that the United States hasn’t contained the spread of the virus as well as South Korea has. The South Korean government indeed has done an impressive job, involving massive amounts of testing, the widespread use of masks, and more or less the end of privacy: <strong>The Asian Countries Aren’t out of the Woods Yet, Either</strong>Here in Virginia, the hospital administrators are asking the federal government to open up military and veterans North Carolina: “New Mexico: “Georgia: “Meanwhile, outside of the country’s bigger cities, the surge hasn’t arrived yet . . . but the hospital capacity and ICU beds just aren’t there in the numbers they are in our biggest cities.New York City, obviously: “Chicago: “Michigan: “Arizona: “Certain parts of the country are starting to bump up against their hospital capacity limit, and it’s not just the places you would expect.You can find plenty of videos of the recently deceased at Brooklyn Hospital Center and Maimonides Medical Center and Bergamo, Italy and elsewhere.

Why didn’t his producers book a single expert who could beseech his viewers to start wearing masks, to shutter their non-essential businesses, and to avoid church and sporting events? Why didn’t he mention coronavirus at all?

We are now seeing deaths that stem from infections that happened before drastic social-distancing restrictions, business shutdowns, and quarantines were put in place. One hopes that we will soon see the mortality rate come down as a lagging result of these measures, along with widespread additional testing. Still, we’re now told there are going to be millions of cases, so the difference between a rate of over 2 percent versus a rate of around 1 percent would be catastrophic.It is said that we should expect the numbers to rise because much more testing is being done. I confess to being confused by this. Obviously, additional testing would explain the spike in the number of reported cases. But the rate is the rate. One would think it would stay fairly constant regardless of the number of cases (notwithstanding the wide disparities between rates when we compare countries). In fact, if we assume the mortality rate should be around 1 percent, then one would expect that more reported cases would drive the mortality rate down. To the contrary, it is surging.I’ve been continuing to keep tabs on a daily mortality rate, based on each day’s reported deaths and new cases. To repeat, this is a rough and imperfect computation, since the newly reported deaths overwhelmingly do not arise out of the day’s newly reported cases. It is, however, a useful indication of how things are trending. Right now, it is frightening. Just ten days ago, the daily rate was hovering over 1 percent. Yesterday, it was 3.29 percent as deaths hit a record daily high of 912 (well over 300 more than on any previous day), as new cases swelled to 24,742. The numbers have been getting worse all week, with just one day (March 29) slightly under 2 percent, and most others well over it (2.70 and 2.75 percent on, respectively, March 28 and 30).Remember, Dr. Anthony Fauci has been According to the Those of us who have been closely watching the fatality rate (see Yesterday, in explaining the decision to extend the heavy restrictions on communal and economic life, President Trump and his coronavirus task force related that we are in for a very rough next three weeks (up from what the president had just recently estimated would be two weeks).

There’s a reason that nobody seems much interested in what Joe Biden has to say at the moment. I hear he’s starting a podcast.The question of who wins the 2020 election is far from irrelevant, but we are lying to ourselves if we believe that some kind of national savior is going to emerge from the Electoral College. This epidemic is shaking the foundations — it should shake our assumptions, too.Trump or Biden? The virus doesn’t care.Much of the debate about our presidential elections comes down to: “At least my guy isn’t your guy.” (The most insipid sentence in common political circulation is: “Elections are binary.”) One of the many shortcomings of that line of argument is that it sometimes is the case that neither of the two leading candidates is especially fitted to the times and their needs. There are politicos on the Democratic side and the Republican side who might make more plausible leaders during a crisis of this nature: Rick Scott and Michael Bloomberg are two of them. The tribal-mascot mode of presidential politics is, for a certain kind of person, very amusing and exhilarating, and it is good enough, I suppose, for times of relative peace, prosperity, and security. It is not good enough for times of genuine danger when millions of lives and untold trillions in wealth depend upon the competent management of complex problems that cannot be simplified via fiat.How serious is Joe Biden about this kind of thing? Consider his earlier campaign promises: “I promise you, if I’m elected president, you’re going to see the single most important thing that changes America: We’re gonna cure cancer.” Primitive peoples believed that the touch of a king could cure them of leprosy and other illnesses. Perhaps it is the case that Biden, who plagiarized his way through law school at Syracuse, dabbles brilliantly in oncology.Biden proposes to respond decisively with a combination of platitudes (“restoring trust, credibility, and common purpose”), wishful thinking (magicking a vaccine into existence), and memos (“The Biden Plan calls for issuing guidance to states and localities to ensure first responders and public health officials are prioritized to receive protective personal equipment and launching an education campaign to inform the general public about equipment that should be reserved for professionals”).Biden has called for — imagine this! — “a decisive public-health response.”Whatabout-ism is a critique that cuts both ways. Joe Biden is a vain, shallow, dishonest, foolish, self-serving, cynical, exploitative, dim old coot. Those who prefer Biden may insist that Trump is an even more vain, shallow, dishonest, foolish, self-serving, cynical, exploitative, dim, slightly younger coot — <span>NOW WATCH: </span>Perhaps Biden sees himself roughly the same way: He is not Donald Trump, and, in the assessment of most Democratic partisans — and that of a small but non-negligible group of  Americans who are not Democratic partisans but believe that Trump is unsuited to the presidency — that should be enough. Biden can be Not Trump from the comfort of his easy chair — why should the gentleman from Delaware exert himself unnecessarily?If you are in search of an illustrative example for the rhetorical strategy known as “damning with faint praise,” consider Bruni’s assessment of Biden: Given the “unthinkably dire” prospect of Trump’s reelection, Bruni writes, “Biden made as much sense as any other candidate.” Imagine Every day, at the White House briefing about the coronavirus, Donald Trump gets the undivided attention of the media, a national television audience bloated by crisis and as many minutes as he wants to play a “wartime president,” as he grandiosely calls himself. . . . And every day, Joe Biden watches from the far reaches of the upper balcony as he waits and waits to be declared the de facto Democratic presidential nominee and assume leadership of his party.His most prominent recent appearance in the Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee (Senator Bernie Sanders, the socialist from Vermont from Brooklyn, remains in the race) has endured an extended absence from the front pages: In the Has anybody seen Joe Biden?<span class=""drop"">D</span>

No charge.I hope that someday we can look back and say that suffering was worth it — that, on the whole, we came together and made the best of terrible circumstances. But I also hope that we won’t forget the suffering itself — the odiousness of the measures taken, the poisonousness of the mood they put us in — and the fact that only the gravest, most diffuse danger to our very lives could have justified it. These are extremely abnormal times, and when they are gone we should never want them to return.It’s true that nature has no obligation to be compatible with our civilization. And so, to preserve our civilization against cruel storms or a pandemic, extraordinary measures can be justified. But public-health authorities were too slow to take such measures in the present case, which made the suffering they caused once they were taken more acute.  
     
   Of course, one doesn’t even need to resort to a slippery-slope argument to see the combined toll these indignities have taken on our fellow Americans. A friend who is a New York policeman is already seeing and dreading more suicides — jumpers particularly — that he knows must be the result of house arrest in a place such as Manhattan.European countries such as Germany Then, there is the problem of what we do to each other. In Britain there is a reported surge of citizens snitching on each other, self-righteously calling the police to turn in neighbors who exercise outside more than once a day. Tabloid newspapers print large photographs of everyday people shopping and ask their readers if they think the action depicted was really necessary. Police in Darbyshire 
“Lockdown” itself is a word pulled from prison, and implies a kind of universal guilt upon those that Western governments have confined to house arrest. It is all the worse to use this word when it seems the measures it refers to might have been avoided if travel restrictions upon tourists and businessmen who know how to teleconference had been more restrictive earlier on.Governments have been incredibly slow to explain and justify the massive, economically ruinous suppression of normal life undertaken to contain the coronavirus. Without a plan and some public explanation of when people might return to normal life, lockdown becomes an unbearable uncertainty in a free country. We become subject to a kind of ad hoc junta running our lives for the sake of public health and safety, even at the potential cost of a depression that would destroy people’s livelihoods, enterprises, marriages, and homes. If public health is the only thing we can agree on, we are a civilization in name only.But they One can tolerate instructions to stay indoors in an extraordinary public-health emergency, and I have. I believed in and called for schools to be shut in places of outbreak, particularly because young children have the hardest time practicing the stringent hygiene required to prevent the transmission of a flu-like virus. I still believe it was the right call, and think the evidence so far backs it up. Watching the very real strain on New York hospitals seems to confirm the need for such grave measures. At least here.On Sunday, I packed my kids into our minivan and drove down Route 117 in Westchester County. I needed to get out of the house, and my spouse needed a break from the kids. I used bleach wipes to handle the pump at a gas station on the drive. Each town felt hushed, like the Jersey shore in mid-October. Some doors were shuttered, many with handwritten signs about plans to open or operate at reduced hours. Grocers were open, but traffic was eerily light.<span class=""drop"">F</span>

That is exactly what the WHO should be doing; instead, it has undermined global health by carrying water for Beijing. The global coronavirus pandemic is one of the greatest threats the world currently faces. If the WHO cannot return to its true mission, all responsible international actors should come together and consider what is needed to warn the world of emerging pandemics.Despite the CCP’s suppression of information about COVID-19 and the WHO’s breach of public trust, the Taiwanese have seen low rates of infection, thanks in part to clever preventive strategies put in place after the 2002–3 SARS epidemic — another instance in which a virus from China affected Taiwan. This time, Taiwan implemented a raft of rapid emergency measures such as travel bans, quarantines, and strict social distancing.I am confident the world can work together to advance public health. Taiwan represents a model, which other nations should follow, for success outside Beijing-dominated organizations.
Every U.S. administration, Republican and Democratic alike, recognizes the critical value the WHO can play in protecting global health. If, after these steps, the organization demonstrates it is still not up to the task, then the U.S. must lead the world in exploring an alternative multilateral arrangement for global pandemic warning.I will also work with my colleagues in Congress to review U.S. contributions to the WHO. Most of our contributions can be used at the discretion of the WHO leadership. Maintaining current levels of U.S. contributions should depend on whether the WHO can reclaim its independence. First, we need investigations into the WHO’s unacceptably slow decision-making on whether to declare a global pandemic and into how China has compromised the integrity of the WHO. As well, we need accompanying reforms.The world’s leading global health organization cannot be used as a tool of the CCP, and the U.S. — the WHO’s largest financial contributor, giving Examples that could prove fatal are rife. In December, the WHO No, the concern stems from WHO’s current leadership, who have regularly demonstrated their servility to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The latest example comes in the form of a now-viral video interview, in which a WHO senior adviser abruptly ends the interview when asked about Taiwan. Dodging questions about Taiwan to please Beijing isn’t fatal, but it is indicative of a systemic problem within WHO leadership: a subservience to Beijing that comes at the expense of its stated commitment to public health.<span class=""drop"">W</span>

Rowling, who, in conjunction with WizardingWorld.com has launched three new initiatives under “Harry Potter at Home,” to assist teachers and parents now struggling with the task of homeschooling. Rowling, who is estimated to give away approximately 16 percent of her net worth to charity, had said before that: “You have a moral responsibility when you’ve been given far more than you need, to do wise things with it and give intelligently.” But this is as true of a public platform as it is of money. Frankly, the wisest and most intelligent thing these celebrities could do at this point is make a donation and then quietly get on with life, just like everyone else on the planet.Next, hoping to be considered for the role of sacrificial self-isolator, is Sam Smith, a successful young millionaire who, since last year, has been identifying as “non-binary” and requesting that people refer to him as “them.” From inside his $14 million home in London, Smith, suffering from a “headache,” posted a series of photos on Instagram captioned “stages of a quarantine meltdown.” Later, he made an announcement to his “wonderful fans” about his upcoming album, “In a 30+ year military career, including taking part in four major campaigns,” retweeted Adrian Weale, “this is the most horrifying thing I’ve seen.” Quite. Beyond the appalling singing and sanctimony, let’s not overlook the song itself. Lest we forget, first released in 1971, Lennon’s “Imagine” is about the most succinct summary possible of one of the worst political experiments ever tried. The song is, in Lennon’s own words, “virtually the The Queen of Pop is not the only person with a romantic vision to share. Gal Gadot, the 34-year-old Madonna, for instance, in her audition to the world for the role of philosopher-queen, shared her thoughts from a milky bath of rose petals. “The thing about COVID-19,” she said, mesmerizing her audience with a face so tucked and stretched as to look neither young nor old, “it doesn’t care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell.” In this way, the 61-year-old explained, the coronavirus has “made us all equal.” This is a paradox, both “wonderful” and “terrible” at the same time.<span class=""drop"">I</span>

Emergency conditions do not lend themselves to sober deliberation. In any public-safety crisis, government officials occasionally go too far when it comes to restrictions. And we’ve seen disturbing reports of potentially politicized zeal in how state and local governments enforce restrictions — e.g., targeting religious services (including funerals) for violating stay-at-home directives, designating gun shops as “non-essential” businesses that must cease operations, and so on. We are in an environment in which there is apt to be more abuse of state power than usual and fewer available court resources to intervene on behalf of those whose rights have been violated.The courts are not closed. They are operating. People whose rights are arguably being violated by the restrictions that have been imposed, or by the Draconian manner in which those restrictions are sometimes being enforced, have the ability to challenge them in court. People who claim that federal or state governments are wrongly interfering with the rights of citizens to travel interstate (I raise this because some have suggested that the social distancing and quarantine conditions that some state and local authorities have imposed are, in effect, the establishment of martial law. That is not true.Here is the most important thing: The courts are processing arrests and entertaining emergency applications in both civil and criminal cases. If there is some contingency that has to be addressed in the here and now, judges are available to do that.The same is true of civil cases. The vast majority of them are settled without trial. Nothing about the coronavirus emergency stops discovery from proceeding. Social-distancing protocols may complicate depositions a bit but should not prevent them from happening.
Note that the vast majority of criminal cases are resolved by guilty plea (or some form of diversion in which charges are dismissed). This includes many cases in which defendants, who have been arrested on a complaint (rather than an indictment), negotiate a plea agreement without ever being indicted. (In such cases, defendants waive indictment and plead guilty to what’s called a criminal information, filed by the prosecutor.) Nothing about the ongoing emergency prevents plea negotiations from taking place.Grand-jury proceedings are also temporarily adjourned. This means that cases cannot be indicted at the moment. That should be a problem only in investigations involving crimes that are nearing the statute-of-limitations deadline (a tiny fraction of cases), or in cases where grand-jury compulsion is needed to secure the testimony of an essential witness (though prosecutors and government agents can often figure out alternative ways to get such information).To be sure, activities are scaled back significantly. Virtually everything that is unrelated to specific cases is on hold. As for the progress of filed cases, both criminal and civil, many proceedings have been postponed, and tele-conferences have replaced in-court conferences and oral arguments. For the most part, evidentiary hearings and jury trials, which as a practical matter have to take place in court, are not being convened — and will not proceed until the need for extreme distancing has eased. Jury trials that were underway but uncompleted before the preventive measures were imposed have been suspended.As a follow-up, it seems worth looking into the current state of play. I am happy to report that the courts are open, at least for essential business, at both the federal and state level, even in New York, where COVID-19 is taking its worst toll nationally.

No charge.Len Van MaanenThanks for listening, God Bless you and keep you and yours safe in this perilous time,Each of us has, over the course of years spent in this field, memories, good, bad and horrific. One stands out for me. The night of a trailer fire. We got all four patients in via ambulance in less than ten minutes. An adult, followed by three babies, the oldest five years of age. I remember carrying them one at a time, wrapped in white plastic, to the morgue. We were all taking it hard. I had to go to our closet/break room to hang my head and cry a little bit, when our ER doctor put her arm around my shoulder and whispered “at least these kids had someone to make an effort to save them. We were here.” They still are. But now they’re dying. And still they serve.So, if and when we get a handle on the current pandemic crisis, and when the death toll at large, and amongst health care workers is finally tallied, and things “get back to normal,” I only hope that the current respect for those that go into harm’s way won’t dry up and blow away.But, looking back on the past, and now wishing I could help, but being too old and medically unsuitable to do so, I have never been more proud of my wife, my peers and friends with whom I had the privilege to work. We loved each other, supported each other [with no help from our owners and administrators] and dealt with the daily hell with courage, skill, humanity and humor.It is no wonder to me that health care has higher divorce, suicide, substance abuse rates across the board.I am a US Army veteran, and a retired paramedic. I can tell you this. Health care workers deal with unimaginable stress and medical horrors on a daily basis in “good times.” And now add to this the pandemic. And still, they are there. And they deal with the blood and battle on a daily basis for their entire career, day after day. Imagine being in a real war for decades at a time. PTSD? It’s as common as a morning coffee!I can tell you, nobody but my co-workers appreciated me then.I have had patients file false complaints of “rudeness” and even sexual impropriety to “pay me back.” In the early days of HIV, I had a semi-drunk patient, [who faked a suicide attempt in order to get attention from his soon-to-be ex-wife] spit in my eyes, and then giggle while he said “I just got tested for AIDS.” In those days, we could not test the patient without their consent, so it was me who had to be tested for the next six months, basically putting my life on hold for half a year.A nurse in my ER was there when the ambulance brought in a horribly, fatally injured, unidentified, unrecognizable, young teenage girl, only to find out that we were working on, and losing, her daughter.We were there for the complaints about wait times and triage priorities. “Why did that guy get seen before me? I was here first!” “Well, he was dead, and you were constipated!”We were there for a Hepatitis B breakout. An easily communicable, deadly disease. And West Nile, H1N1, Bird Flu, and HIV/AIDS. There for the daily assaults, the drunks, psychos, fakers, wife-beaters, child abusers, horrific traumas and heart attacks.It is “nice” that health care workers nationwide are being shown many words and actions of support…they deserve them. But…they have always been there!Last night we had a bizarre conversation over dinner, as she prepared to go back in to work. We actually made arrangements concerning our dog and cat if and when she brought the Covid19 home, and the high likelihood of my death, and possibly hers, too. Those kids out there who call this pandemic the “Boomer Remover” can have a laugh at my expense, then, I won’t mind.I am a retired health care worker. Thirteen years working in a Detroit area ER, and sixteen years working in the organ donation/transplantation field. My wife [who I met at work!] is a thirty-five year nursing veteran. She currently works in SE MI’s Covid19 hot spot in Oakland County. As of today, they are seeing 20 deaths per day due to the pandemic, and that number will climb, horrendously. And now her co-workers and friends are dying.Dear Mr. Nordlinger, greetings from Michigan.His letter left me with, among other things, a humble awe at what some people are willing to do for others.I received a letter from a reader, Leonard Van Maanen, from my home state of Michigan. It is one of the rawest things I have read in recent weeks, which is saying something. I am going to publish it — with Mr. Van Maanen’s permission — just the way it came in to me, with no editing whatsoever.You will know what I mean when I say, I am all for measured tones and cool heads. I have been alarmed at alarmism, so to speak, my entire life. But there is a time for downplaying and a time for “up-playing,” if you will. In my judgment, this is no time for downplaying.

No charge.Some have argued that the goal of the relief package is to put the economy into a “Put differently, the Paycheck Protection Program pays businesses to maintain their labor demand, while Pandemic Unemployment Assistance pays workers to reduce their labor supply. How the two programs will interact is unclear. Unfortunately, even at $350 billion,   This is the genius behind the relief package’s Liberal and progressive veterans of the Great Recession will likely roll their eyes at this prognosis, thinking I’m some kind of simple-minded supply-sider. Yet my primary concern is about labor demand. Maintaining a formal relationship between employers and their employees, even if they’re furloughed, will be key to ensuring a robust economic rebound. If those relationships are broken, businesses won’t spontaneously raise wages. Rather, they will either close shop or restructure around business models where that labor isn’t demanded in the first place.I personally am uncertain, but a worst-case scenario is easy to imagine: Essential services will go unstaffed, and businesses that would otherwise operate will falter. Some firms will retain workers by raising wages, but most won’t have the extra cash to compete against four months of generous paid leave. Then, once quarantines begin to lift, a fraction of Pandemic UI recipients will choose to stay on “extended benefits” because their former employer has disappeared. Temporary unemployment will become structural, and a jobless recovery will drag out for decades.Even the Left seems to be of two minds. While most are confident that the temporary nature of the benefit will keep employment rates from collapsing, some are rejoicing at “the possibility of millions of low-wage workers rebelling against their employers by quitting for $600/week super-UI,” as It should go without saying that no government in history has ever designed an unemployment-insurance program quite like this — one that virtually anyone can qualify for, and with benefits on par with the Except you And yet there are different ways to achieve this goal, with different risks involved. Graham, for his part, was widely mocked for apparently misunderstanding how unemployment insurance works. After all, you can’t simply quit your job and claim UI, so what’s the risk?
The question remains whether, in the context of a global pandemic, unemployment benefits that pay better than your job should be considered a feature or a bug. To This $600 per week add-on — equivalent to a $15-per-hour full-time income — means that many workers will soon be eligible to receive more in unemployment compensation than they would make on the job. Realizing this, Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) Complicating matters is the fact that public officials are actively trying to discourage work. Take the new For perspective, weekly jobless claims during the Great Recession topped out at only 665,000, with a peak unemployment rate of 10 percent. Jobless claims from just the last two weeks already put us past that. Based on some simple back-of-the-envelope math, an economist at the St. Louis Fed <span class=""drop"">T</span>

Is it too much to ask that we be consistent?Once we’ve gleaned that important information from the article, a question comes to mind: What exactly is this The article goes on to note that the studies show some evidence of transmission, meaning there’s some reason to believe that a fetus — an unborn human being, as some of us call it — could be affected by the disease if his or her mother contracted COVID-19. But it doesn’t seem to pose an enormous risk. That’s one small blessing, as is the fact that, by and large, infants and children seem to have avoided contracting the disease or suffering severe symptoms.Even in these studies, the newborns seemed only mildly affected, if at all — which is reassuring, experts said. And the studies are small and inconclusive on whether the virus does truly breach the placenta.Newborns and babies have so far seemed to be largely unaffected by the coronavirus, but three new studies suggest that the virus may reach the fetus in utero.The National ReviewFollow Us",0,Coronavirus and the Fetus

As we mourn the dead, succor the ill, hunker down in social isolation, and aid the suddenly unemployed, let’s not lose sight of the fact that progress is being made.Is this a “cure?” No. Much more work remains to be done to even get close to saying that.The intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.The scientists’ conclusion about the potential of these stem cells?The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC [Mesenchymal stem cells] transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days.Here’s a small reason for optimism.

But it did cross my mind that if the government is going to rescue an industry, no matter what the circumstances are, over and over again, the incentives for treating your employees and consumers well are reduced.Delta has been charging some customers “cancellation fees” if they want cash back. One customer was offered cash instead of a voucher if the airline kept $200 per international ticket. Another was charged a $150 cancellation penalty after canceling an early April domestic trip online, then told the only way to avoid the fee was to call the airline before canceling.My own dreadful experience with Delta is that the airline refuses to give me a refund and claims it can only give me a credit. Listening to other people, it is apparent that airlines have been blatantly flouting their obligations to return consumer money for services not provided. A few days ago, the If your flight is cancelled and you choose to cancel your trip as a result, you are entitled to a refund for the unused transportation – even for non-refundable tickets.  You are also entitled to a refund for any bag fee that you paid, and any extras you may have purchased, such as a seat assignment.<span style=""font-size: 1.25rem;"">By the way, airlines aren’t very good rule followers to start with.

These employees will be covered for the hours they lost through the expansion of the unemployment benefits under the CARES Act. That will be a surprise, I assume, for those people who favored the bailout to avoid the cost of welfare payments.I assume the thinking behind the act was that those airlines who get a loan can furlough their employees but those to take both a grant and loan shouldn’t. We will see whether the Treasury enforces this or not since the act isn’t clear.I was surprised by this. So I went and looked at the CARES Act and realized that in the loans, loan guarantees, and other investments section, the requirements were — as Leff says above — that “the eligible business shall maintain its employment levels as of March 24, 2020, to the extent practicable, and in any case shall not reduce its employment levels by more than 10 percent from the levels on such date.”The bailout actually does allow an airline to furlough For that reason, many people are willing to overlook their usual objections to bailouts (that (1) refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing pay rates and benefits until September 30, 2020;Congress agreed and offered the $29 billion in grants on the condition that airlines won’t cut compensation or furlough anyone before September 30.

And between 50 and 60 people of the 407 who have tested positive for the coronavirus have recovered and come out of quarantine, he said.In contrast, Bucks County health officials reported an overall decrease in the spread of the coronavirus, although most such cases are doctors, nurses, first responders, store workers, and other essential workers serving the community.<a href=""https://www.inquirer.com/news/coronavirus-covid-19-pa-new-jersey-hospitals-death-toll-free-food-philadelphia-20200402.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Meanwhile, there’s been a decline in the number of cases in Bucks County, Pa.:</a>You’re starting to hear cautious optimism that the ramped-up hospital capacity will be sufficient The city pays the hotels and FEMA reimburses the city; this might help keep these hotels afloat at a time when there are no tourists.“We are in disaster mode so that contracts can be quickly signed. When it’s operational, patients who don’t need to be incubated, who are recovering but not well enough to leave the hospital, will be sent to hotels,” Katz said.Dr. Mitchell Katz, CEO of NYC Health + Hospitals, said Wednesday that the city’s current state of emergency has allowed officials to fast-track contracts with hotels. Workers will move into convert floors of rooms into hospital wings, build out nursing stations, and outfit rooms to house patients who are in need of medical care.The coronavirus and the resulting shutdowns are brutal on the hotel industry — but in New York City, “What I’m hearing from hospitals is one hospital might be in need of masks and one hospital might be in need of gowns, and so we’re starting to do some matchmaking (to) create a little bit of an ad hoc marketplace so that people can trade supplies,” Atlas said.Equipment is in short supply across the country. Atlas said they’re getting concerned about a shortage of ventilators as some hospitals are already at their limit. Personal protective equipment is also a concern.“I wouldn’t say any hospital is at all overwhelmed, nothing like New York at this point,” Atlas said. “Probably the biggest area of need is staffing. It’s hard to flex, and there’s a limited supply. Everyone is looking everywhere they can. The governor’s executive orders have made it so that retirees, people with expired licenses can come back into service.”Maryland is seeing an increasing number of cases of the coronavirus.

The state also bought 500 ventilators.Regarding the supply of ventilators, state officials say there are 1,000 intensive care unit ventilators in Washington hospitals and around 50 ventilators in ambulatory surgical facilities.“We still have capacities at our hospitals, we are not overwhelmed. That is very different from what you are seeing in New York,” said Cassie Sauer, CEO of the Washington State Hospital Association.The coronavirus response in Washington State isn’t getting nearly enough attention. The state that had the first coronavirus case in the U.S. now ranks tenth in total cases, with 6,585 as of this writing, and 272 deaths. Credit the early application of social distancing, and I’ve heard some people speculate this reflects that people in the Pacific Northwest aren’t quite as touchy-feely and social as other parts of the country. State officials are preparing to shift patients with more limited clinical needs from existing hospitals to the new “field medical station” set up by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the Meadowlands in order to make room for individuals who need critical care; the field station, in Secaucus, is expected to start accepting patients Monday. Newark’s University Hospital, the region’s Level 1 trauma center, will oversee the field station and transport the patients by ambulance or air, if needed.After weeks of planning and preparations, New Jersey is now ready to activate its hospital-capacity contingency plans, as facilities in the northern counties are becoming increasingly overwhelmed by a surge of patients with COVID-19.<a href=""https://www.insidesources.com/unexpected-consequence-of-covid-19-crisis-empty-emergency-rooms/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">New Jersey says its surge capacity is now ready to go:</a>The The By no stretch of the imagination are we anywhere near “out of the woods” yet.

And now, bit by bit, parts of the country are starting to think they are, if not fully prepared for any wave, much better equipped than even a week ago.<strong>When Americans Need to Act Fast, They Can Move Like Lightning</strong>It’s Friday — although I know it’s getting harder and harder to tell these days.

					© 2020 National Review				Our Capital Letter email newsletter delivers a weekly digest on finance, business, and economics from an NR sensibility.When a super-spreader is boarding a flight from Wuhan to New York, there’s no time to run a regression. As Clausewitz said of war, “in the course of action, circumstances press for immediate decision, and allow no time to look about for fresh data.”Trump himself is hardly an intellectual, but policy responses across the West — from the U.S. to the U.K. to France — have arguably been   
     
   Along with Forceful preemptive measures to combat the coronavirus would have required an intuitive understanding of the strategic terrain — not only of the risks and rewards of various policies, but also of public sentiment. The German war scholar Carl von Clausewitz called it On the policy front, dependence on experts delayed the domestic response to COVID-19. While the coronavirus spread through China, policymakers in the U.S. could not possibly discern the likelihood of a domestic outbreak. Prior experiences with SARS, Ebola, and swine flu indicated that the U.S. was resilient in the face of pandemics. In retrospect, it’s easy to identify why that wasn’t the case with the novel coronavirus, but it wasn’t at all clear at the time. The hard sciences are empirical, requiring careful observation of phenomena over long periods of time. Unlike “experts,” political leaders must act preemptively in the face of uncertainty. If policy is “data driven,” without data, there’s no one at the wheel.
In the West, overreliance on expertise Delaying the elections would have had massive drawbacks too, of course, but that’s the point: No amount of “evidence-based” policymaking can provide an easy path through predicaments in which the choices on offer all promise uncertain outcomes. While the nations of Southeast Asia have tempered the pandemic with “test-and-trace” strategies, their success is more a result of firsthand experience with the 2003 SARS outbreak than of superior scientific capabilities. Widespread use of face masks in South Korea, Japan, and Singapore prior to the pandemic also protected those populations. Thus, decidedly unscientific factors — lived experience, cultural mores — have trumped technical prowess in the fight against this pandemic.While scientists will ultimately have to address the underlying threat of the disease itself, they cannot solve the immediate problem of mobilizing the country against the virus. The expert fetishists should consider the lackluster response of French president Emmanuel Macron, Europe’s arch-technocrat, whose decision to hold elections during the outbreak doubtlessly increased the number of infections in his country. In contrast with Trump, Macron surrounds himself with a coterie of technicians providing the precise policy prescriptions for any given moment, yet he and Trump came to roughly the same conclusion.While some epidemiologists have used previous flu pandemics to inform their thinking, that approach requires rough estimates of factors such as reproduction and fatality rates, leading to wide variance in projections. To take one example, Oxford University researchers found that as much as 40 percent of the U.K. might be immune to the novel coronavirus, while a team from Imperial College London projected more than 250,000 domestic deaths, even under strict social-distancing measures. For all their sophistication, computational tools For one, a monolithic expert opinion on the present pandemic does not exist. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, emerged only three months ago; scientists haven’t had nearly enough time to conduct conclusive research into it. And constraints on testing, compounded by uncertainty as to the number of asymptomatic cases, make the current medical data largely unreliable.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

Fortunately, the stakes are not as high as in ’56. There are no tanks on the streets, and Hungarian democracy is not a lost cause. But even in the midst of a global pandemic, it is time for other liberal democracies to stand up, both for Hungary’s sake and for Europe’s.Promoting liberal democracy is an unfashionable cause of late, but Hungary is worth fighting for. In the dark days of the Cold War, 
On April 1, after Parliament granted Orban the power to rule by decree, several EU governments released In recent years the EU’s response to Orban has been either too weak or too broad. In 2018 the much-heralded Sargentini report on Hungary was presented to the European Parliament. The report, authored by a Dutch Green Party MP, included many legitimate complaints about the erosion of civil liberties and corruption, but it also took Hungary to task for its gender inequality, the inadequacy of its old-age pensions, and its failure to adopt same-sex marriage. It is hardly surprising that Hungarians were not interested in being lectured by a left-wing EU functionary about gender roles.The signal fact about soft authoritarianism is that it is soft, and therefore amenable to change. Crudely lumping Orban in with hardline autocrats implies that Hungary’s democratic backsliding is hopeless and irreversible. It would be better to recognize that the coronavirus is an unprecedented emergency and that ill-considered emergency powers may yet be relinquished.Orban is sometimes compared to the likes of Putin or Xi Jinping. This is badly mistaken. Even after his assumption of broad emergency powers, the prime minister is best understood as the latest in a line of Hungarian leaders who have uncomfortably straddled liberalism and authoritarianism. During the late Soviet period, Hungary under Janos Kadar was known as “the happiest barracks in the Eastern bloc,” a relatively relaxed socialist alternative to the grim regimes of East Germany or Romania. Before World War II, the country was ruled by Admiral Miklos Horthy, a right-wing autocrat who nevertheless presided over parliamentary elections.Now, however, the Hungarian government’s heavy-handed response to the coronavirus threatens to vindicate Orban’s critics. On March 30, the Hungarian Parliament passed emergency legislation that allows Orban to indefinitely govern by decree and threatens jail time for anyone spreading false or misleading information about the pandemic. Technically, Parliament can revoke this extraordinary grant of power with another vote, but Orban’s Fidesz party controls an overwhelming legislative majority.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

No charge.Well, Anne, are you feeling lucky?If Orban doesn’t close down the state of emergency within a few days of Boris Johnson doing so, Kalnoky will pay out a bottle of Borsodi beer to whoever takes the bet. If Orban does end the emergency, Kalnoky gets the beer. I wouldn’t take that bet. If Anne Applebaum believes her dictator view of Orban, she should.Boris Kalnoky of Now, I don’t think that will happen. It’s not in Orban’s interest now or later. First, the mere existence of emergency powers is fueling the epidemic of hysteria toward him in the international media. Extending them would make it a pandemic. Second, the constitutional lawyers point out that there is a sunset clause already, but it’s in the Constitution that governs the “state of danger” rather than in the emergency powers themselves. This says that when the danger (i.e., the epidemic) ends, government decrees made under the emergency become invalid. Any attempt by the government to ignore this provision would certainly be appealed to the court which just as certainly would find against the government. And, third, why would Orban risk the obloquy that this dispute would call down on his head? His government already has a two-thirds parliamentary majority that enables him to do almost anything he wants within the law and constitution. A sunset clause wouldn’t remove that practical power, but it would dramatize his commitment to returning to regular constitutional government.Other wartime powers were expressed to continue until the government declared the war to be over, which it never did. They continued to be used until the 1980s, when the Scott report exposed this unsatisfactory corner of governmental practice.Governments armed with vast powers are usually reluctant to part with them. The wartime defence regulations, which required the population to “place themselves, their services and their property at the disposal of His Majesty,” had to be renewed annually but were not allowed to expire until 1964.I don’t draw the conclusion, however, that this means we needn’t worry about the lack of a sunset clause. The longer emergency powers remain on the books, the more tempting it might be for Orban’s government — or any government — to keep them there. As Sumption (finally) points out:How does Hungary compare on that criterion? So far, though Viktor Orban has equipped his government with strong emergency powers, it doesn’t look as if they are being abused at ground level. There is no heavy-handedness on the streets of Budapest. Having enjoyed exercise walks around the city for the past two weeks, I can say two things: the first is that the people of the city are generally staying home (the streets are far less crowded than usual) but that when they go out, they keep the rules like Germans. They take a wide berth when they walk past you, and they keep six meters distant in groceries and pharmacies (which sometimes admit only two people at a time). Maybe that’s why the police are able to interpret their duties in a very relaxed way. There is none of the officious behavior of the British police nor the aggressive tactics of the French. That may change, but that’s how it is now.These are not just technicalities. There is a difference between law and official instructions. It is the difference between a democracy and a police state. Liberty and the rule of law are surely worth something even in the face of a pandemic.It is Britain that has provided the most alarming picture. In a number of instances, the police have gone well beyond their powers to enforce social distancing and home isolation. In Derbyshire they dyed a lake dark blue in order to discourage urban drivers from visiting it. They have taken to stopping cars at random to inquire if their drivers had a legitimate reason for being out. They told a shopkeeper not to sell Easter eggs on the grounds that they weren’t essential goods. And they forbade a Labour MP from visiting his father — Lord Kinnock, a former Labour leader and EU commissioner — to celebrate his birthday. (His son went anyway.) None of these interventions have any basis in the emergency legislation. They originate from an often neglected streak in the respectable side of the British character, which is a “bossiness” that, though usually held in check by sensible rules and the mockery of others, has been encouraged to express itself by the ruling atmosphere of panic. It has even spread to the nervous libertarian in Downing Street. As Lord Sumption pointed out in his Germany is entering the “repressive” stage of the coronavirus response quite late and in a less panicked public mood than others because its efficient and wide testing for the virus has held down the number of fatalities to low levels compared with its neighbors. If that changes, which it probably won’t, then both public and official attitudes may harden. So far, however, the German public has been self-disciplined and the police wonderful.Not perhaps in the case of France, which has a strong record of deference to executive power. On this occasion the rules are both intrusive and firmly enforced. Violators of the household curfew are punished with fines and imprisonment — 9,000 fines were issued in the first few days. Gendarmes demand official proof of a right to leave the home for those found in the streets — it can be downloaded from a government website. They have been seen physically forcing people back into their homes if they don’t have them. And officials have drawn up a list of exercises approved by the state as legitimate reasons for leaving home. So tough restrictions are being firmly enforced.When we compare the Hungarian state of emergency with these three responses on paper, the differences between them seem formal and extremely modest. France’s state of emergency must be renewed every twelve days, for instance, whereas Hungary’s has no time limit. But the last state of emergency in France lasted two years — 2015 to 2017. So how these governments actually implement their wide-ranging powers matters as much as, maybe more than, paper distinctions. And here the record is illuminating and sometimes surprising.  
   Like Chancellor Merkel, the U.K. government has not brought in a formal state of emergency, but it has imposed a lockdown, quarantine, and most of the other restrictions through “emergency” coronavirus legislation passed by Parliament. Boris Johnson, a temperamental libertarian, seems to have been pushed into doing so by a panicked public opinion and a Labour Party keener on restrictions than he was. The law gives the government “unprecedented powers” over a wide range of issues — ministers can “rule by decree” despite lacking a formal  declaration of emergency — and it now runs for one year with a provision for MPs to debate its workings every six months. After passing the legislation, however, Parliament left for a month, in part because MPs didn’t want to catch the virus in the crowded chamber.France has a state of emergency that lasts for twelve days and which can be repeatedly reimposed. Regulations under it are tougher and more intrusive than under earlier emergencies: People have to stay in their homes except for essential visits outside such as medical appointments or physical exercise.Merkel’s government may be preparing a state of emergency to loosen restraints on state spending, which in Germany would be a very big deal. Even if she doesn’t go ahead with that, however, she has already imposed most of the restrictions familiar from other countries — a ban on gatherings, reimposing borders, curfews, etc. — under the wide-ranging Infection Protection Act. In addition to these civil restrictions, as That would seem to be some sort of defense for the Hungarian state of emergency, but Ms. Applebaum has already erected a defense against that defense in her first tweet. She mentioned “Whataboutism” as one of the justifications Rod Dreher and I might use for the legislation. She’s implying that such a response would be an irrelevant distraction from Orban’s dictatorial power grab almost as if European countries such as France, Britain, and Germany were not an appropriate standard by which to judge Hungary’s rules on executive power and individual rights. She’s wise to be cautious, because here are a few comparisons.  
   There are alternative plans, of course. Sweden is using one. But they seem to involve heavier risks to life at an earlier stage than the lockdown strategy. That is why most governments have passed either states of emergency or “emergency” laws written in very similar terms. They fear they may be faced by the combination of a continuing pandemic and a growing economic recession, and they want to be able to act quickly and decisively for a limited period to deal with the difficulties — rumors fueling mass panic, the premature breakdown of curfews — this may generate.
I’m also perplexed when Ms. Applebaum writes that “none of these powers is needed to fight the virus” and that they’re in the legislation to confuse the opposition because the Hungarian government has “no better plan.” Is that true? After all, it has more or less the same plan as most European governments — social distancing, lockdown, quarantine, extreme hygienic care when meeting people, and so on — and these regulations are a direct attempt to halt the spread of the virus. The most draconian loss of freedom under the emergency — requiring people to stay at home except for exercise and shopping — is the same in those countries. If that strategy were to “fail,” i.e., be abandoned because its costs proved too high economically and humanely, Hungary would then doubtless be in trouble, but so would most every other country.I wonder if Ms. Applebaum knows what’s in the legislation. She attaches her tweet approvingly to another by Balasz Cseko to the effect that Parliament has been suspended, elections canceled, and that Viktor Orban will now rule by decree. In fact, far from suspending Parliament, the emergency legislation keeps it in place and gives it, alongside the constitutional court, greater oversight powers over the government’s conduct throughout the emergency. Nor will local and parliamentary elections be canceled. It would hardly matter if they were, anyway, since the next parliamentary elections are not due for another two years, the next local elections for another five, and the epidemic is unlikely to last so long as to exhaust either period. I imagine the claim refers to by-elections in constituencies that become vacant through death or resignation. These are indeed banned during the state of emergency for the eminently practical reason that there can be no campaigning or even voting when people are prohibited from gathering in large groups or lining up closer than six meters to cast their ballots. It is the third claim that’s most extraordinary, however. I magnanimously concede that the Orban government will rule by decree in this time because a “state of emergency” is the term of art for a government ruling by decree. Macron is already ruling by decree, and both Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel are doing the same in effect, through primary and secondary legislation.And there it is: The European Union’s first dictatorship. None of these powers is needed to fight the virus. But they will help distract and deter opposition, especially when it becomes clear that the government has no better plan.The best example of this is Ms. Applebaum’s second tweet:What difference would a sunset clause make? It would warn ministers that they have power and time — but limited time — to reach prudently considered decisions; it would reassure everyone else that this extraordinary period will end at a known and certain point; and it would therefore lower the political temperature on all sides. My second reason is that without such a clause, the state of emergency risks being self-destructive for the Orban government and therefore damaging to its COVID-19 strategy. Far from strengthening the government, a state of emergency with no time limit is likely to weaken ministers by enabling their opponents at home and abroad to paint everything they do as a power grab.Public pressure for action at whatever cost pushes the measures beyond what they can realistically expect to achieve. It may well push them beyond what is worth achieving if the price is the destruction of our personal liberty, livelihoods and sociability. There are dissenting voices, but not many and they are drowned out in a torrent of collective emotion and abuse.My principal reason for wanting a sunset clause arises from a liberal desire to protect people’s liberties against over-broad interpretation of emergency prohibitions by over-zealous public officials who themselves feel the hot breath of a public panic at their back. At present the coronavirus panic is raging throughout the whole of Europe and driving governments to make major decisions on health, economics, and the relationship between them, under pressure. Here’s how Lord Sumption, a former justice of the U.K. Supreme Court, described the situation in The tests are those most people would impose. Is this emergency law within the constitution or a violation of it? And there’s no doubt that it’s constitutional. It was passed by the super-majority that such a law requires. Are there safeguards in it? There are two. First, the constitutional court could reject it in whole or in part, either today or after the epidemic has receded. That is unlikely since all the required constitutional procedures were fulfilled in its passage, but constitutional courts are unpredictable. The second is that Parliament can vote to end the state of emergency at any time by the same two-thirds majority by which it passed the law. I would not entirely rule out that happening if the Orban government were to abuse these powers, but I judge both serious abuse and a parliamentary rebellion against it to be unlikely. Third, are the emergency powers granted to the government too broad? Some of them may be. The fines and prison sentences for breaking quarantine and spreading false rumors, though not unreasonable in themselves when panic and plague are in the air (the latter quite literally), look to me to be too high. But those sentences won’t be imposed arbitrarily; courts will determine them; and the terms of the legislation are tightly written to prevent its being used for political censorship or anything unrelated to the pandemic. So I would urge moderation on the courts and government, and leave it at that. Finally, shouldn’t the legislation have a sunset clause — say of one year on the British model — rather than staying in force indefinitely or until ministers judge the epidemic to be over? And there I think that it should.As an old classical liberal of a conservative disposition, I accept there will be occasions when a crisis is so severe that a government needs emergency powers to deal with it outside the regular law. The coronavirus threat is plainly such a challenge. If a law granting emergency powers to the government to deal with it is proposed, however, I would submit it to certain tests before supporting it.I don’t justify the emergency law as it stands.As Ms. Applebaum has pointed out in <span class=""drop"">I</span>

No charge.<em>Bucknell University’s Michael Malarkey contributed research to this opinion piece.</em>Has President Trump’s response been perfect? Has anyone’s?COVID-19 struck Earth like an invisible asteroid. Nearly everyone has scrambled to defeat something absent since 1918’s Spanish Flu pandemic — 102 years ago. Acting legend Kirk Douglas survived that tragedy. Alas, he died on February 5, at age 103, and no longer offer his insights.Instead, country after country has called in sick, closed its doors, and commenced prayer. If Trump got anything wrong, so did most nations and leaders, including some whom the Left adores.Furthermore, the Left’s “Trump blew it” narrative would ring true if the rest of the planet were healthy, open for business, and shocked at how badly the ailing, dying Yanks botched it, while everybody else aced it.While Democrats conducted Trump’s Senate impeachment trial, he chaired a White House meeting of his Coronavirus Task Force and made his most important decision in this crisis: He barred aliens who had been in China within 14 days of attempted arrival. Trump did this on January 31, President Trump has worked tirelessly and creatively with a diligent team, all confronting an unseen and unexpected enemy. So far, one can infer from these data that their results have left Americans healthier than the citizens of numerous major nations.President Trump’s response, to date, resembles neither Dr. Jonas Salk nor the Grim Reaper. America has steered clear of the top 10 in terms of COVID-19 cases and deaths, although its recovery numbers could be higher. Among the G7, the US is right in the middle of the pact for cases and deaths, and just behind that center spot for recoveries.Regarding recoveries, America’s spot (No. 13) is unenviable, although Sweden (15), Norway (19), and Brazil (20) have done worse. That said, some better performers were hit early, including South Korea (No. 9) and China (10), or hard, such as Spain (1) and Italy (3).Among fatalities, the U.K. — home of the National Health Service — (No. 7), Sweden (9), and Portugal (10) have endured more deaths/million than America has (12). But Norway (No. 14), South Korea (16), and Israel (17) are less toxic.  
   Weighing COVID-19 cases, these data identify modern, prosperous, non-MAGA Switzerland, Spain, and Italy, and liberal favorites Belgium (No. 5), France (7), and the Netherlands (10) as nations with less attractive results than America’s (12). Conversely, Sweden (No. 14), Canada (16), and Turkey (18) enjoy better scores than America’s.With these data subject to those words of caution, it’s fair to say that at this moment, they suggest that President Trump’s leadership of America’s COVID-19 response is not the immaculate CDC clean room that his fans envision. But it’s also neither the festering Petri dish nor the death row of which Trump’s foes scream.  
   Fourth, until Pfizer invents the omniscience pill, mankind operates in a world of incomplete information of mixed quality. Some conclusions are clearer than others (e.g. “I count precisely four oranges on the kitchen table, and they look like about six ounces each”). And inferences are exactly that: inferences.Third, these nations were not all afflicted at once. Instead, this rolling plague has battered different countries at various times, like a bizarre, macabre track race in which various runners react to staggered starter pistols. This highly dynamic plague frustrates comparisons across countries.Second, some of these data may be totally false or merely unreliable. To be charitable, China’s and Iran’s statistics may be the work of censors rather than scientists. Elsewhere, honest countries are cautious and meticulous. Others are equally genuine, but casually phone in figures that are good enough for government work.First, this is just a snapshot. Unlike a staged family portrait, this picture was taken at one moment during an unprecedented, swiftly changing, and incredibly complex global catastrophe. Another snapshot taken in three days, a fortnight, or on July 4 could look completely different.These numbers come with several significant caveats.(For further details, please consult the interactive spreadsheet linked How has the United States fared among the G7 industrialized nations? Placed beside Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, America ranks fourth for cases per million (651), fourth for deaths (15), and fifth for recoveries (26). The category leaders are Italy with 1,772 cases per million, Germany (973), and France (920). Deaths: Italy with 211 per million, France (64), and the UK (36). Recoveries: Italy with 270 per million, Germany (233), and France (176).On a cheerier note, what about those who regained their health? America is now No. 13, with 26 recoveries per million. The top three such countries are Spain, with 453 per million, Switzerland (353), and Italy (270).Concerning fatalities, among these top 20, America is also No. 12, with 15.3 deaths per million. The three leading countries by this grim yardstick: Italy, with 211 per million, Spain (188), and Belgium (71). COVID-19 deaths skew older and male. These data, alas, do not address these variables.Among the top-20 nations in the Johns Hopkins’ ranking by total cases, America is No. 12, with 651 cases per million inhabitants. The top three countries, by this criterion, are Switzerland, with 2,114 per million, Spain (2,082), and Italy (1,772).
Social scientists would gauge these disparate figures as they would evaluate nations along other key metrics, such as GDP: on a per capita basis. Using Johns Hopkins’ priceless and highly televised As of Wednesday, April 1 at 11:53 Not to be outdone, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) sank to new depths on CNN last Sunday, when she basically accused President Trump of negligent homicide: “As the president fiddles, <em>Time </em>According to Senator Bernie Sanders (Socialist, Vt.), “the current administration is largely incompetent, and its incompetence and recklessness has [sic] <span class=""drop""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">‘</span>T</span>

No charge.Predictions are a perilous business for any pundit, and much of what both liberals and conservatives published and broadcast about the coronavirus in the weeks leading up to the middle of March turned out to be wrong. Both sides made these mistakes not out of a willful desire to mislead but because they knew little about the subject, much of what they did know was wrong, and they were, as is their deeply ingrained habit, apt to interpret the latest developments as confirmation of their preexisting political biases. Neither side should now attempt to rewrite history so it casts all the blame for those early failures on the other.  
   The bottom line is that the And even at that late date some of the Manjoo at least had something to say about the virus early on, however wrong it turned out to be. The other 15 op-ed columnists employed by the paper that would subsequently excoriate conservatives for their lack of early alarm remained completely silent until almost the end of February. After January 29, the virus wasn’t mentioned in the To be totally fair to myself, my reasoning To his credit, Manjoo eventually walked this back in a column published on Feb. 26. But the qualifying excuses he offered with mea culpa could just as easily be used to justify similar mistakes made by right-wingers:Like many on the right whom Peters singles out, Manjoo compared the virus to the flu and other diseases that didn’t pose such a catastrophic danger to American society. He claimed that, “fear of a vague and terrifying new illness might spiral into panic, and that it might be used to justify unnecessarily severe limits on movement and on civil liberties, especially of racial and religious minorities around the world. . . . We should keep this sense of caution in mind in case American politicians begin pushing for travel bans, overbroad quarantines or other measures that might not be supported by the science.”The Though Peters’s article complains that right-wing pundits remained insufficiently alarmed about the virus throughout February, the To its credit, the administration has managed to keep some of the world’s leading infectious disease experts in key roles at top agencies, including the C.D.C., the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. If those professionals are given the resources and authority to respond to the crisis as their experience and the science dictate . . . the worst-case scenarios may yet be averted.The first mention of the virus in the Peters can point to instances throughout the following weeks in which Fox News personalities, Limbaugh, and others on the right pooh-poohed the coronavirus as no more dangerous than the seasonal flu, highlighted those who survived the disease, and accused the media of trying to perpetuate a “hoax” against Trump. But a detailed look at what the Meanwhile, on January 31, the The same intellectual reflex motivated politicians such as New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and his health commissioner, Oxiris Barbot, to spend February and part of March dismissing the pandemic. They urged New Yorkers to disregard any fears about the virus and attend the Chinese New Year celebrations and parade in New York’s Chinatown. House speaker Nancy Pelosi did the same thing while promoting the Chinese New Year festivities held in her native San Francisco’s Chinatown. In retrospect, such advocacy is hard to defend given the likelihood that the virus was already starting to spread. But at the time, the looming danger wasn’t yet clear, so the political needs of the moment took precedence.On February 5, the Peters notes that although some at Fox News mocked the idea of being afraid of the virus, others such as Tucker Carlson were touting the coronavirus as a threat in late January, specifically as justification for Trump’s order limiting flights from China. While Carlson and a guest, Senator Tom Cotton (R. Ark.), were, according to the But the underlying assumption of Peters’s thesis is that conservatives were alone in making these errors, and that assumption doesn’t hold up. Liberal media outlets, very much including the 
As There’s no denying that many conservatives were slow to realize the danger posed by the coronavirus, and stuck to talking points about its being no worse than the flu right up until the point in mid-March when it became apparent that we were facing a full-blown public-health disaster. Their knee-jerk reaction to the first calls for action on the issue from the White House was to assume Trump was covering his political bases rather than attempting to forestall a real emergency. And many of them saw panic over the virus as a liberal plot to establish a Hurricane Katrina-style narrative in which Trump would be declared to have been derelict in his duty.A As the present crisis has developed over the past few weeks, the chattering classes have kept busy interpreting everything that happens through pro-Trump and anti-Trump prisms. Many in the mainstream liberal media are intent on settling scores with Trump’s cheerleaders in the conservative media, whom they have accused of fueling skepticism about the danger posed by the coronavirus. Yet in doing so, they are ignoring the fact that many on the left were just as confused about the pandemic at its start and just as eager to play politics with it as their favorite villains on the right.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

How about it?I think arrangements like this could be had in other congregations where there exists a similar desire for access to a sanctuary.In any case, I think it should be possible for many Catholic churches to allow adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and devotions like the Stations of the Cross in a way that conforms with public health advice. Volunteers — there should be many of them now — can be stationed at the front entrance, giving people hand sanitizer, or even masks if available. Perhaps a dozen or more “seats” can be marked in pews with tape. The volunteers can make sure that people coming in sit in marked spots and no more than that minimal number is allowed in. They could regularly disinfect the areas designated for seating.Most Catholic diocese have closed Mass to the public, although many bishops phrased it as “canceling” Mass. One hopes that the sacrifice is still offered even if congregants are not present.In most states, marijuana dispensaries are considered essential services, but churches, synagogues, and mosques are not.

Part Two: <strong><em>A Dios</em></strong>Faulkner revealed his conservative vision in novels like Faulkner believed in the “enduring moral order,” that Kirk put first in his list of principles, and in Kirk’s tenth tenet: reconciling permanence and change. Faulkner’s famous Nobel Prize speech affirmed that only the “old universal truths” counted: “love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice.” These words about human persistence can be found in his letters as well as in his World War II epic screenplay, the unproduced Russell Kirk’s Ten Conservative Principles reflect the way William Faulkner wrote, acted, and organized his life. As a property owner with notions of limited government, he brought that orientation to his fiction, to his work in Hollywood, to his commentary on civil rights, and to his everyday relationships with his family and community. His conservatism was not that of a party or movement but rather expressed what Kirk calls “a state of mind, a type of character, a way of looking at the civil social order.”BONUS: At Indeed, as Richard Florida Even without government assistance, and often in the face of opposition from planners, dispersion has continued to characterize Western cities.

It is unknown how many people were infected by the coronavirus as a result of the rallies.A class action lawsuit filed on March 19 accuses the Spanish government — highly ideological by any standard, as the Communist coalition partner, Podemos, was The Spanish government, comprised of a coalition of Socialists and Communists, is facing legal action for alleged negligence in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

At Gatestone Institute, Soeren Kern reveals how Spain’s hellbent leftist government took actions that brought about coronavirus chaos. Meanwhile, as China is trying to present itself as a In spite of the news that all is well, we have seen evidence that should arouse our suspicions at the least: Leave aside China’s obvious incentive to deceive in the face of a public heath disaster, given its desire to be the global hegemon and need to project competence. Set aside China’s We pay a real price for such apparent useful idiocy because, while the WHO gives China its imprimatur, evidence continues to mount of China’s malign role in every aspect of this pandemic. While the WHO praises China’s response to the crisis, and China cites dwindling numbers of new coronavirus cases, there are any number of reasons to be incredibly skeptical of this data.4. At Yet WHO refers to the West Bank and Gaza as “Occupied Palestinian territory.” Anyone ever ask the Israelis if they feel stigmatized or endangered when the world’s premier health authority lends its imprimatur to such a politicized name?Or take the World Health Organization, which prides itself on objectivity and professionalism. In 2015, WHO updated its best practices for naming new infectious diseases. The aim is to prevent a name from “stigmatizing” any particular community or country, and thus avoid negative implications for everything from trade and tourism to violence.According to Ditto for Harvard. Remember, the chief argument against “the China virus” is that using it stigmatizes both China and people of Chinese descent. But what about the stigmas that come from the subjective “personal ratings” Harvard applies in its admissions process? The Justice Department If someone fuels bigotry by calling a virus a name accurately derived from its geographic origins, what about a mayor who works overtime to reduce the number of Asian-Americans in his city’s most competitive public high schools, not because they haven’t earned their entry but because they aren’t the right race.3. At theBut the success of that postwar patchwork was always overstated, and one should be cautious in using that as an example of how conservatism should conduct itself today.  There is perhaps a reasonable argument that government is smaller than it would have been had liberals won in 1980 or 1988, but one cannot argue that government is small as such or that its power has not grown to levels unimaginable to 1950s or 1960s conservatives (or liberals for that matter).  But it is almost impossible to argue that culturally America is a more conservative place, in almost any sense of the term, than it was in 1980, which is simply a crushing blow to large parts of the conservative intellectual project. The progressive left has essentially won the culture war, although that victory was only cemented when corporations began (as Timothy Crimmins So in different ways, conservatives have been trying to patch themselves up again for the better part of three decades. Even in the wake of Trump, traces of the old Reaganism survive.  Some Roger Scruton in 2. More Now, an observation that is so elementary that it requires neither a telescope nor a microscope allows one to see that Islam, in the diversity of its versions and expressions, has been animated the past fifty years by powerful movements that have transformed the Muslim world and exercise a rather forceful pressure on certain parts of the non-Muslim world. Whether one takes note of the Iranian revolution, Turkey’s ambitions, the Gulf countries’ ability to influence affairs, or the migratory waves headed toward Europe, everything indicates that Islam is in a period of expansion. Now, people will reproach me for unforgiveable naivété in bringing these different phenomena together and placing them under the common heading of “Islam.” However, the political perspective is indeed “naive,” because it believes what it sees, and what it sees is first of all the strength and direction of human associations. For the one with open eyes, it is impossible not to see that the Muslim world exercises an ever increasing pressure on a Europe that, for its part, is so weak that it makes it a point of honor of defining itself by indefinite openness to what is outside itself.We thus suppose that the liberal and secular arrangements that we subscribe to are both universal and irresistible. What we think that we must and can do, determines what we believe we see or can see. Therefore, desiring an Islam amenable to our secularism, we refuse to seriously consider Islam itself, to take the measure of the amplitude, profundity, vitality, and perseverance of this great religious, social and political fact. Analyzing it under the twin criteria of the archaic and the modern, criteria which Europeans present as the sole criterion of the true, the good, and the beautiful, from the outset we deprive the great Muslim fact of its specific force and power. We prefer to postulate that secularism, radically separating religion and politics, will guarantee that the presence of Muslims among us will change nothing substantial in our common life. In short, while we hold that Muslims are our fellow citizens and equals, they do not truly exist as social beings and as a political factor in our national life.Now, Islam comes to us as a form of life, at once individual and collective, one that has strongly etched features, to be sure with its own internal diversity, but which by embracing in principle all the aspects of life and the entirety of the social body, largely ignores the separations which are so dear to us between the public and the private, the religious and the political. While we oblige ourselves to relativize and present our “identities” (in the plural) with irony, Islam distinguishes itself among us by a compact identity that excludes irony and rejects all criticism. Confronted with this, we have decided that we will be ironists and relativists on their behalf. By boldly bringing Islam into the liberal secular arrangement, we gently, but irresistibly, will induce Muslims to take up toward their way of life and belief the distance that we congratulate ourselves for having taken toward our own way for such a long time now. In so doing, however, at the same time that we extol human equality and similarity, we look at Islam from above, not as a false religion or a less accomplished civilization, to be sure, but as a form of common life whose naive absolutism will soon be decisively moderated under the emancipatory effects of our liberty and our secularism (the much vaunted 1.

She drew portraits of them all. But no life to her was more fascinating, and perhaps more revealing, than that of Whittaker Chambers (1901–1961), the Communist, later ex-Communist, informer whose testimony sealed the doom of Alger Hiss. It was in the conduct and words of Chambers that West found a source of longing for Communism that transcended Chambers himself. The context of her discovery was a trial and a book that caused a sensation in early Cold War America.In articles, book chapters, and book reviews spanning six decades, she returned to the allure of Communism for educated Westerners. (Its attraction for militant members of the industrial working class was no real puzzle, she said, not least because Marxism deified the proletariat.) Reviewing the second volume of Solzhenitsyn’s That is not an achievement we associate with her name. Rebecca West is more likely to be recalled for Bolshevism’s appeal to Western intellectuals is a mystery we still struggle to explain. Why did artists who despised patriotism show a larger loyalty to Russian chauvinism? Why did writers defend a regime that repeatedly imprisoned, tortured, and killed writers? In short, why did intelligent people who lived in free countries worship at the altar of despotic states? Few thinkers studied this enigma more carefully than the British critic Rebecca West (1892–1983).5. This may be one of the best-ever NR essays on the intellectual life: Peter Baehr provides a masterful reflection on the late Rebecca West’s writings on Whittaker Chambers, and the essence of what drove the young man to become a Communist. Now, we gather around a screen. The liturgy is still there, but the community and the physical presence are not. Many faith traditions are going online, often forcing un-tech-savvy clerics into un charted waters. Conservative Jews who need a minyan of ten to conduct a prayer service have been improvising over Zoom. This does not work for everyone, however. The Mormon Church has closed all temples, postponing services, such as some weddings and baptisms, that can take place only in a temple ceremony. Orthodox Jews’ strict no-technology rules for Sabbath observance (drawn from the rule against working on the Sabbath) make it impossible to hold services.Most everything about a Catholic Mass is built around the physical gathering of a community. This is not surprising, coming from a tradition that stretches back almost 2,000 years. The churches themselves are laid out for close-quarters seating and processions, not for television broadcasting. The Mass is full of call-and-response prayers and songs. The sign of peace, once conveyed with a kiss, is today typically a handshake. The handshake has been a frequent victim even of regular flu season and may be headed for permanent extinction after the current pandemic. The centerpiece of the Mass is Communion: the believers’ encounter with the physical presence of Christ in the Eucharist. The liturgy surrounding the Eucharist is a commemoration of the Last Supper, itself a communal breaking of bread.Nearly all of those in-person gatherings are suspended right now across all faiths, throughout the country and around much of the world. One of the earliest signs of the gravity and global reach of the pandemic came when the Saudi government announced in early March that it would close Mecca to foreign pilgrims during the annual hajj. In Rome, not far from one of the epicenters of the pandemic, Pope Francis will celebrate Easter from a largely empty St. Peter’s Basilica for a television audience. He will do so without the customary 5 million visitors a year who crowd the Basilica square. Catholic dioceses, ours among them, have issued dispensations from the obligation of Sun day Mass. Less centralized Protestant denominations have made decisions on a church-by-church basis.4. Dan McLaughlin explores the impact on American churchgoers. The mixed evidence led to much tut-tutting from those who already dislike the president, but also genuine concern from those who worry that people will rush out to treat themselves with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine without conclusive evidence from clinical trials. Anthony Fauci, the eminent virologist who has served in six presidential administrations, made the obvious point that while the president was understandably expressing hope that the drug combination might work, we don’t yet have conclusive proof that it does. “I was taking a purely medical, scientific standpoint, and the president was trying to bring hope to the people,” Fauci said on The second category of drug development involves testing treatments for people who already have COVID-19. Some of these drugs treat the symptoms of the COVID-19 disease; others directly attack and kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This latter category includes the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which President Trump has held out as a promising approach. A small French trial of 42 patients with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin showed potential in reducing virus levels in COVID-19 patients. But another trial conducted in China compared the outcome of 15 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine with that of 15 patients who did not; the results showed that the hydroxychloroquine had no apparent effect. A third study, also conducted in China, suggests that a related drug, chloroquine, may clear a patient’s concentration of viral infection, known as the viral load.There are two broad categories of ongoing clinical development related to the pandemic. Vaccines, which help people achieve immunity to the virus, are the farthest off. A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 won’t be ready until late 2021 at the earliest. That’s because vaccines need to be painstakingly tested in clinical trials to ensure that they make patients better, not worse. Flawed vaccines can lead to dangerous overstimulation of the immune system, or can make someone even more sensitive to corona virus exposure. And since you can’t ethically expose someone to coronavirus, you have to give the vaccine to hundreds or even thousands of people and wait to see evidence of whether the vaccine achieves a statistically significant re duction in the number of people who get infected. Furthermore, coronaviruses mutate frequently, meaning that a vaccine developed in one year would likely be less robust, or even completely ineffective, in future years.3. Avik Roy highlights the role pharmaceuticals are playing in combatting the virus. There is also abundant evidence that wages, especially in modern economies, are not flexible downward. Consider two scenarios. In one, the price of everything drops 2 percent and so do everyone’s wages. In the other, the price of everything rises 2 percent and so do wages. In theory, employers and employees ought to be indifferent between these situations: The real wage, the value of a paycheck after adjusting for the price level, stays flat either way. In practice, though, the first scenario of widespread pay cuts doesn’t happen. If the level of spending throughout the economy falls enough that payments to workers must drop too, a lot of those reductions in payments will come from layoffs. That’s what happened during the great recession: The average real wage actually rose.A reduced propensity to spend money on consumption and investment is equivalent to an increased demand for money balances. In a panic, we want to hold on to more of our money. Individual households and businesses can accomplish that goal by spending less. In the aggregate we can’t do it that way: If we all try to spend less we all have less coming in, too. We can, however, attain our goal through a falling price level (or a price level that rises less than it otherwise would); the real value of our money balances thereby increases. Or rather, we could attain it that way if prices were sufficiently flexible. But there are a number of rigidities that prevent this kind of smooth economic adjustment. Mortgage payments, for example, do not drop in response to reductions in spending and prices.Markets cannot see the future, but they are pretty good at processing current information that bears on it. Their implicit projections do not easily fit the hope that a short, sharp recession will be followed by an equally rapid “V-shaped” recovery. They suggest instead that we are at best in for a prolonged period of low growth after the contraction. They further suggest that this low growth will be associated less with continuous supply disruptions than with a persistently depressed willingness to consume and invest: with “demand,” in other words. (Hence the long-lasting decline in expected inflation.)2. Ramesh Ponnuru says that the Fed needs to prepare for the economic recovery. It’s the latest application of the predatory economic and financial strategy that China has long used to gain dominance over almost every industry it has targeted, to coerce developing nations into accepting Chinese loans in exchange for giving mineral rights to China, and to pressure developed countries such as Italy and Greece to turn their historic harbors into ports for China’s global maritime empire. But China’s pharma gambit may be too little, too late. The political tide China is hoping to sidestep by appealing to the financial motives of U.S.-based multinationals is turning against the country now that American consumers, their homes brimming with Chinese-produced electronics, realize the full cost of moving so many critical domestic manufacturing jobs to Communist territory. Americans now understand the urgency of moving production of vital goods back to the United States.China’s game plan is to pit large companies and financial investors against Western populations. Leading Chinese business schools and the creator of China’s top state-owned cement company believe that large U.S. companies and investors can be persuaded to increase foreign investment for the production of pharmaceutical and medical supplies in China. The calculus is that China will be more successful at keeping companies in China by appealing to the financial motives of those that are already invested there than it would be by opposing anti-globalization political constituencies that want companies to move manufacturing out of China.It’s a bold move, but a deeper look reveals the fundamental weakness in China’s dominant position in global logistics and points to two strategic opportunities for the U.S. The first is to bring supply chains for vital medical, pharmaceutical, and technology products and rare-earth minerals back home to the United States. The second is to cripple the Chinese commercial maritime network that has allowed the Chinese Communist Party to sit atop a global supply system like a puppet master pulling the strings of commerce from Wuhan to Westchester.China sees an opportunity to exploit the fear and carnage of the outbreak to strengthen its hold over global supply chains—and the medical-equipment and pharmaceuticals sector is the next industry in China’s sights.While many in the U.S. and the West shelter in place hoping that warmer spring weather will slow the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, China is planning its own Spring Offensive.1.

Our bossman, Rich Lowry, has corralled pieces by 15 exceptional writers to create <strong>The New April 20 Issue of America’s Premier Magazine Is Special Indeed, with 15 Pieces Covering the Coronavirus Scourge</strong>The essential argument of originalism is that the Constitution is a legitimate source of law because it was enacted by the people. It follows from this that changes to the law should be made by the people through the amendment process, rather than by unelected judges’ deciding what the law Harvard Law professor Adrian Vermeule 24. More McLaughlin: He takes on the call for “Common-Good Constitutionalism.” The dwindling number of pro-life Democrats is bad for the pro-life movement, Lipinski says, because it will enable the Republican Party to take the votes of pro-lifers for granted. The near-extinction of pro-life Democrats is bad for his party, he says, because it has cut off a slice of voters.But Lipinski wouldn’t compromise on first principles or sacrifice his conscience to advance a progressive policy agenda. In 2010, he voted for Obamacare when it included an amendment prohibiting tax dollars from subsidizing elective abortion, but he voted against final passage when that amendment was stripped. Cuellar and Peterson voted against the health-care bill both times. Over in the Senate, the remaining self-described pro-life Democrats, Bob Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of West Virginia have mixed records. Although they have voted for late-term abortions bans, they support funding for Planned Parenthood, and Casey voted for Obamacare in 2010.It’s fair to say that Lipinski was the last liberal pro-life Democrat in Congress. Lipinski’s opponents tried to paint him as a conservative, but right-to-life issues are really the only place where he’s broken ranks with the party. In recent years, he earned a 7 percent rating from the National Rifle Association, for instance, and had voted with his party 87 percent of the time, “compared to 92 percent for the average House Democrat,” 23. More McCormack: He praises as a man of conscience the Democrats’ last liberal pro-lifer, Dan Lipinski. UTLA isn’t unique in leveraging the battle to insist upon its prerogatives. Across the state, California Teachers Association locals are stalling efforts to implement distance-learning technology. The governor’s “important emergency declarations have not suspended obligations to negotiate with unions,” United Teachers of Los Angeles president Alex Caputo-Pearl has always hated charter schools — they are typically non-union and (just as typically) outperform union-run schools. But in a letter to the LA school board, governor Gavin Newsom, and state superintendent of public instruction Tony Thurmond, ACP cites the coronavirus as the new reason we can’t afford new charter schools — and especially the space-sharing deals that have allowed charters to move onto campuses with extra capacity in the low-income areas targeted by charters. “Low-income” means “dirty”: His concern, ACP insists, is for hygiene, but even that sounds remarkably like a callback to the water-fountain and bathroom apartheid of the Old South.Consider this morning’s story from That’s how we might read the headlines from California this week. On the one hand, we hear union leaders banging the drum for social solidarity; on the other, we see them using coronavirus-induced panic to advance with utter cynicism the sorts of initiatives that demand they be delivered unto their tormenters (attending Catholic school, as I did, should do the trick).22.

There’s a new British show called Those spring-break clowns down in Florida and the “coronavirus party” doofuses in Kentucky are We the People, too, and if they are not willing to spend a couple of weeks watching Netflix to save grandma’s life — or their own lives — then do you really think they’re going to take an economic bullet over the prospect of losing 3 percent of world economic output a century from now to global-warming -mitigation costs?As I wrote at the beginning of this outbreak, Americans are hard to quarantine. We may yet end up paying a very heavy price for that — in some circumstances, a non-compliance rate of 20 percent (i.e., if every fifth person is a knucklehead) will have effects quite similar to a non-compliance rate of 95 percent. A 51 percent majority works in a city-council election, but an effective social-distancing regimen requires much more.“Oh, but we’ll find them jobs in the new green economy!” comes the response. “It’ll be a net positive!” As though petroleum engineers were lumps of labor that could be reshaped at will by a committee of lawyers in Washington, if only we gave them the power. Nobody is buying that. Not many people are that stupid.Without failing to appreciate the severe immediate economic consequences being felt by Americans in this episode, asking retail and service-industry workers to forfeit their incomes for a few months until their establishments can reopen is a relatively manageable thing even if we are (as I believe we should be) very liberal in doing what we can to protect them financially in the meantime. Telling everybody who works in coal, oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, plastics, and refineries — and a great many people who work in automobiles, aviation, shipping, utilities, construction, agriculture, manufacturing, food processing, utilities, and dozens of other fields — that their companies and their jobs are going away forever is a much larger thing. Telling everybody who does business with those people that they’ll have to consult Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for solvents and industrial polymers — and, you know, lights — would send waves of chaos rippling around the world hard and so fast that you’d need Tom Araya to properly give voice to them.18. Kevin Williamson says adios to the Green New Deal. The third and most pressing question Krugman’s piece raises pertains to “experts.” What specific “expert” advice about the coronavirus are conservatives alleged to have ignored, here? Before the seriousness of the pandemic became apparent and the world shut down, some of the “experts” Krugman’s portrait of conservatives as the cartoon villains in this crisis 17. The crisis has brought out the Paul Krugman in Paul Krugman. John Hirschauer cannot help but observe. Soon after Tom won the argument, he won the fight. Congress banned earmarks, in large part because of the grit and intelligence of one man.Year after year, bill after bill, he showed that earmarks were corrupt and corrupting. They warped Congress and empowered insiders and influence-peddlers at the expense of the public. Projects such as the notorious “Bridge to Nowhere” not only wasted a lot of money; they also covered up even more, because once members got their own personal teaspoon of Swamp water into a bill, party leaders became free to pour in gallons more without losing any votes. Every year, he and his staff put out an exhaustive report on dumb, abusive programs — the annual Waste Book.He didn’t mind. Tom Coburn understood that for outsiders, to win the fight, you first had to win the argument.When Tom first raised red flags about Congress’s addiction to earmarks — special spending provisions inserted into legislation at the explicit direction of individual members — leaders in both parties, to say nothing of the media, laughed at him.Some of his detractors — pork-barrel politicians and their K Street funders, mostly — nicknamed him “Dr. No.” But they misunderstood. Elected officials who take their oaths of office seriously — left, right, and middle — 16. Former senator Jim DeMint remembers his late colleague, Tom Coburn. Whether the subject is slavery or liberty, American history is a story of contested principles. A single birth year cannot unlock the very meaning of the nation, not least because how historians and others explain the past hinges on how they understand the present. An overemphasis on 1619, 1620, or any other year, makes our history far too simple.And yet. The decisions of the American Founding were made by a small subset of the American population, even though the principles they enshrined appealed to many others. Understanding what became the modern United States is utterly impossible without close attention to a host of later developments: the abolition of slavery through the carnage of the Civil War, the New Deal (like it or loathe it), the Civil Rights Movement, and the Immigration Act of 1965.What about the drafting of a new constitution in 1787? The delegates to the Constitutional Convention crafted an enduring framework of government. Although they forged the Constitution through a series of compromises on representation, slavery, and executive power, they enshrined the principles of republican government, checks and balances, and the separation of powers. The first U.S. Congress then passed the amendments that became the Bill of Rights. The decisions of these years shaped the future American political order. The Constitution remains “the supreme law of the land.”So if 1619 and 1620 do not suffice, what about the more obvious 1776 and 1787? 1776 is the nation’s actual “birth year,” but it is far from satisfactory as a starting point for explaining American principles. The only thing that really united the members of the Continental Congress was that they rejected the authority of the British Parliament and monarchy to tax and rule them without their consent. Four score and seven years later, Abraham Lincoln insisted that the nation had been “conceived in liberty” and “dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” It is one of the greatest lines in American history, but it presents an aspirational rather than realistic view of our origins. Author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, made plain, through his actions and his other writings, his belief in African inferiority.15. The From May through October 2019, comprehensive imaging and scientific research and analysis were conducted on the fragments, with National Geographic photographers capturing several phases of the state-of-the-art process. Museum of the Bible wanted to fully document the process, regardless of the results, to facilitate transparent communication with the scholarly community and the general public. From the beginning, plans were in place for a conference to announce the completion of the scientific research effort and to disclose its conclusions.When the Museum of the Bible retained my firm, it gave me the green light to recruit and manage an independent advisory team — of scientists, conservators, and technicians — to design and conduct a rigorous scientific protocol for the imaging and materials analysis of the questioned fragments. Both the museum and the research team agreed that the approach needed to be designed to ensure objectivity, transparency, and reproducibility. That meant that the only role the museum had in our research was to provide access to the collection. It was mutually agreed upon that the museum would not influence the team’s research direction or findings and that our report would be final and released, unedited, to the public.I am the founder and director of Art Fraud Insights, a consultancy dedicated to art-fraud-related lectures and training and to specialized investigation of artworks. I have led an anti-fraud initiative for a major online auction house, trained federal agents in forgery investigations, curated museum exhibitions, and lectured at universities and museums throughout the world. My message has consistently been the same: Fakes and forgeries permeate every sector of the art and culture market. The risk of fraud is substantial, and no collector or institution, no matter how affluent or sophisticated, is immune to it.Starting in 2002, 70 more Dead Sea Scroll fragments appeared on the market. Dead Sea Scrolls experts endorsed them as authentic. Between 2009 and 2014, Steve Green, president of Hobby Lobby and collector of biblical manuscripts and artifacts, purchased a total of 16 fragments with plans to display them in the soon-to-be-built Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. When they were published in 2016, scholars had already started to doubt the fragments’ authenticity. While five of the fragments underwent scientific testing in Germany in 2017, the museum opened with the fragments on display, with signs informing visitors of their uncertain status. In October 2018, the German lab concluded that the five fragments were “inconsistent with ancient origins.” This prompted the museum to investigate its entire collection of 16 fragments more comprehensively, and they sought my help to do so.14. More Museums: This one of The Bible, and its transparent effort to document an investigation into a potential forged artifact. Colette J. Loll oversaw the study, and recounts it. Lighting is low — it’s a drawings show — and spooky, as is much of Beardsley’s art. The wall colors are deep blues, oranges, and greens, deep but not that muted. The colors have a touch of copper and are ever so slightly metallic. The Tate’s shows always look good. This one is gorgeous.The show is chronological and covers all of Beardsley’s book and periodical projects. He was prolific, so covering him takes seven galleries with over a hundred drawings and a space for a film. There are some books and posters in the show as well as the periodicals he illustrated. Beardsley’s drawings weren’t the finished product — the printed sheet was — but it’s a delight to see his foundational work, as faithful as the reproduction process was.Mad, indecent, pungent, dreamy, and more. Aubrey Beardsley (1872–1898) was tubercular from childhood and knew he’d probably die young. As an artist he worked with urgency, and that’s why his drawings look like a linear pressure cooker. He was as focused and fervent as a missionary. His gospel? To make art that created, in his words, “a new world of my own . . . quite mad and a little indecent.”13. Brian Allen checks out the Aubrey Beardsley exhibition at the Tate Museum in London. The work of the young, tubercular Victorian is mad, indecent, and plenty more. This is a huge mistake. Richard Goldberg, of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (a key resource on Iran policy) has argued that we could retain the waiver if the Europeans, Russians, and Chinese promised to “snap back” sanctions in the event that Iran violated the deal. Indeed, under the pact, these countries have pledged to hold Iran accountable. But none of them have any intention of doing so. What they want is to preserve the nuclear deal at all costs; they want to roll back Trump’s sanctions policy, which has made it harder for the Iranians to continue funding terror.But several months later, it appears that Mnuchin is seeking to change the administration’s basic purpose in dealing with Iran. Rather than replacing Obama’s terrible deal, the administration would bow to European and Russian pressure to maintain it in place. Mnuchin is apparently more interested in good relations with the international community than in using American economic power to roll back the alarming gains Iran has made in the Middle East — gains made as a result of Obama’s misguided attempt to bring about a rapprochement with Tehran.In July of last year, the Treasury Department said it required the extensions so it could gauge the impact of the sanctions on the nations that continue to use the waivers to do business with Iran and to work with its nuclear program. At that time, a “senior administration official” Why is Mnuchin pushing for yet another extension of the waivers?Those waivers are among the last vestiges of Obama’s disastrous Iran deal, which enriched and empowered the regime while also allowing it a legal path to a nuclear weapon.12. Hard to believe but Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is keeping alive the Iran Deal. Jonathan Tobin explains. The EU travel restriction was an attempt to hold off the hardening of borders between EU nations themselves. Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland tightened their borders without coordinating with other EU countries. Even Angela Merkel’s Germany, which provided the kindling for populist movements across the continent with its open-borders approach to the 2015 migrant crisis, restricted travel without coordinating with its neighbors.Of course, travel restrictions haven’t prevented the spread of the disease — there’s no such thing as an airtight seal. But restrictions at least bought governments some additional time, and openness to foreign travel from China had been an accelerant on its spread.The lyrics of the treacly John Lennon classic “Imagine” — recently performed by celebrities organized by actress Gal Gadot as a balm in this time of distress — have never been so absurdly inapt. If there were really no countries and the world were as one, we’d be even more vulnerable to whatever threat arises in a city in central China, or anywhere else on the globe.Borders mark off the sovereign territory of one people from another. They are a means — if they can be enforced and defended — for a sovereign state to protect its people from invaders and unwelcome immigrants and goods. They are a tool almost every nation has used to try to keep the coronavirus from gaining a foothold in its population and to try to keep it from spreading further.We are all restrictionists now. In the coronavirus crisis, everyone realizes the importance of borders, even the people who not long ago were ideologically hostile toward them.11. More Lowry: All of a sudden, borders matter. Even to EU dimwits. This is not because government tends to tyranny, though it does if unchecked. It is because people crave security and community. They are willing to sacrifice their individual liberties, at least to a degree and for a time, to preserve them. This does not make them craven. It makes them rational.It is all well and good for libertarians to say that the Constitution is not suspended in emergencies, and that are our rights are never more essential than when government’s tyrannical tendencies rear their head. But then real emergencies happen. Inevitably, unavoidably, our rights get restricted — sometimes dramatically.Times of true security crises — war, natural catastrophes, or the sudden spread of a potentially deadly disease — have a remorseless way of reminding us about some brute realities.Alas, when it gets down to brass tacks, even those two beacons, liberty and law, are as much in tension as in mutual need. It is by law that society restricts our freedom. On the other hand, as Burke observed, without the order that a just legal system ensures, there can be no liberty worth having. We would descend into anarchy, into the law of the jungle.Pandemic in the land is putting strain on our self-image as a free people for whom the rule of law is our 10. How goes the Constitution in times of true duress? Andy McCarthy explains. In short, the epidemic has put in stark relief the pettiness and absurdity of much that has taken place in our national life since Trump won the presidency. This crisis is the unmistakable punctuation mark on that post-2016 era and the beginning of something new.After acting as though we had endless time and energy to waste on nonsense because the stakes were so small in what was, until the day before yesterday, a time of peace and prosperity, we have been jolted into a period when our national decisions really matter, and time and resources are of the essence.After we spent months pretending that Trump would somehow be ousted from the presidency by his own party in the Senate, not only is he still the president, all people of good will are rooting for him to perform as ably as he can in this crisis.After all the energy devoted to inflating the Russians into a clear-and-present danger to the workings of America here on our shores, that threat has instead proved to be China, which loosed a virus on the world that has temporarily crashed the American economy and shut down much of American life, including elections.9. The impeachment idiocy, and much more courtesy of the bogus crisis manufacturers, was the fiddling, says Rich Lowry, while the fires burned in Wuhan. Travel forecasts from China for 2020, even amid the trade war, had estimated more than 8,000 daily arrivals in California. Two years ago, Los Angeles mayor Garcetti bragged that 1.1 million Chinese tourists had visited L.A. — more than 3,000 per day. The greatest number of foreign tourists to Los Angeles are Chinese, and the city is the favorite spot in America of all visitors from China. During the months of October, November, January, and February alone — before the travel ban — perhaps nearly 1 million Chinese citizens arrived in California on direct and indirect flights originating in China.Forty-million-person California, in normal times — that is, until around or shortly after February 1, 2020 — hosts dozens of daily direct flights from China in general to San Diego, SFO, LAX, and San Jose, and in particular, since 2014, several weekly nonstop flights from Wuhan. Of the nearly 15,000 passengers who were estimated to be arriving every day in the U.S. on flights from China in 2019 and 2020, the majority flew into California. After the ban, there were thousands of Chinese tourists who remained in California and could get neither direct nor indirect flights home to China.Even at this midpoint in the virus’s ascendance, most believed that California would be faring far worse. And they have good reason for such pessimism. California in a normal year usually experiences the greatest number of deaths associated with the flu in the United States, and it ranks about midway among the states in flu deaths per capita. The state was hit hard by influenza unusually early in the first weeks of November, including a strain that at the time was characterized as probably not “A” but a rarer “B” — and on occasion quite virulent. A typical news story related, in early 2020, “California health officials have identified 16 outbreaks since the start of the flu season Sept. 29. Flu cases, hospitalizations and flu deaths are all higher than anticipated, according to the health department.” Many Californians complained late in 2019 of getting the flu a bit early, with flu symptoms that were somewhat different from the norm, at times including severe muscle aches, some digestive cramping, an unproductive cough, and days or even weeks of post-fever fatigue.8. California was supposed to be the epicenter, wasn’t it? Victor Davis Hanson asks some questions about the known unknowns in the Golden State. It’s even worse than it looks, because Horowitz didn’t scrutinize the raw-evidence case files, which, for all we know, is teeming with mitigating evidence and facts omitted from the applications. If agents were this “sloppy” with warrants, what makes anyone believe that they collected the foundational evidence in a more professional manner?If you’re keeping score at home, only three of 75 FISA applications (4 percent) used to spy in the investigation, starting in October 2014, were Put it this way, the new IG report found a total of A 7. More Harsanyi: The title says it all: “The FISA Scandal Is about Corruption, Not ‘Sloppiness.’” The facts back up Bolton and Morrison. During the summer of 2018, Bolton reorganized the Trump NSC. In January 2017, there were directorates for nonproliferation and arms control, for weapons of mass destruction and terrorism, and for global health security and biodefense. Bolton merged the three directorates into a “counterproliferation and biodefense” directorate. According to administration officials I spoke with, this reorganization was designed in part to have better cooperation between those monitoring and preparing for intentional biological threats on one hand and for naturally occurring biological threats on the other. This directorate is now headed by Anthony Ruggiero.Former Trump officials, including That’s why this charge from former Obama-administration officials — including As for the matter of containing and mitigating the disease, Americans should have an idea about whether they can have confidence in their government. Dealing with a potentially devastating new disease to which the population has no immunity and of which there are no known vaccines is frightening enough without worrying about the government’s competence.6. Rebeccah Heinrichs reviews the White House Pandemic Team and finds any judgment about its actions useless until we are through this madness. Lindell is a villain for speaking his truth, as the kids say. Yet the Of course, anyone who shows anything less than hostility toward the president is immediately cast as a reactionary, and their actions dismissed as questionable and self-serving. Many of the CEOs who have stood with Trump at his press conferences — this week, or in weeks prior — hold varying religious and partisan beliefs. The press didn’t have similar qualms about the CEOs of CVS or Walgreens, because they kept their views to themselves.NBC? Not so much. The headline on its “analysis” of Lindell’s remarks was “Trump fluffs MyPillow in Rose Garden.” This matched the basic tone taken by a large faction within the political press. Why? Presumably because, at the end of his remarks, Lindell claimed that the Lord Almighty had helped elect Donald Trump president to save our once-beleaguered nation from its alleged depravations. Listen, if there is a God, I hope He refrains from tipping the scales of presidential contests. But it’s not surprising to hear an evangelical Christian talking about the world this way — unless, that is, you’ve never met one.MyPillow CEO Michael Lindell, a self-made former crack addict, is going to transform 75 percent of his manufacturing capacity to make 10,000 cotton face masks per day by the end of the week, ramping up production to 50,000 a day in a month. That sounds like a patriotic act to me, especially given that Lindell is undertaking the effort without being forced to do so by a federal agency. I hope the guy becomes a billionaire after this is all over.5. David Harsanyi blasts those who have made grandstanding journalist Yamiche Alcindor a hero at the expense of MyPillow CEO Michael Lindell. I will also work with my colleagues in Congress to review U.S. contributions to the WHO. Most of our contributions can be used at the discretion of the WHO leadership. Maintaining current levels of U.S. contributions should depend on whether the WHO can reclaim its independence. First, we need investigations into the WHO’s unacceptably slow decision-making on whether to declare a global pandemic and into how China has compromised the integrity of the WHO. As well, we need accompanying reforms.The world’s leading global health organization cannot be used as a tool of the CCP, and the U.S. — the WHO’s largest financial contributor, giving Examples that could prove fatal are rife. In December, the WHO 4. Marco Rubio jumps on the World Health Organization, the toady of Red China, consumed by politics. RELATED: This is the kind of liberal dip-dung being published about Cotton back in January. Of course, while the travel restriction may have bought the United States time, that time was largely squandered by the “I commend the president greatly for ultimately making the right decision contrary to what the so-called experts were telling him,” he says.On January 31, the president announced a ban on entry to foreign travelers who had been in China in the previous two weeks, while allowing Americans and permanent residents to continue to travel back and forth between the two countries. The measure was not as stringent as Cotton’s call for a ban on all commercial flights, but Cotton points out that the president “did not have many advisers encouraging him to shut down travel.” Advisers who were supportive tended to be national-security aides, he adds, while “most of his economic and public-health advisers were ambivalent at best about the travel ban.”“Two things struck me about China’s response,” he says. “First their deceit and their dishonesty going back to early December. And second, the extreme draconian measures they had taken. By the third week of January, they had more than 75 million people on lockdown. They were confined to their homes and apartments, otherwise they were arrested. In some cases, the front doors of those buildings were welded shut. All schools had shut down. Hong Kong had banned flights from the mainland. [These are] the kind of extreme, draconian measures that you would only take in a position of power in China if you were greatly worried about the spread of this virus.”In an interview with National Review, Cotton is quick to point out that he doesn’t have a background in science or public health, but he does have two eyes. As a long-time China hawk, he found his interest piqued early on by reports “primarily from East Asian news sources.”What tipped the senator off to the true nature of the threat? Why was he the first and the loudest voice in Congress to sound the alarm about the looming pandemic?3. Senator Tom Cotton was the man who saw this chaos coming and sounded the alarms. John McCormack recounts. Finally, in a more extreme scenario, important countries could experience the kind of economic shock that leads to widespread social and political collapse. At that point, China would have a unique opportunity to step in, provide aid, and refashion these countries in its image. It would look like a repeat of the Marshall Plan and the beginning of the American world order after the ravages of World War II. Indonesia, South Asia, and even Russia might be of special interest in such a scenario.The second lever resides with industrial value chains. Last month General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler closed all their automotive production plants across the United States and Canada. Other sectors have followed. In the meantime, China contained the worst of the pandemic to one province, allowing economic activity to quickly resume elsewhere. The most recent data show renewed activity in the flow of goods across the country, as well as at ports worldwide that do business with China. If the freeze in Europe and America continues for much longer, Chinese companies will be able to dramatically expand market share and replace Western-led value chains. Just yesterday Chinese authorities announced that manufacturing activity expanded in March, defying expectations of a contraction. In February the official Purchasing Managers’ Index hit a record low of 35.7. It bounced back to 52.0 in March. Prepare for a worldwide wave of Chinese acquisitions at knockdown prices.The first one is the direct comparison between the situation in China and elsewhere. The numbers of cases and fatalities provided by Chinese authorities almost certainly misrepresent the real figures by more than an order of magnitude, but the fact remains that a semblance of normalcy was achieved in a small period of time. If the United States fails to do the same, its prestige will suffer a severe blow. People all over the world will quickly change their perceptions about relative power and capacity.Forget about “mask diplomacy.” It is no more than a distraction. There are other ways for China to use the coronavirus pandemic to upturn the existing global order. I see three main levers.2. Bruno Maçães seconds the motion that brutal Peking Marxists have far-reaching plans in exploiting the locally sourced coronavirus. As the death toll in Italy soared, China flew in a team of medical experts and nearly 30 tons of medical equipment. On a phone call a week later with Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte, Chinese president Xi Jinping pledged additional supplies and medical personnel. China also shipped medical equipment to Spain, Austria, and the Czech Republic, and millions of protective masks to France, the Netherlands, Greece, and other nations. But the aid was too late. By late March the death toll in Italy had surpassed the total that China was officially reporting, and even the news that the number of cases had dropped for the first time was accompanied by photos of Italian-army trucks carrying the dead on their final journey.It’s too early to say that the coronavirus crisis spells the end of globalization, but as the pandemic unfolds, the outlines of a new international trade and political order are emerging in the Mediterranean region. Call it “globalization with Chinese characteristics.”By quietly acquiring a global network of commercial ports from countries and investors unable or unwilling to maintain their critical economic infrastructure, China has reverse-engineered the logic of conquest: Chinese state-owned companies now control a base network of the sort that previous global hegemons obtained through military victory. Expect China to use the coronavirus crisis to accelerate its efforts to use that economic leverage to pull host countries deeper into Beijing’s political orbit.1. Your Humble Correspondent believes that this is one of the most important pieces NRO has published of late — Christopher O’Dea’s rundown of China’s plans for global hegemony. <strong>A Quartet of Sextets of Profound Writings of Conservative Wisdom and Monumental Reporting and Analysis, All of Which Will Stoke Your Intellectual Fires</strong>There is a flash sale of NRPLUS (flash in the PG sense). The Suits (encouraged by The Blazers) have decreed there will be a 50%-off offer that will run through this evening (Saturday, April 4). If you have <strong>What a Deal: Consider It Half Free!</strong>All the Democrats have to do is bring the voters on board and convince them that a version of the economic hardships Americans are suffering during the coronavirus shutdown are worth continuing to endure for the sake of global warming—which is what a net-zero rule imposed on the U.S. economy would effectively demand.If the Democrats want to pass a law subordinating the economic interests of the United States to fashionable global-warming hysteria, then let them do it. We are confident that Nancy Pelosi would be happy to oblige, and Joe Biden has promised to out-crackpot the crackpots on the issue, imposing a net-zero standard on the United States as a whole by 2050.The critics of the new fuel-economy rules should give up on pretending that this is about fuel economy, about saving Americans money when they fill up their vehicles. This is about the global-warming crusade. Transportation is a major source of greenhouse-gas emissions in the United States, and tailpipe emissions are a big part of that. Congress has been given several opportunities to enact a sweeping climate-change agenda, and Congress repeatedly has declined to act. The pollution rules in the Clean Air Act were intended to address local air-quality issues (think of Los Angeles’s smog problem, once much worse than it is today) and domestic externalities — not to recruit the United States into a global climate-change crusade. President Barack Obama infamously vowed to act unilaterally when Congress declined to go along with his agenda: “I’ve got a pen, and I’ve got a phone!” he thundered. President Trump has a pen, too. Using the regulatory process as a pretext to yoke the United States to climate-change radicalism was cheap and undemocratic — and it is, as it turns out, impermanent.1.

Within the past several years, “sickness masks” have morphed into a trendsetting What are the lessons? The 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic took the lives of nearly 500,000 Japanese. (For perspective, the combined death toll after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was 200,000.)

But Japan, despite sharing a maritime border with China and nearly one million tourists in January 2020, has so far managed to spare its 127 million citizens the medical and financial disaster of COVID-19. With about ten geographically isolated “hotspots” across Japan, there have been fewer COVID-19 deaths in that nation in a three-month period than among the 400,000 people of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the past six weeks.

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.Common sense tells us that aid to a foe should come only after victory over that foe. There should be no Marshall Plan for Iran as long as the present regime continues on its belligerent track. Similarly, we should not be aiding Palestinian leaders who, to varying degrees, act against U.S. interests. The generosity of the American people requires that our enemies cease to behave as such. This is our quid pro quo.The U.S. is coping with nationwide shortages of ventilators, personal protective equipment, and coronavirus tests. Any supplies we can spare should be sent to allies, not to enemies. And as the effects of an economic shutdown grow ever more grave, on top of our $22 trillion debt, we should not be sending cash to regimes that have shown no regard for the suffering of their own people.Even as the U.S. maintains sanctions on the Iranian regime, our European allies are finding ways to fund it. The Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), a system devised by European nations to sidestep sanctions and continue trade with Iran, is already up and running.We cannot trust the Iranian regime to use millions of dollars in humanitarian aid from the West on the public-health crisis at hand. We know that the Iranian regime seeks to continue to build its nuclear program; that it has launched missiles at American forces in the region; and that it oppresses the Iranian people, suppressing all dissent within the country, in order to stay in power. Judging from history and recent events, we can also assume that Iran’s leaders would siphon off some of the money to pad their personal fortunes. But the U.S. already did offer medical aid to Iran, and that offer was rebuffed. And we have recent indications of how the mullahs use cash transfers. Of the massive windfall Iran received from President Obama’s ill-conceived JCPOA, much went to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, while billions went straight into Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s private bank account, according to former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The Such demands ignore the fact that Iran (following China’s lead) is engaged in a disinformation campaign that seeks to convince the world that the coronavirus originated in the U.S. as a biological weapon. An Iranian “researcher,” Amir Mousavi, appeared on RT, the Russian government–run TV network, wearing a face mask, accusing the U.S. of having “waged biological wars before.” He told his Russian interviewer that “scientists in Iranian labs — with the help of Russia, China, and Cuba — are laboring to study the possibility” that the U.S. created the coronavirus. He added that Chinese leader Xi Jinping went beyond considering it a “possibility” and “officially accused the United States.” Similarly, he said, “research centers in Russia — and even some American institutions — have begun to raise doubts on whether this virus is natural or made in a lab.”Iran has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. Some of our allies (especially Germany, France, and the U.K.) are requesting that the U.S. dial back its “maximum pressure” campaign on the Iranian regime by easing economic sanctions. Many pundits in the U.S. are demanding the same.
While Israeli missile companies like Israel has already provided aid to the Palestinians to combat the coronavirus. It delivered 20 tons of disinfectant to the West Bank, as well as test kits and training for Palestinian health-care workers. It sent 200 test kits to Gaza and offered more direct aid to Hamas on the condition that Hamas return the remains of two Israeli soldiers killed in the 2014 Gaza war. Instead, Hamas launched rockets into Israel. Israel’s good-will efforts have not been reciprocated. There is little reason to think that U.S. humanitarian aid would be used for the stated purpose.But providing aid to the Palestinians means handing $75 million to the PA and Hamas. What do the senators think Palestinian leaders will do with that money? Judging from a long historical record, they are likely to use it to continue their fight against Israel — launching rockets and digging tunnels to smuggle weaponry and murderers into Israel, paying stipends to the families of terrorists caught or killed in the act — and to line their own pockets.In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, Patrick Leahy, Bernie Sanders, Tom Udall, Jeff Merkley, Tom Carper, and Sherrod Brown are demanding that the U.S. provide $75 million in humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza. In a March 26 letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the senators, all Democrats, gave him until April 3 to specify how the State Department will ensure that the money “mandated by the FY 2020 Appropriations Act” will be used to “provide the Palestinian people with access to adequate medicine, medical equipment, personnel, and other resources to combat the threat of a major coronavirus health crisis” in the West Bank and Gaza.Eight U.S. senators are proposing a massive aid package for Palestinians in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and the Fatah-controlled (and PLO-dominated) Palestinian Authority (the so-called West Bank), and many pundits are urging the Trump administration to end sanctions against Iran. Both of these proposals would, in effect, aid and empower our enemies, and therefore undermine rather than serve U.S. interests at a critical moment.<span class=""drop"">I</span>

					© 2020 National Review				Our Capital Letter email newsletter delivers a weekly digest on finance, business, and economics from an NR sensibility. As of Monday morning, more than 9,600 Americans had died of coronavirus. In New York, the number of new deaths fell for the first time this weekend, which supports the argument that the state is close to the peak.As many U.S. states approach the peak of this initial wave of coronavirus infections, the growth of new cases is slowing in most of the hardest-hit states.

But if someone who worked at either of the two laboratories in the city researching coronaviruses in bats had been accidentally infected, and then that person traveled through the city, unwittingly infecting others, and The scenario where a horseshoe bat carrying COVID-19 naturally flew into the city is an extremely unlikely scenario. It is possible that someone trapped a bat 850 miles away from the city and brought it to the market to be sold for consumption. But that explanation doesn’t quite fit with the early patients who couldn’t be traced back to the market, and the genome mapping suggesting that the strain discovered at the one patient who they knew had been to the market wasn’t the original strain.Yunnan province is about 850 miles from Wuhan, China. We do know for certain that Could a vendor at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan or elsewhere in the city have sold bats or pangolins for human consumption? Sure. But as of now, we don’t H3 mutated to the H1 by two substitutions, and none of the Market samples encoded H3 in the currently available samples, suggesting that H3 might have originated and spread outside of the Market before an early stage of population expansion. The non-synonymous mutation from H3 to H1 might have enhanced the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2, and a functional characterization should be performed to confirm this speculation. That study, How this virus moved from animal to human populations is yet to be determined. The outbreak clearly began epidemiologically at the Wuhan market, and a number of environmental samples from around the live animal section of the market were subsequently found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2Those Australian microbiologists want a ban on wet markets and more enforcement of the ban on the trade of exotic species. But they also make an important point that we do not know, with absolute certainty, that the first cases were a result of someone eating bats or pangolins:Evidence from the sequence analyses clearly indicates that the reservoir host of the virus was a bat, probably a Chinese or Intermediate horseshoe bat, and it is probable that, like SARS-CoV, an intermediate host was the source of the outbreak. To ensure that future cross-species transmission events of this new virus don’t occur again in the future, it is important to identify the reservoir and intermediate wildlife hosts. The closest known wildlife sequence to SARS-CoV-2 remains the sequence from the virus isolated from an Intermediate horseshoe bat, but there were significant differences in the receptor-binding domain between the two viruses. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086482/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">This recent assessment from two microbiologists in Australia,</a><strong>Crucially, the scientists were also able to isolate and culture a live virus that binds to a receptor on a human cell. That suggests that direct bat-to-human infection would likely occur.</strong>Dr. Daszak and his colleagues chose to study a horseshoe bat colony in Yunnan province in southwest China—hundreds of miles from the big wildlife-for-food markets of Guangdong province, where SARS was first reported. The researchers took hundreds of samples from the horseshoe bats. A genetic analysis revealed at least seven different strains of SARS-like coronaviruses circulating in that single group of animals.But a key puzzle remained. <strong>SARS is caused by a germ known as a coronavirus.</strong>The new bat-to-human discovery suggests that the control tactic may have limited effectiveness because a SARS-like virus remains loose in the wild and could potentially spark another outbreak.While bats have previously been fingered as a host for SARS, it was believed that the virus jumped from there to weasel-like mammals known as civets, where it went through genetic changes before infecting people. Operating on that belief, The findings create new fears about the emergence of diseases like SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The virus spread quickly from person to person in 2003 and had a mortality rate of at least 9%. Worries of a severe pandemic led the World Health Organization to issue an emergency travel advisory.A decade after SARS swept through the world and killed more than 750 people, scientists have made a troubling discovery: Keep in mind, there may not have been an intermediary species. One of the few fleeting references to a Chinese wet market selling bats came back in 2013 in the Then again, vendors trading in those animals probably did their best to keep their merchandise secret. Back in 2013, the There are a (InterestinglyBut for what it’s worth, those articles don’t describe or mention vendors selling bats or pangolins, the anteater-like other animal species that is suspected to be a possible “transfer species” — i.e, the bat gives COVID-19 to the pangolin, some human being either eats or otherwise comes in contact with the pangolin, and contracts the virus. This doesn’t mean that those markets Those articles describe vendors selling dog meat, cats, pigs, sheep, cows, turtles, frogs, snakes, rats, foxes, and minxes.You can find a lot of coverage of wet markets and quite a few references to the potential threat of a viral outbreak before this year — in But that From that point until I started doing the research for Friday’s article, “. . . Despite such shortcomings, Western experts say Chinese officials have come a long way since their wobbly handling of the 2002 outbreak of SARS, the severe respiratory disease caused by a previously unknown coronavirus; Chinese apparatchiks initially tried to cover up the epidemic, creating a worldwide scandal.. . . China is uniquely positioned to create a novel flu virus that kills people. On Chinese farms, people, poultry and other livestock often live in close proximity. Pigs can be infected by both bird flu and human flu viruses, becoming potent “mixing vessels” that allow genetic material from each to combine and possibly form new and deadly strains. The public’s taste for freshly killed meat, and the conditions at live markets, create ample opportunity for humans to come in contact with these new mutations.At least two flu pandemics in the past century—in 1957 and 1968—originated in the Middle Kingdom and were triggered by avian viruses that evolved to become easily transmissible between humans. Although health authorities have increasingly tried to ban the practice, millions of live birds are still kept, sold and slaughtered in crowded markets each year. In a study published in January, researchers in China concluded that these markets were a “main source of H7N9 transmission by way of human-poultry contact and avian-related environmental exposures.”Early on in this crisis, I read a November 2017 <strong>What We Know and What We Don’t Know about the Source of COVID-19</strong>Just one big story today: collecting and sorting through what we know about the coronavirus’s origins, and what makes sense and what doesn’t in the theory that it originated from someone eating bats or pangolins from the Huanan Seafood Market.National ReviewFollow Us",0,All Signs Point to China

Heller Professor of Law at the University of California at Berkeley, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, </em>Seizing Chinese property would allow the United States to finally use international law to its advantage. Let China try to go to court and claim that the U.S., its allies, and the developing world have violated international rules. Let Beijing try to show that these nations have no right to compensation for its coverup of the coronavirus outbreak. Let the Chinese Communist Party try to claim, outside its own borders, just as it does within them, that it can deny common sense and blame the very victims of its wrongdoing for the worst public-health catastrophe in a century.In addition to halting any further trade cooperation with Beijing, the administration could also seize the assets of Chinese state-owned companies. Under its Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing reportedly has loaned billions to developing nations in Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, and then taken over their strategic ports and facilities once the debts fall due. The U.S. could turn this strategy on its head by supporting the expropriation of these assets by legal process and the cancellation of these debts as compensation for coronavirus losses.According to China experts, President Xi Jinping depends on a humming economy and appeals to nationalism for his political legitimacy. The U.S. and its allies could strike at the heart of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) claim to a mandate from heaven by further ratcheting up the pressure on Beijing to adopt a more cooperative, transparent stance on public health by imposing economic sanctions and inflicting serious economic harm on China. The Trump administration could enhance its efforts to exclude China from buying and selling The U.S. should also punish China for its coronavirus failings as an incentive for Beijing to mend its ways. Washington could persuade leading nations to join it in excluding Chinese scholars and students from scientific research centers and universities. China has used its Thousand Talents program to recruit scientists to help steal sensitive technology from American laboratories. Confucius Institutes have spread propaganda while masquerading as Chinese cultural centers. Senator Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Representative Francis Rooney (R., Fla.) have introduced the Stop Higher Education Espionage and Theft Act to help colleges protect against threats by foreign actors.Rather than rely on corrupt, conflicted international institutions such as the WHO, the United States and its allies should engage in self-help. To protect against the next virus outbreak, the U.S. should create a new monitoring mechanism that can detect global health threats early, spread information about them reliably, and coordinate national efforts to develop a response. The International Atomic Energy Agency’s inspection regime for illicit nuclear weapons could provide a model. The U.S. and other wealthy nations could establish a similar inspection regime and provide financial assistance to developing nations that agree to participate. “Trust but verify” could become the watchword not just for Ronald Reagan’s nuclear-reduction treaties with the Soviets, but for a truly effective global health system.
In fact, China has used its financial war chest to manipulate the WHO. China’s annual funding of the organization, which relies on voluntary donations, has increased to $86 million since 2014 (a rise of 52 percent). The WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has praised China’s leadership for its “openness to share information” with the international community and stated that China “has bought the world time” regarding the coronavirus. In January, the WHO parroted China’s line that there was no “clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus.” The WHO has also followed the Chinese line on Taiwan, excluding it from membership and barring it from COVID-19 response meetings. While some scholars have suggested that a larger budget would make the WHO more effective, the Trump administration has rightly halved America’s contribution. Not only has the WHO become a Chinese client, but it also spends The World Health Organization (WHO) has only a weak, non-binding dispute-resolution mechanism, but China’s failure to promptly report the coronavirus outbreak to the organization violated the International Health Regulations, which require states to notify the WHO of potential public-health emergencies “of international concern.”The U.S. and its allies also could try to sue China before an international tribunal, such as the International Court of Justice, although countries have never been sued for their violation of International institutions provide no meaningful way to force China to remedy the harm it has caused. The United Nations Security Council, allegedly the supreme lawmaking and executive body in international law, cannot hold China to account because China and Russia exercise their permanent right to veto any Security Council resolution. China has rendered the U.N. impotent, even though U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has declared the COVID-19 pandemic the world’s most challenging crisis since World War II, as it has become a threat to international peace and security by shutting down swaths of the global economy and killing thousands, if not millions.If China were an individual, a company, or a law-abiding nation, it would be required to provide compensation for the harm it has inflicted globally. The United States alone may well suffer 200,000 or more deaths, billions in health-care costs, trillions in lost economic activity, and trillions more in new government spending. China’s failures render it legally liable under international law, but the COVID-19 crisis has exposed the crisis of ineffectiveness and corruption of international institutions. Instead of focusing on international law, the U.S. should thus protect its national interests by opting for the self-help mechanism.<span class=""drop"">O</span>

In fact, you might have figured the regime would have already held a show trial and/or execution by now. The regime says the origin of this virus is still a mystery . . . and authoritarian regimes that like their populaces to see them as all-knowing and all-powerful are not usually big fans of unsolved mysteries. What’s going on with this?There are two other dogs that aren’t barking, so to speak. First, the Chinese government has reopened the wet markets. (As noted earlier, from the first cases of COVID-19, Some might ask why we should bother looking into this if clear answers are likely to never be found; the Chinese government certainly isn’t going to welcome outside investigators to go poking around the city of Wuhan and its own labs, trying to determine the source of the virus. But the origin of the coronavirus is the biggest and most consequential mystery in the world right now. Until we know how this virus got into humans, we live with the risk of it happening again with another strain — perhaps an even more virulent or contagious one.Dr. Simon Anthony, a professor at the public health grad school of Columbia University, told CNN, “Early in the outbreak … everyone was talking about the thing having emerged from the wet market. And now I think the data calls into question whether or not that’s really true.”“I think people went into the fish market who were already infected,” Vincent Racaniello, a microbiology professor at Columbia University, told CNN. “In bats, these viruses are intestinal viruses, and they are shedding the bat feces, which we call guano,” he said. “And if you go into a bat cave, it is littered with guano. And farmers in many countries harvest the guano to fertilize their fields.”Rutgers University bioweapons expert Dr. Richard Ebright told CNN, “the possibility that the virus entered humans through a laboratory accident cannot and should not be dismissed… It is absolutely clear the market had no connection with the origin of the outbreak virus, and, instead, only was involved in amplification of an outbreak that had started elsewhere in Wuhan almost a full month earlier.”CNN recently spoke to some of the country’s top virologists and For what it’s worth, the “accidental release from a lab” scenario is apparently being contemplated by (If you’ve ever thought your job was difficult, just think of the words “low-safety diarrhea research lab.”)Some scientists hailed the report and Li’s resignation. “This is a clear sign to Chinese scientists and the rest of the world that the Chinese government is taking [biosafety] seriously,” says Guan Yi, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong. But others are disappointed that many details about the incident and the lab’s operating procedures remain hidden. “I was hoping for a full, more open account of what happened,” says Tony Della-Porta, an Australian biosafety consultant who helped investigate earlier SARS escapes in Singapore and Taiwan.The outbreak earlier this year, which sickened eight people in Beijing and Anhui Province and killed one (SARS has sent the head of another top official in China rolling. Yesterday, director Li Liming of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) resigned, along with several lower-ranking officials, after a report by a panel of experts blamed China’s most recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome on a series of flaws at the CDC’s National Institute of Virology in southern Beijing.I feel like the “laboratory accident” scenario is being dismissed out of hand by some people who do not realize that Did someone encounter or eat a pangolin elsewhere in Wuhan away from the Huanan Seafood Market, contract SARS-CoV-2, travel around the city infecting others, By applying the reported bat coronavirus genome (bat-RaTG13-CoV) as the outgroup, we found that haplotypes H13 and H38 might be considered as ancestral haplotypes, and later H1 (whose descendants included all samples from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market) was derived from the intermediate haplotype H3. The population size of the SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have undergone a recent expansion on 06 January 2020, and an early expansion on 08 December 2019. Phyloepidemiologic analyses suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 source at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was potentially imported from elsewhere. The crowded market then boosted SARS-CoV-2 circulation and spread it to the whole city in early December 2019.But probably the most glaring not-fitting puzzle piece is the The closest known wildlife sequence to SARS-CoV-2 remains the sequence from the virus isolated from an Intermediate horseshoe bat, but there were significant differences in the receptor-binding domain between the two viruses. Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) have been suggested as potential intermediate hosts, and SARS-like viruses have been identified in pangolins seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China, but they only shared about 85–92% homology with SARS-CoV-2.As noted yesterday, First, as that But this piece of the puzzle is a challenging fit with other research that was pointing away from the origin of COVID-19 being the Huanan Seafood Market.If the genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus point to this virus percolating in pangolins for a while before jumping to humans, they point to a pangolin, and make the lab accident or improperly disposed viral material scenarios less likely. There certainly is enough evidence to suggest that illegal While it is possible that one of the two major laboratories in Wuhan, China, researching coronaviruses also had pangolins in their labs, at this point we have no evidence indicating that those labs used those animals. (The authors of this study are cautious; they note that we don’t know what we don’t know: “Although no animal coronavirus has been identified that is sufficiently similar to have served as the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV-2, the diversity of coronaviruses in bats and other species is massively undersampled.” It’s conceivable that somewhere out there is a bat with a strain of the coronavirus that is nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2 found in humans, but that bat hasn’t been found yet.In theory, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 acquired RBD mutations (Fig. Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models has been ongoing for many years in biosafety level 2 laboratories across the worldYesterday someone sent me <strong>Does COVID-19 All Trace Back to Pangolins?</strong>On the menu today: One scientific research paper makes the case that SARS-CoV-2 — the type of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — must have spent time percolating in a pangolin, the anteater-like species that is one of the world’s most heavily trafficked animals.

The question is how much this sort of mask-wearing, hands-washing, spaced-out economic activity would increase the risk of further infections. At some point, the economic consequences will get so severe that the risk will become acceptable.You could probably reopen most of America’s retail stores under this scenario. Already grocery stores and pharmacies are operating, encouraging social distancing and limiting capacity in some cases. Could most other stores work that way?

No charge.Somebody needs to be blamed for the situation in which the most powerful nation in the world currently finds itself, and it is not going to be Donald Trump’s government if he and his sycophants, of whom Senator Graham is the slavering chief, have anything to say about it. Disgust is a powerful feeling, one with enough force to overwhelm rational thought. That is of some interest to Trump et al. just now. But there isn’t any juice in giving the hairy eyeball to poultry farms belonging to friends of Senator Graham or red-state pork operations. So let it be the “gross” and “disgusting” Chinese, and give the “Mexican rapists” the day off.It is comforting to tell ourselves that this sort of thing is alien to the American experience — so alien, in fact, that no one could reasonably expect the gentlemen in Washington who comport themselves as potentates to make reasonable preparations against it. Nobody could have seen this coming — except Bill Gates, George W. Bush, Alex Azar . . .Chinese wet markets are the sort of thing we do not really have in the United States, though they hardly are limited to China, either: Similar meat markets can be found throughout much of the world. The only Chinese city I have visited is Hong Kong, which may as well be Zurich as far as public hygiene goes. The situation apparently is different in the Chinese hinterland. Traveling elsewhere in Asia and Latin America — and Philadelphia too — I have smelled some smells that I would not care to experience again. But the point of the ritual denunciation of the Chinese wet market — like the insistence upon calling this the “Chinese virus” or the “foreign virus,” as though viruses carried passports — is emotional insulation.In fact, the denunciations of the Chinese wet markets have little or nothing to do with reducing the threat of future epidemics. The disgust may be genuine, but the rhetoric surrounding it is The Interstate Commerce Clause is ready when you are, Senator Graham.But if that is to be our standard, then Senator Graham should give some thought to the fact that his state’s two biggest farm commodities are chickens and turkeys, which are produced in intensive factory-style operations. Disgusting? Ask the locals: 
The remarkably elastic senator from South Carolina has threatened to restrict U.S.–China trade unless Beijing agrees to shut down the so-called wet markets at which live animals, including wild ones, are sold for human consumption. These markets are “gross” and “disgusting,” the senator says. And indeed they are.Lindsay Graham is.There are a few conservatives who agree with the Case case, and Case is a critic of U.S.-style “factory farming” who wishes to see it heavily regulated — Senator Cory Booker has introduced legislation to do that — and then outlawed altogether. “Factory farms are an abomination,” he writes, “cruel to animals and a bad deal for humans, too. The sooner we abolish them, the better.” I disagree with his conclusions, but he is scrupulous about the facts of the case, and he correctly notes that the H1N1 “swine flu” epidemic (a “pandemic” by WHO’s reckoning) is suspected to have its origin in North American pork operations. (It gets complicated; viruses travel.) The Spanish flu epidemic that killed millions of people from 1918–1920 is thought to have originated on a pig farm, too. <span class=""drop"">A</span>

Also, people with preexisting medical conditions might be less likely to seek inpatient care given the rash of COVID cases in city hospitals, which could explain part of the rise in domestic mortality. In any case, it’s possible — likely, in fact — that the city and the state of New York are undercounting coronavirus fatalities, which gives me pause about the apparent progress the state has made in When someone dies at home, first responders are called to determine the cause of death and ensure that no foul play was involved before the funeral home receives the deceased. New York City public health spokesman Michael Lanza told That number has been steadily increasing since March 30th, with 241 New Yorkers dying at home Sunday — more than the number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths that occurred citywide that day. On Monday night, the city reported 266 new deaths, suggesting the possibility of a 40% undercount of coronavirus-related deaths.The FDNY says it responded to 2,192 cases of deaths at home between March 20th and April 5th, or about 130 a day, an almost 400 percent increase from the same time period last year. (In 2019, there were just 453 cardiac arrest calls where a patient died, according to the FDNY.)Gwynne Hogan at National ReviewFollow Us",0,Is New York Undercounting Coronavirus Deaths?

No charge.It is hard not to be moved by the videos of Crozier’s adoring sailors cheering him as he left the ship for the last time. Since then, many Americans have rallied to his side; they believe Crozier is paying the price for sticking up for his sailors. But as a fellow Naval Academy graduate and former Naval Officer, I was disappointed to see Crozier place his country at risk at such a vulnerable time. Crozier put his people before himself, but, as an officer, he should have put his nation before both.The military remains America’s most trusted institution in an era when such trust is low and partisan animosity is high. Crozier’s action doesn’t seem politically motivated, but he should have known that half the country, led by much of the media, would cast his decision in a political light, aggravating our political divisions, and even worse, give license to other military leaders to follow suit. With America’s economy sputtering, top investment banks predicting Depression-era unemployment, and a contentious presidential election looming, America is in a fragile state. At times like this, we need our institutions at their strongest.The U.S. Navy is the world’s most important geopolitical institution because it serves as the guarantor of global security. The global order that the Navy maintains ensures that maritime trade flows unmolested. It keeps Russian submarines off our eastern seaboard, China from seizing more of its neighbors’ islands, Iran and Saudi Arabia from all-out war, and oil flowing through the straits of Malacca and Hormuz. Without the U.S. Navy playing this role, the dollar would not long remain the world’s preferred currency. Imagine any of those dominoes falling while COVID-19 paralyzes the U.S. Any weakness in the Navy, whether perceived or actual, has global consequences.There’s no doubt Crozier’s preoccupation with the health of his sailors could have strategic consequences. For one, the On Monday, in an impassioned and at times crude speech over the ship’s PA system, Modly blamed Crozier for causing a political controversy. He also called him “
In his statement on Crozier’s removal, the Acting Secretary of the Navy, Thomas Modly, invokes this conception of duty. He praises Crozier’s character and service, but criticizes his judgement when he says that he “The Constitutional Paradigm is a priority list in which the good of the Navy and country come before the good of the ship. Of course, it is not an algorithm; it’s a framework, a touchstone, without which it would be impossible to navigate the fraught moral complexity of military operations.Moral maturity assumes that officers remain grounded in a paradigm that regularly returns them to their source of duty . . . it’s the Constitutional Paradigm beginning with the US Constitution and moving through the mission, the service [the Navy], the unit (or ship), the fellow-serviceman (or shipmate) and finally self.In basic officer training, every Naval Officer learns what the U.S. Naval Academy’s ADM James B. Stockdale Center for Ethical Leadership calls the The next day, the Acting Secretary of the Navy relieved Crozier of command, but has said Crozier, who has tested positive for the virus, will retain his rank and commission and be reassigned to another unit. His explanation: By using an unsecured channel and going around his chain of command, he had evinced poor judgement. To some, his removal smacks of retribution for insubordination, or worse, partisanship.On March 30th, Captain Crozier, Commanding Officer, made the seemingly innocuous decision to send an unsecured email asking for support from the Navy in his fight against COVID-19 that was ripping through his sailors’ ranks. It was a cry for help, but it doesn’t read like one — its four pages contain a careful analysis of how the measures taken were inadequate and a plan to quarantine the crew in Guam. The letter tells a story of competence and concern; it shows that Crozier had the competence to prevail and that he clearly cared for the welfare of his sailors.<span class=""drop"">H</span>

Their case is about nothing more than whether ballots mailed in the six-day period after Election Day should count. It was not the justices’ decision to go forward with Wisconsin’s primary during a pandemic. Nor is the Court any way responsible for the risks entailed by in-person voting.  
   Still, I’m sympathetic to the dissent in this case. My views notwithstanding, voting by mail is widely permitted. Even for traditionalists, moreover, absentee balloting is permissible in extraordinary circumstances. What could be more extraordinary than the ongoing health crisis? It is being demanded of Americans that they shut down their livelihoods for the greater good of stopping the spread of a deadly infectious disease. How ridiculous, then, that Wisconsin state officials have not canceled in-person voting as other states have done. They should have either made it easier for people to vote by mail or postponed the election until it could safely be held.  
   If I had my druthers, absentee balloting would not be permitted except in extraordinary circumstances. Voting is a sufficiently important privilege that we should all troop to the polling place and cast our ballots on Election Day. This way, we all vote based on the same available information, and the chances of fraud — which is what you should worry about if you are truly concerned about disenfranchisement — are minimized.On the other hand, Justice Ginsburg is at her least persuasive in turning the Justice Ginsburg has a good point about the majority’s reliance on Democratic organizations’ failure to ask for an extension of the mail-in deadline. Oddly, the majority asserts that Ginsburg’s dissent “entirely disregards the critical point that the plaintiffs themselves did not ask for this additional relief in their preliminary injunction motions.” To the contrary, Justice Ginsburg counters that, while the plaintiffs omitted that request from their written motions, Justice Ginsburg dissented (joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan). She argued that the coronavirus crisis had backlogged the Election Commission with mail-in-ballot requests, meaning that many such ballots (potentially thousands of them) would not be provided to voters in time to comply with the April 7 deadline. Ergo, the Court’s ruling needlessly placed voters in the quandary of risking disease by voting in person or forfeiting their right to vote — in an important election in which not only the Democratic presidential nomination but many seats on the Wisconsin state courts, including its highest court, are at stake.Consequently, the majority (Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh) ruled that in order for votes to count, the absentee ballots must be postmarked by Election Day (April 7) and received by the Election Commission by April 13.
There were at least three problems with this resolution. First, when they filed their lawsuit, the Democratic plaintiffs had not asked the district court to permit the mailing of ballots after the polls were closed on April 7. Second, the Wisconsin Election Commission and election inspectors were not parties to the lawsuit, and thus did not have a right to be heard before Judge Conley gagged them. Finally, the district court’s resolution worked a significant change in election rules. This ran afoul of Supreme Court precedent, particularly the 2006 Obviously, this could mean the election would be materially altered by events occurring after formal conclusion of the primary election — not least, news about the apparent election result. To address this problem, Judge Conley further ordered the Wisconsin Election Commission and election inspectors to suppress any report of the voting results until after the new April 13 deadline for the receipt of absentee ballots.The majority’s unsigned opinion explains that the issue the Court was called upon to decide was a narrow one, pertaining to absentee ballots. Specifically, at the urging of Democratic Party organizations concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on voting, federal district judge William Conley (an Obama appointee) extended the deadline for receipt of mail-in ballots from Tuesday April 7 (the primary-election day) to Monday afternoon, April 13.

No charge.Let’s hope scientists also cure the psychopathology that enslaves those who believe that, between COVID-19 and the president, Trump is the bigger danger.Researchers in Wuhan, China, treated 62 COVID-19 patients. Half got HCQ. Half did not. Those who took HCQ saw coughs and fever subside a day sooner than the others. More impressive: Pneumonia decreased among And the Old Gray Lady’s hands must have quaked when she scribbled this headline Wednesday: “Malaria Drug Helps Coronavirus Patients Improve, in Small Study.”Rightly so. On Thursday, Meanwhile, Governor Whitmer flip-flopped like an Olympic diver. She now seeks heaps of HCQ for COVID-stricken Michiganders. “I think that there is some HCQ donations are cascading into the national stockpile: 1 million doses from Bayer, 6 million from Teva, 30 million from Sandoz, and On March 29, the FDA approved HCQ for “Just days after declaring their jihad against HCQ, President Trump’s critics now have been exposed as cruel, heartless, and stupid.Dr. Oz, the director of Columbia University’s Integrative Medicine Center and television host, added: “I’m upset, obviously, because I wanted to do the trial. I also wanted it to be legal in my state for a doctor to talk to a patient about their COVID-19 and treat them as they felt appropriate….We should be allowed to have that discussion with our patients in New York.”“The trial that I was helping with at my institution was shut down when the governor [Cuomo] banned the use of hydroxychloroquine for prescription use for outpatients,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, told host Lou Dobbs last night on the Fox Business Network. “I was trying to see if we could actually treat early disease and replicate what’s been done in China and in France.”Alas, Governor Andrew Cuomo (D., N.Y.) has ordered that doctors cannot prescribe HCQ against COVID-19 and dispense it via pharmacies. Instead, Cuomo has decided, it will be available only via hospitals. Of course, putting patients in hospital beds just so that they can get HCQ will increase pressure on medical centers, which is the last thing doctors and nurses need right now. Likewise, limiting HQC to hospital patients needlessly keeps this drug from those who are insufficiently ill to be admitted to medical centers. Why not let them heal at home, rather than deteriorate without HCQ — if that’s what these patients and their doctors want?Great idea!“Yes. I had C-19,” he recalled. “Within an hour of testing positive, they put me on what I call the Trump Treatment: HCQ and Zithromax. It works great. I went in with bilateral pneumonia. Within two to three days, I felt much better. No fever, no aches, and my appetite and energy were restored. I remained on oxygen, but at a lower level. I was released 10 days after being admitted, and I am still on oxygen at home. I want people who are sick at home to have access to the therapy that cured me.”Vavruska’s doctors soon administered a COVID-19 test.My friend and occasional co-author Charles Vavruska — a school-reform activist in Queens — suffered fever, aches, and fatigue for five days. He eventually went to New York-Presbyterian QueensOne of those who has not died from COVID-19 credits Trump’s “snake oil” for keeping him alive.This is the ultimate in anti-Trump rage: The president thinks something might heal the sick.

No charge.<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong>Given the incubation period of the virus and delays in testing, we won’t know for at least a few weeks how many people were sickened or died in order to vote.Over the last three weeks, Evers’s leadership has been feckless and erratic: He opposed postponing the election until the last-minute, pushed for the type of all-mail election that Republicans have staunchly opposed, and then issued an order he’d previously said he didn’t have the lawful authority to issue. The Republican legislature, meanwhile, wouldn’t budge from its position that Tuesday’s vote should go forward as planned, and refused to propose or entertain any alternatives. That left many voters who didn’t request or receive an absentee ballot early enough with a difficult, dangerous choice on Tuesday. According to city officials, 20,000 voters are expected to show up at Milwaukee’s five polling places, and their experience passing through the same location as thousands of others won’t be anything like that of picking up takeout food.The Just how many voters were effectively shut out of the election remains unclear. In the spring 2019 Supreme Court election, 1.2 million Wisconsinites voted. In the 2016 spring primary that featured competitive Democratic and Republican presidential races, 2.1 million votes were cast.“The state’s highest court has spoken: The governor can’t unilaterally move the date of the election,” Republican legislative leaders Fitzgerald and Vos said in their own statement. “The safety and health of our citizens have always been our highest concern; that’s why we advocated for everyone to vote absentee. Wisconsin has responded in droves.”  
   “People have bled, fought, and died for the right to vote in this country. But tomorrow in Wisconsin, thousands will wake up and have to choose between exercising their right to vote and staying healthy and safe,” Evers said in a statement responding to the ruling.The legislature’s leaders immediately sued, challenging the order as an unconstitutional overreach, and the state Supreme Court ruled 4–2 along ideological lines in their favor. Daniel Kelly, the justice seeking a fresh ten-year term in Tuesday’s election, did not participate in the ruling.Yesterday, Evers did what he’d said all along he had no legal authority to do: He issued an “Hundreds of thousands of workers are going to their jobs every day, serving in essential roles in our society. There’s no question that an election is just as important as getting take-out food,” the GOP’s legislative leaders said in a   
   Last Friday, four days before the election, Evers finally called for it to be postponed until May. Under pressure from mayors, he The city of Milwaukee reported that instead of its 180 polling places, it would be reduced to five polling centers because of a lack of poll workers, forcing thousands of Wisconsinites to form long lines in order to vote. Robin Vos, the Republican leader of the state assembly, In its April 1 report, the The governor’s office has argued that there’s no certain future date when the health crisis would relent. Officials also said that a delay would put at risk hundreds of nonpartisan positions on the ballot — including the mayor of Milwaukee — that under statute would be vacant if the election does not take place on Tuesday. That scenario, the governor’s office said, would create even more chaos amid a public health emergency. But critics say it is a gray area that Evers could have exploited through the Legislature or the courts to find a bridge solution until the health crisis abates.She dismissed the possibility of the governor attempting to halt the election like DeWine did. “It’s not going to happen,” Baldauff said. “He doesn’t want to do it and he also doesn’t have the authority to do it.”“Our democracy is essential, it must go on. Keeping people safe is the governor’s top priority but we want people to participate in this election. We want as many people as possible to vote from home,” Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff told POLITICO. “We hope the Legislature would work with the governor to extend the time for [ballots] to be counted and to be received.”In an April 2 report on Wisconsin Democrats’ anger at Evers’s handling of the issue, “Evers has said he wants all voters to receive an absentee ballot to be able to mail in their vote, and does not want to move the election,” the On March 27, the Republican leader of the state Senate, Scott Fitzgerald, rejected Evers’s all-mail proposal, In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Governor Tony Evers ordered Wisconsin’s schools closed on March 17, and issued a stay-at-home order to state residents on March 24 that is scheduled to last until the end of April.

Solutions that seemed out of reach only a few years or even months ago are now possible</span>The notion of a “beneficial crisis” is a well-used and effective part of the Brussels toolkit. However, throwing the ESM at the problem will not, I suspect, be enough to see the economies of Italy and other euro-zone members most badly hit by the coronavirus safely out of the ruin that COVID-19 will leave behind. Eventually (and only after a lot of shouting) some form of Eurobond — Coronabond, call it what you will — seems inevitable. The ratchet of integration will turn another notch.Translation: Concessions on the way.Translation: She has learnt nothing.The answer can only be: More Europe, a stronger Europe and a well-functioning Europe.So, what’s the next step? Both Angela Merkel and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte have suggested that they would be open to channeling funding through the So far, the leadership of the euro zone’s “frugal four” — Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland — still opposes the issue of any joint debt instrument by the euro zone, even a (supposedly) one-off The European Central Bank has massively increased quantitative easing, announcing the purchase of up to The most feasible way out of this mess — and it’s no magic bullet — would, as it has been for years, be either Germany’sPredicting the demise of the euro is unwise. Designed to be This would be a conundrum at the best of times, and, for the EU, these are not the best of times. Although the political cost/benefit analysis of Brexit to the EU is not straightforward, “ever closer union” has now been definitively been rejected by a major European state. What’s more, while its relationship with euroskepticism is more complicated than is often portrayed, the rise in populism within the EU is hard to square with how the union is currently run. And it is not going away any time soon. Nor will the boost that populism derives from discontent over mass immigration, which may well be sharpened yet again if COVID-19 wreaks havoc in the Middle East and Africa. As it is, the coronavirus has, at least temporarily, brought border controls Italy is not Greece. Greece was small enough to be bailed out, but the decision to do so was bolstered by fears that the wider economic and political cost of a Greek departure from the euro zone would be too great to bear. As the euro zone is managed today, however, Italy, the third largest EU economy, is both too big to fail and too big to bail out.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>COVID-19 (and the measures to combat it) have shut down large swaths of the Italian economy, and, like an immuno-suppressed patient, it is in no state to resist. Just under a week ago, the Italian economy minister was And then along comes COVID-19, which (as I write) has hit Italy hardest of all the euro-zone countries. Human tragedy is being amplified still further by economic distress: The country has never recovered from its decision to join a currency union for which it was fundamentally ill-suited. Burdened by unimpressive productivity and high government indebtedness, it could no longer devalue its way out of difficulty with the lira gone. Italy was thus in trouble even before the devastation inflicted during the euro-zone crisis, devastation that has yet to be fully repaired. We violated all the rules.These divisions have not gone away. Indeed, the bailouts strengthened suspicions in the north concerning any sort of fiscal union (except under terms that the “south” would find unpalatable), suspicions that extend to the issue of “eurobonds” (in this sense), bonds that would be guaranteed by the euro zone’s members as a whole, and thus carry a lower rate of interest than government debt issued, say, by Italy alone. Even with some of the safeguards that have, on various occasions, been proposed should be built into such bonds, Germany and its allies have continued to reject them, fearing that, safeguards or no safeguards, they would end up being required to chip in. Precedent would suggest that their concerns are justified:The euro zone’s rescue systems were soon put on a sounder legal footing, but the lack of trust that had characterized the debate over the single currency’s establishment resurfaced during the discussions over bailouts intended to preserve it. The more financially disciplined states, generally in the euro zone’s north, felt that, despite repeated assurances that this could never happen, they were now being compelled to bail out the improvident. They were right. Meanwhile the countries in receipt of assistance believed that it was being delivered on terms that did not reflect the economic reality of what they were facing. And for the most part they were right too.Lagarde went on to run the IMF, weathered a conviction for We violated all the rules because we wanted to close ranks and really rescue the euro zone . . . The Treaty of Lisbon was very straight-forward. No bailout.When, as it was always going to, the euro-zone crisis finally erupted, the same issues arose, but the pre-existing distrust was reinforced by the cavalier manner in which the early rescue effort was arranged. As tThis simple, unsayable fact is at the root of the dysfunction that was baked into the euro from the very beginning. The single currency was wildly premature on any number of grounds, but to launch the euro without some elements of a fiscal union to underpin it added recklessness to arrogance. Those, at least in Brussels, in charge of the project would doubtless have preferred just such an addition both politically and economically, but there was not enough national support for that, not least in Germany, the country that was key to the credibility of the new currency. There were plenty of good reasons for that resistance (the mistake was to proceed regardless), but one of the most significant was the unwillingness of some countries to pool, even if only partially (and/or contingently), financial risk with fellow member-states they did not trust to run their own affairs responsibly. Being on the hook for feckless Uncle Georg would be hard enough to swallow, but second cousin (once removed) Giorgio, well, no.The unsayable is even more unsayable when it is true. Brussels may look down on the nation-state as dangerous anachronism, but it is, however imperfectly, a family in a way that the EU is not. The European “family” did not exist in 2011, and it does not exist in 2020. None of this is to deny that there is a certain degree of fellow-feeling among the EU’s “citizens,” but for most of them, it only goes so far, which was Wulff’s point. To Bavarians, Saxons are family in a way that Greeks are not.Solidarity is the core of the European Idea, but it is a misunderstanding to measure solidarity in terms of willingness to act as guarantor or to incur shared debts. With whom would you be willing to take out a joint loan, or stand as guarantor? For your own children? Hopefully yes. For more distant relations it gets a bit more difficult . . .<span class=""drop"">I</span>

Still, in times of crisis, we should unite around our common values as Americans.

For this reason, I have never understood why we throw people behind bars for being involved with substances the government has deemed “criminal” (though I’m aware people view this position as somehow radical). There should be no controversy, however, about the freedom to try potentially life-saving drugs. When a person is gravely ill with a life-threatening, fast-progressing illness — one lacking other treatments — denying access to an experimental treatment simply because it isn’t “proven,” is not just draconian, but also asinine. It’s been disappointing to see that more Americans aren’t shouting this from the rooftops.My view on this has little to do with my view of the drug itself.

But the court reached that conclusion only by grossly misreading GA-09 as an “outright ban” on all pre-viability abortions. Properly understood, GA-09 merely postpones certain non-essential abortions, an emergency measure that does not plainly violate <em>Casey</em> in the context of an escalating public health crisis</strong>As the state’s infectious disease expert points out, “[g]iven the risk of transmission in health care settings” there is “a sound basis for limiting all surgeries except those that are immediately medically necessary so as to prevent the spread of COVID 19.” In sum, it cannot be maintained on the record before us that GA-09 bears “no real or substantial relation” to the state’s goal of protecting public health in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.To be sure, GA-09 is a drastic measure, but that aligns it with the numerous drastic measures Petitioners and other states have been forced to take in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Faced with exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, states have closed schools, sealed off nursing homes, banned social gatherings, quarantined travelers, prohibited churches from holding public worship services, and locked down entire cities. These measures would be constitutionally intolerable in ordinary times, but are recognized as appropriate and even necessary responses to the present crisis. So, too, GA-09.Our own review of the record easily confirms that conclusion. GA-09 is supported by findings that (1) “a shortage of hospital capacity or personal protective equipment would hinder efforts to cope with the COVID-19 disaster,” and (2) “hospital capacity and personal protective equipment are being depleted by surgeries and procedures that are not medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition or to preserve the life of a patient.” The order also references, and reinforces, the Governor’s prior executive order, GA-08, “aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19.” Accordingly, GA-09 instructs licensed health care professionals and facilities to postpone non-essential surgeries and procedures until 11:59 p.m. on April 21, 2020. For their part, Respondents appear to concede the validity of GA-09 as a general matter: they recognize that Texas faces an “unprecedented public health crisis” and that “[g]overnment officials and medical professionals expect a surge of infections that will test the limits of a health care system already facing a shortage of PPE.”The first Moreover, the district court’s refusal to acknowledge or apply <strong>That analysis is backwards: <em>Jacobson</em> instructs that all constitutional rights may be reasonably restricted to combat a public health emergency. We could avoid applying <em>Jacobson</em> here only if the Supreme Court had specifically exempted abortion rights from its general rule. It has never done so. To the contrary, the Court has repeatedly cited <em>Jacobson</em> in abortion cases without once suggesting that abortion is the only right exempt from limitation during a public health emergency.</strong>By all accounts, then, the effect on abortion arising from a state’s emergency response to a public health crisis must be analyzed under the standards in <em>Jacobson</em><strong>The bottom line is this: when faced with a society-threatening epidemic, a state may implement emergency measures that curtail constitutional rights so long as the measures have at least some “real or substantial relation” to the public health crisis and are not “beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law.”</strong><em>Jacobson</em>To be sure, individual rights secured by the Constitution do not disappear during a public health crisis, but the Court plainly stated that rights could be reasonably restricted during those times. Importantly, the Court narrowly described the scope of judicial authority to review rights-claims under these circumstances: review is “only” available if a statute purporting to have been enacted to protect the public health, the public morals, or the public safety, has no real or substantial relation to those objects, or is, beyond all question, a plain, palpable invasion of rights secured by the fundamental law. Elsewhere, the Court similarly described this review as asking whether power had been exercised in an “arbitrary, unreasonable manner” or through “arbitrary and oppressive” regulations.“[I]n every well-ordered society charged with the duty of conserving the safety of its members the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times, under the pressure of great dangers, be subjected to such restraint, to be enforced by reasonable regulations, as the safety of the general public may demand.” …In Here is an extended excerpt from the majority’s discussion of In sum, given the extraordinary nature of these errors, the escalating spread of COVID-19, and the state’s critical interest in protecting the public health, we find the requirements for issuing the writ satisfied. See Third, the district court usurped the state’s authority to craft emergency health measures. Instead, the court substituted its own view of the efficacy of applying GA-09 to abortion. But “[i]t is no part of the function of a court” to decide which measures are “likely to be the most effective for the protection of the public against disease.” Second, the district court’s result was patently wrong. Instead of applying First, the district court ignored the framework governing emergency public health measures like GA-09. See The “drastic and extraordinary” remedy of mandamus is warranted for several reasons.To preserve critical medical resources during the escalating COVID-19 pandemic, on March 22, 2020, the Governor of Texas issued executive order GA-09, which postpones non-essential surgeries and procedures until 11:59 p.m. on April 21, 2020. Reading GA-09 as an “outright ban” on pre-viability abortions, on March 30 the district court issued a temporary restraining order against GA-09 as applied to abortion procedures.

The overall relief bill tried too hard to micromanage relationships between employers and employees, and it has been marred by all the pushing and pulling on private actors with incentives. If Congress tries to tackle it again, it should just use the power of the purse to give directly to private actors. Help businesses pay their fixed costs, but let them decide which employees they want to incentivize to stay on. Or let individuals decide how to use the money themselves, whether they buy Netflix subscriptions or stock up on books and digital classes to deal with the sudden onset of home schooling.Perhaps more controversially, the normal FDA regulations could be waived to allow for more radical treatment, even experimentation on humans. The ethical rules that prevent large payments, or prevent risk-takers from filling the ranks of clinical trials, make sense in the normal course of events but less so in a global pandemic, where nearly everyone is making a sacrifice for public health.A pandemic involving a “novel” virus is also a perfect argument for the implementation of “right to try” laws. For years libertarians have been advocating that people suffering from truly acute conditions and facing mortal peril should have a right to try drugs and therapies that are still in development or remain unapproved for general use. Some would push it toward allowing access to try some radical therapies at the bleeding edge of medical speculation. We are seeing a light-touch version of this as doctors and patients scramble to come up with treatment protocols for COVID-19 where none exist.The crisis has tended to show the strength of nimble and flexible governments such as those of Taiwan and Singapore. These aren’t libertarian paradises by any means, but their bureaucracy tends to be lighter-touch in practice. And under the pressure of the virus, other governments are adapting to do the same. FDA regulations that impede the development of new drugs and vaccines and authorize research trials have also been amended or waived in recent weeks.
That’s not the only regulatory net that had to be cut. State departments of health, in the race to find hospital space and ventilators, cut all kinds of regulations that make health care more expensive and cumbersome to deliver. Patients could share ventilators in a crisis. Licensing red tape that would normally stop advanced medical students or retired doctors and nurses from working on the medical front lines was waived away to relieve exhausted workforces.And libertarian insights are finally being applied to good effect. For instance, even in a national emergency, we need competition. The But this national conservative would like to acknowledge loud and clear that the COVID-19 crisis is also a libertarian moment. Just as nations seek out self-sufficiency, so too do individuals. And an individualist streak has been necessary for probing and rejecting the dubious or outright fraudulent advice of public-health authorities, corrupted by either Chicoms or groupthink.And contemplating America’s lack of access to key pharmaceuticals, and even medical equipment, some analysts are reviving long-dead concepts such as “autarky,” meaning economic independence and self-sufficiency.Some other things are clear too. China seems to be proving that economic liberalization does not imply or oblige political liberalization.<span class=""drop"">S</span>

No charge.But Medicare for All would not have spared us the pain of this pandemic.Obviously, the United States health-care system needs to do better. We need to rethink our attachment to employer-provided insurance, and we may need to do a better job of subsidizing health care for those who can’t afford it. Certificate-of-need laws should be repealed and the scope of practice expanded for allied health professionals. We should make it easier for foreign doctors to practice here, and rein in the FDA. We can and should learn from the failures of our response to this crisis.The really galling fact is that, even after those cuts, Sanders’s plan would still cost more than $36 trillion over the next ten years. How, exactly, do we expect to pay for that? Having just passed a $2 trillion stimulus to deal with the pandemic and its economic fallout, are we going to borrow more? Are we going to impose new taxes on businesses that are struggling to come back from the brink? While some low-income workers and small businesses might come out ahead on net, since they wouldn’t have to pay premiums, the overall cost would place an enormous burden on the economy at a time when we can least afford to do so.The U.S. is often criticized for spending far more on health care than other countries. In part, this is because most single-payer systems hold down costs by imposing capital controls in order to limit overall health-care spending. This can, in turn, limit the availability of hospital beds and life-saving equipment such as ventilators. In normal times, the there’s a legitimate debate to be had about whether the U.S. overconsumes health care. But when a pandemic hits, those extra resources can make a huge difference — and Bernie Sanders’s Medicare-for-All plan would, according to analysts, require a 40 percent reduction in reimbursements to health-care providers, almost certainly leading to fewer doctors, nurses, and hospital beds.Britain’s National Health Service didn’t come into this crisis in much better shape. The NHS has long had a problem handling even outbreaks of the flu; during the 2018–19 flu season in Britain, one out of four patients waited more than four hours in an emergency room, and 11 percent of ambulances transporting patients were forced to wait outside the hospital for 30 minutes or longer.In Canada, often pointed to as a model by Medicare for All advocates, nearly half of Ontario’s acute-care hospitals were over 100 percent capacity during the first six months of last year. Roughly a quarter of the province’s hospitals average more than 100 percent of capacity. Pity the poor health-care professional who must respond to a pandemic when his hospital is already stuffed to the gills with patients.According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, the United States has the most ICU beds per capita of any country studied; Italy has only two-thirds as many, and 11 percent fewer ventilators.
Indeed, by some metrics we may have been better positioned to absorb a crisis like this one than many other countries.While some countries, especially in Asia, have responded better than others, that appears to be as much a question of tactics as of systemic design. In Europe, government-run, socialized health-care systems from Italy to Spain have been every bit as overwhelmed as ours, if not more so. One should be skeptical of death rates, given the many well-documented limitations of the currently available data, but, notably, some countries with government-run health care have reported higher mortality rates than the U.S.The United States was certainly unprepared for a pandemic of this magnitude and has been slow and disorganized in responding to it. But the most egregious errors have actually been made by government organizations, from the FDA to the CDC to FEMA, while many of the breakthroughs that we’ve seen, such as rapid tests, potential treatments, and possible vaccines, have originated in the private sector. We might have seen even quicker results from the private sector without the government regulations and bureaucracy that slowed it down. Does anyone really believe that we should put the same government that can’t manage the acquisition and delivery of ventilators and personal protective equipment in charge of even more of our health-care decisions?But before we all rush off to join the Bernie Bros., maybe we should ask whether Medicare for All would really have made dealing with the Coronavirus easier.<span class=""drop"">A</span>

It raised alarms because an out-of-control disease would pose a serious threat to U.S. forces in Asia, forces that depend on the National Center for Medical Intelligence’s work.As far back as late November, U.S. intelligence officials were warning that a contagion was sweeping through China’s Wuhan region, changing the patterns of life and business and posing a threat to the population, according to four sources briefed on the secret reporting.I find <strong>Just When Were the First Cases and First Reports of COVID-19?</strong>The But the research on bats and coronaviruses continued at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where the declarations and funding leverage of the National Institutes of Health held no sway. And that research continues at the institute to this day.But what this does tell us is that the Obama administration and U.S. National Institutes of Health were sufficiently worried about scientists working on these types of viruses, and the risk of an accidental release of one of these viruses, to halt federal funding for this research. They were also sufficiently worried about an accidental release to encourage anyone not taking federal funding to halt their work as well. They had good reason to be; in addition to the cases at the U.S. CDC and FDA, the Chinese CDC’s National Institute of Virology in southern Beijing had accidentally released SARS. Apparently, some folks look at this sequence of events and conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is bioengineered. As laid out in previous newsletters and articles, too many virologists, biologists, and genome researchers say that simply cannot be the case with the virus that is attacking the world right now. The “engineering” would be too difficult to hide, and other genomic researchers would see the metaphorical “fingerprints” of the alteration of naturally occurring traits.<a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/04/coronavirus-china-trail-leading-back-to-wuhan-labs/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">You may recognize Zhengli Shi as the Chinese researcher nicknamed “Bat Woman” for her work with the animals.</a>Fourteen other scientists worked with Baric on this project — mostly others at UNC, but also from the Switzerland Institute of Microbiology and Harvard Medical School.

Although the extent of any risk is difficult to assess, Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, points out that the researchers have created a novel virus that “grows remarkably well” in human cells. “If the virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory,” he says.They developed a hybrid virus combining the traits of SARS and other another type of coronavirus. Articles at the time Ralph Baric, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, last week (November 9) published a study on his team’s efforts to engineer a virus with the surface protein of the SHC014 coronavirus, found in horseshoe bats in China, and the backbone of one that causes human-like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in mice. The hybrid virus could infect human airway cells and caused disease in mice, according to the team’s results, which were published in But there was a project that did not pause, and argued it was effectively “grandfathered in” under the old rules before the pause.

The numbers in Michigan and California are troubling, because they may be undercounting cases. Michigan is on a dangerous trajectory, and it may see a severe outbreak if it cannot administer as many tests as New York and Louisiana.U.S. testing has increased over the past week but fell on Sunday and Tuesday. It is unclear whether that decline reflects limited capacity or a decrease in testing due to reductions in cases. By some estimates, the U.S. will need to administer 2 million tests a day to roll back social-distancing measures.

It can’t spend government tax dollars on prayer, on promoting religion [or] proselytization. That directly contradicts the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

The Trump administration has issued guidance reinforcing Hawley’s assertion, but already some opponents are arguing that religious groups should not be eligible for federal aid.The following day, Hawley sent a subsequent letter, asking the SBA to clarify that religious organizations are permitted to seek relief from the Paycheck Protection Program. “It is unacceptable that your agencies’ guidance would leave uncertain their ability to gain the relief to which they are entitled by the law Congress passed,” he wrote. “Moreover, the Constitution demands that the government may not discriminate against these religious nonprofits on account of their religious status—whether they engage in sectarian activities or not—in providing this public benefit.”“Three years ago, in Less than a week later, much of what Hawley wrote seems to be coming true.

The pandemic has relegated the Biden campaign to incoherent blather broadcast from the candidate’s basement. But the show must go on. The Democrats’ election theme is “Trump is incorrigibly corrupt.” If propping up that theme requires portraying the president as warring against watchdogs, or self-dealing on medications, then that’s what they’ll do.The president remains impetuous and unapologetic. In response, Democrats and their media allies are sure to spend the next week or three haranguing the country about the critical importance and non-partisan scrupulousness of inspectors general, in much the same way “the Resistance” lionized federal bureaucrats throughout the Mueller probe and the Ukraine kerfuffle. Why not? It is a more promising angle than another of this week’s TDS outbreaks: We’re to believe that Trump is touting hydroxychloroquine as an off-brand therapeutic against COVID-19 not because he wants to save lives, but because he has a small financial interest in a French pharmaceutical company that makes the anti-malarial drug.The president added fuel to the fire at Monday’s coronavirus press conference with an outburst against the acting IG of the Health and Human Services Department. Christi A. Grimm, the acting IG, was not referred to by name during Trump’s angry exchanges with two reporters. But she was made central to the exchanges, which involved an HHS IG report about blatant government failures in coronavirus testing, particularly at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Unaware of the details of the report, which did not criticize the Trump administration, the president intimated that Grimm must be a partisan Obama plant. Actually, she is a 20-year HHS official, promoted up the ranks under administrations of both parties.Trump’s removal of Fine from the PRAC is being folded into a new narrative: President Trump’s jihad against “government watchdogs.” The storyline prominently includes the president’s firing of the Intelligence Community’s inspector general, Michael Atkinson. But that is a special case, involving an official who was entangled in the impeachment fiasco. Atkinson’s handling of the so-called whistleblower complaint and his later congressional testimony about it have raised questions that remain unanswered. Moreover, his interpretation of the controlling statute was not as uncontroversial as the media and Democrats intimate (This is the way this game works. Democratic administrations come into office and exploit the patronage (as they are entitled to do), sweeping out Republicans and getting their own people in place. The press reliably describes this as a much-needed injection of new progressive blood in the government’s veins. By contrast, when Republican presidents remove Democratic appointees, journalists wail about the invasion of “loyalists” and wistfully recall a noble bipartisan past, when new presidents retained the much-needed expertise of “non-partisan” (ahem) bureaucrats.He was not gone for long. As detailed above, President Obama recruited Fine for DoD in 2015. He has been in the IG’s office there ever since.In doing so, Clinton banked on his Republican successor’s inclination to extend a bipartisan olive branch after the historically contentious 2000 election. President Bush did not disappoint, keeping Fine rather than nominating his own DOJ IG. Predictably, Fine was a Upon taking office in 1993, President Clinton famously fired Republican appointees throughout the executive branch, including nearly every district U.S. attorney. By contrast, on his way out the door eight years later, he shrewdly installed Fine as the Justice Department’s inspector general.A Pentagon spokeswoman curtly announced, “Mr. Fine is no longer on the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.”
The president did this by replacing Fine at DoD with Sean O’Donnell, who is currently the Environmental Protection Agency’s IG. Trump also nominated Jason Abend to become DoD’s IG. Pending Abend’s confirmation, O’Donnell will be DoD’s acting IG while continuing to wear his EPA IG hat. Meanwhile, if Fine chooses to stay in government, he will revert to his former position as DoD’s deputy IG. That is the job in which President Obama installed him in 2015. Fine became DoD’s acting IG the next year, but he was never confirmed.Last week, what the The $2 trillion bill signed by the president in March creates an $80 million fiefdom known as the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. The PRAC will audit government spending. By law, its chairman must be an inspector general or acting inspector general of one of the executive branch departments or agencies.

Quite possibly, which means I am desperately longing for when I can get back to the pub to drown my sorrows.One gentleman named Keith phoned a BBC radio call-in show last week and swiftly demanded that the police shoot people going to sit in the sun for a few moments. The presenter quickly moved on from his contribution in typically embarrassed English style, but I am sure there were thousands of listeners nodding along, possibly remarking upon what a smart and insightful proposition Keith had offered. Let’s hope that the police at least fail to sway to this particular strand of public opinion. For reasons far beyond the capacity of my imagination, Morgan is a popular figure. His voice is one of many in a particularly forceful chorus calling for the police to be sharper. The police have pandered to the authoritarian urges of public opinion, failing to abide by impartial service to the law. They have failed this principle. A host of popular media figures has been demanding tighter restrictions, with shock jock extraordinaire Piers Morgan — who once polluted American screens on his ghastly CNN show — being particularly vociferous. He has regularly called people relaxing in London parks “traitors” and urged severe punishment.For reasons of succinctness, I won’t list them all. But my favorite is the fifth, which commands policemen to “seek and preserve public favour, not by pandering to public opinion; but by constantly demonstrating absolutely impartial service to law.”This is intolerable. British police are governed by the beautiful and freedom-preserving philosophy of policing by consent, which refers to the Peelian principles. Named after Prime Minister Robert Peel — the “father of modern policing” — the nine principles were issued to every officer from 1829 onward.Police have also taken to cycling around London parks and telling off citizens for enjoying “non-essential exercise,” such as a brief stroll and rest in the sun in a park away from their cramped and miserable flats. Just last week, a woman was fined £660 for being at Newcastle Central train station and “failing to provide identity or reasons for travel to police.” She soon found out that this crime doesn’t exist.How quickly we have lapsed into statism.Derbyshire police have been using drones to keep the eye of the state on people wandering to beauty spots — an action I remember mocking the CCP for doing just a few months ago. One clip, which they gleefully shared on Twitter, showed two people pausing for an “unnecessary selfie” while taking a “non-essential walk.”So, is it just a few reporting portals, set up so the police can satisfy the all-seeing informants who want to “do their bit” in the fight against the virus? It is with profound regret that I can report that it gets much, much worse.And they’re not alone. A portal from Humberside police asks you to give details on people who are “not following social-distancing rules.” Police forces in the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, and Avon and Somerset have launched online forms and phone lines to clamp down on people gathering.Cambridgeshire police tweeted: “We have now developed an online form allowing you to report individuals breaching Covid-19 restrictions via our website.” The account shared a webpage where people can give details about a person or organization ignoring the rules.Not wanting to miss out on an opportunity to embarrass themselves in public, many of our overzealous police forces have launched online contact forms so people can grass on their neighbors. Some of these portals were launched because police control rooms were “inundated” with calls from nosy neighbors. It seems many are only too keen to fill them out when they spot someone sneaking out for a quick stroll.Northamptonshire — which I now rank as one of England’s bottom three counties — has reported a thriving snitching community, with its chief constable, Nick Adderly, recently revealing that the force has faced a surge in calls from people reporting their neighbors for “going out for a second run.”
A little over two weeks ago, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced tougher restrictions on our liberty to prevent the spread of the virus. “Stay home and save lives” was his rallying cry. Unfortunately, many took this to mean “Stay home and make sure your neighbor does the same.”He has been proven right. The coronavirus epidemic has revealed that vast swaths of our society need little incentive to transform into curtain-twitching, proto-Stasi informants.He told me I was wrong, and that we’re just as ripe for the Germanic grassing (informing) that we both lamented.By contrast, Britain, I said, can take great pride from our national attitude against tattletales, which starts in the school playground before fermenting into full-blown opposition to informing on neighbors when the police come knocking.<span class=""drop"">B</span>

No charge.Incorporating China into the global order was supposed to bring about an internal reform of the Chinese Communist Party and the liberalization of the Chinese state and society. Instead, China has used its access to international institutions to whitewash its behavior, spread propaganda about the competence of its state, corrupt business, and make something as simple as cellphone towers a national-security threat. The Chinese Communist Party has infected global institutions and markets with its amorality and lawlessness. The cure will be tough and costly, but the disease is worse.There is even a moral corruption that spreads from China to American companies and consumers. As part of its attempt at cultural genocide of Muslims around Kashgar in the west of China, a program was introduced to spread Muslim workers around China on rotation. These half-imprisoned victims of persecution The China problem in international organizations goes beyond internationalist institutions in which the Chinese state is a member; it goes to Chinese-backed enterprises that act as arms of the Chinese state. Using the vast resources of the state, telecom company Huawei has been able to clear the field of other competitors and muscle up against Ericsson for dominance of the European mobile-phone market. What goes for the World Health Organization goes for the World Trade Organization and many other bodies of international cooperation. Trump has made a half-hearted attempt to improve Chinese behavior on intellectual-property theft and other forms of corporate spying, with a trade war. The results are inconclusive. In truth, the scale of the problem requires a solution that is even larger and more comprehensive than the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was — despite some flaws — a genuine attempt to strengthen Asian trading partners that played by the rules.
WHO’s prevarication, and its dangerous obsequiousness toward Beijing, powerfully illustrate a truth: International organizations will always reflect the great-power realities among their members. The worse an actor China becomes on the world stage, the less effective these institutions become. The current director-general of WHO got his job because of Chinese lobbying on his behalf.Bruce Aylward, who led the joint WHO-China mission on COVID-19, has been sycophantic in the extreme. He pretends not to hear questions when they involve Taiwan. He has praised China to the point of Why? We’ve seen how the pressure the Chinese Communist Party exerts on the World Health Organization corrupts its functioning. China was not transparent, and it worked with outside officials only under duress. There is good circumstantial evidence China knew of COVID-19’s transmissibility in December, but it was almost the end of January before the world knew this. All the while, the World Health Organization issued boot-licking statements praising China’s response to the outbreak.Donald Trump and the COVID-19 crisis have conspired to put this form of globalization under question. Trump has said that the World Health Organization “missed the call” while threatening to cut off its funding, and that the health organization “really blew it” while Marco Rubio called for the resignation of WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saying “he allowed Beijing to use the WHO to mislead the global community.”<span class=""drop"">I</span>

But part of it may During this COVID-19 crisis, the rate of ventilator usage increase has gone down and remains well below projections.

   We can ridicule the idea of Americans again making their own things and call it protectionism or economic chauvinism. We can conduct endless congressional inquiries about who said what and when about the virus, and perhaps reopen impeachment.We can scapegoat and play the blame game. We can talk not of an America in crisis, but of the virus’ effects on particular groups. We can decide that it is mean or even racist and xenophobic to hold the Chinese government accountable for its swath of viral destruction — and so we will not.Our other choice is to keep bickering and suffering amnesia, remaining as vulnerable as we were in the past.One, we can wake up as we did on December 8, 1941, to ensure that Americans control their own fundamentals of life — food, fuel, medicine, and strategic industries — without dependency on illiberal regimes. The military can refocus our defenses against nuclear missiles, cyberwarfare, and biological weapons. On the home front, diversity is fine, but in a national crisis as serious as this one, the unity that arises from confidence in shared American citizenship saves lives.Post-virus America can awake from this epidemic and economic shutdown in one of two different ways.Is it prudent to release precious irrigation water out to the Pacific Ocean when California is the richest and most diverse producer of food in America?Does the United States really wish to curtail fracking, which has made it the largest producer of natural gas in the world and ensured that a quarantined America has plenty of fuel?Does the U.S. really need almost 15,000 people flying in from China each day? At a time when American students owe $1.5 trillion in student loans, it is smart to have some 360,000 Chinese students enrolled in U.S. colleges? Is it safe to fund hundreds of labs on university campuses that conduct joint research with Chinese academics?The American public is already asking tough questions.There are other vows to recalibrate our relationship with China to ensure that when the next successor to SARS and COVID-19 hits, American lives will not be jeopardized by the duplicity of the Chinese government. At the beginning of the outbreak, Beijing hid the origins, nature, and transmissibility of the virus, then lied about its supposedly brilliant control of the epidemic.Politicians promise that major industries — pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, rare earths, military technologies — will return home to create millions of new jobs and better protect the population in times of crisis.As we struggle to defeat the coronavirus, an aroused America is talking grandly of restructuring the U.S. economy.More incredible, by the end of 1944, the American gross domestic product exceeded the economic output of all the major belligerents on both sides of World War II put together: the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Italy, and Germany.The U.S. Navy ended the war with a fleet eight times larger than it was at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The American armada would become larger in total tonnage that all the world’s fleets in 1945 combined.The U.S. started the war with seven fleet aircraft carriers and one escort carrier. By war’s end, it was deploying 27 fleet and 72 escort carriers.
In 1940, there were fewer than 500,000 service members in the U.S. military. At the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, that number had grown to nearly 2.2 million. By 1945, more than 12 million Americans were in the armed services. It was an astonishing mobilization for a nation of fewer than 140 million people.They were right.Yamamoto summed up a general feeling among the Japanese admirals that the huge industrial capacity of the U.S. — which had been asleep during the Great Depression — along with the righteous anger and frenzy of an aroused American democracy would ensure the destruction of the Japanese Empire in short order.But Yamamoto likely either wrote or said something similar: “I can run wild for six months . . . after that, I have no expectation of success.”<span class=""drop"">M</span>

It’s far more critical to note that neither the Senate, nor the House, nor the White House, nor federal courts have any business compelling states to adopt uniform standards regarding mail in ballots or IDs or voting machines, or much of anything else. A national mail vote is meant to federalize the election, leaving smaller states to vagaries of a national majority. It’s exactly the kind of situation the Constitution wanted us to avoid.As a practical matter, requiring states, all of which have varied systems, technologies and infrastructures, to figure out how to handle mail-in ballot systems in the midst of a pandemic is absurd. And not merely because the obvious feasibility problems, but because there is no proper time to debate the issue. Democrats have spent years weakening the integrity of elections, but voting by mail opens up the process to real-world voter intimidation, disenfranchisement, fraud — and a host of other problems.Now, I don’t know what experts Biden is referencing, but She’s not alone. In “Phase 4” of the coronavirus rescue package, Democratic leaders are Senator Elizabeth Warren has already But make no mistake, the Wisconsin case will be used in the broader effort to federalize and centralize elections to create a more direct democracy — even though such effort are antithetical to American governance.If Wisconsinites don’t like their laws, if they’re disappointed in legislators, if they’re furious at the state’s high court, and they’re bothered by the governor’s ineptitude, there will be plenty of future elections to right those wrongs. In no version of a healthy “democracy,” however, do we override existing laws, passed by previous elected officials, through fiat.None of this is to say that the situation in Wisconsin is fair to voters, who had to risk standing in lines during a dangerous pandemic. Many states have contingencies in place for emergencies. Wisconsin — while it had plenty of time to pass new guidelines — does not. That’s a Wisconsin problem, not a Supreme Court problem, not a “democracy” problem, and definitely not a federal problem.The Court doesn’t exist to fix your local government’s incompetence or make life safer. It exists to uphold the Constitution.The Court’s decision on the narrow question before the Court should not be viewed as expressing an opinion on the broader question of whether to hold the election, or whether other reforms or modifications in election procedures in light of COVID–19 are appropriate. That point cannot be stressed enough.The Supreme Court did nothing of the sort, as Liberal pundits, apparently unable differentiate between partisan policy preferences and the rule of law, launched into their customary hysterics, denouncing the Supreme Court for disenfranchised minorities and putting people’s lives at risk.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Not that any of this concerned the usual suspects, who began lamenting the alleged anti-democratic nature of Roberts Court. When will the conservative wing abandon their partisanship and begin “compromising” If these dictates had been allowed to stand, they would have created insanely destructive precedents, taking elections out of the hands of local legislatures. If we discard legal norms every time there’s a crisis, we no longer have a nation of laws, but a country at the mercy of arbitrary decrees, emotional appeals, and pliable courts.By forcing Wisconsin to keep voting alive for nearly a week after they were meant to close, the district court realized that late voters would have information regarding election results, so it tried to shut down legally mandated reporting requirements. Sandefur tells me thatAnd as Timothy Sandefur, Vice President for Litigation at the Goldwater Institute, points outThis week, the Supreme Court ruled that a federal court was not empowered to overwrite Wisconsin’s election laws and force the state to accept ballots without any postmark deadline nearly a week after the election.

So when God wanted to give the heirs of his promise an even clearer demonstration of the immutability of his purpose, he intervened with an oath, so that by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge might be strongly encouraged to hold fast to the hope that lies before us.<strong>ADDENDA</strong>President Trump announced restrictions on travelers from Europe on March 11. By that point, Italy had more than 12,000 known cases.By January 31, Hong Kong and Italy had declared states of emergency, Mongolia, Russia, and Vietnam had closed their borders with China, most Asian countries had barred entry to Chinese tourists, and most airlines had canceled flights to Chinese cities.But by the time the president announced the travel restrictions on China, the coronavirus had spread well beyond that country; those who were unknowingly infected were still going to be entering the United States from other countries. And But a lot of Trump fans prefer to focus upon that action because there weren’t many other actions, and the implication is that based on what was known at the time, that action was sufficient. Many other countries had determined that there were already coronavirus cases in their borders. The first coronavirus case had been announced in Washington State on January 15, two weeks earlier.While Biden never explicitly said, “We should not have this travel restriction in place,” he certainly didn’t offer any comment that suggested this was the correct move, and the rote denunciation of Trump’s “hysterical xenophobia” would easily leave audiences thinking that the travel restrictions from China were an irrational overreaction, driven by anti-Chinese animus.We have right now a crisis with the coronavirus emanating from China a national emergency, and, you know, worldwide alerts. The American people need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it; that he is going to act rationally about it. And moments like this, this is where credibility of a president is most needed as he explains what we should and should not do. This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia — hysterical xenophobia — and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science.The strongest step President Trump took during that time was the January 31 rulings that all Americans returning from China had to quarantine for 14 days, instituting health screening at three international airports, and declaring that foreign nationals, other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled in China within the last 14 days will be denied entry into the United States for this time. That’s not nothing, and it is worth remembering, I find the argument about whether President Trump did enough as the coronavirus approached or not pretty tiresome. In January and February, <strong>No, Trump Did Not Take Sufficient Steps to Prepare America in Late Winter</strong>While it’s possible that the NCMI is engaged in some sort of sinister cover-up, it’s also possible the center detected the Wuhan outbreak and wrote reports on this sometime in December, and ABC’s sources are just misremembering when it happened. ABC is running with the angle that hits the Trump administration hardest — “parts of our government knew of the threat in NOVEMBER!” — when the accurate angle is almost as effective — “parts of our government knew of the threat in DECEMBER!”. What’s revealing is that, as far as we can tell from the ABC report on the page, they didn’t know this contradicted the “As a matter of practice, the National Center for Medical Intelligence does not comment publicly on specific intelligence matters. However, in the interest of transparency during this current public health crisis, we can confirm that media reporting about the existence/release of a National Center for Medical Intelligence Coronavirus-related product/assessment Speaking of timelines, our Dan McLaughlin noticed that the Pentagon’s National Center for Medical Intelligence “The only mention of Dr. Li Wenliang in the Chinese government’s timeline is on March 19, marking the Wuhan Public Security Bureau’s decision to revoke the previous reprimand letter and apologize to Li’s family over the mistake. Someone who read this timeline as their only source of information on the virus would have no idea who this doctor was or why the security bureau reprimanded him or subsequently apologized.I guess that timeline depends on how the Chinese government defines “late,” as the Chinese CDC itself previously said If you want a good laugh, compare <strong>The Chinese Government’s Fictional Timeline</strong>By the way, the Notice that the United States has shut down, by one estimate, 82 percent of all U.S. The only ways that those wet markets and China’s wild animal trade get shut down are the governments of the rest of the world get together and force Beijing to shut them down — with regular access to outside observers to ensure they stay shut down — or some sort of dramatic change in the government of China.Still, the NPC’s decision didn’t cover the trade of exotic animals for use in traditional Chinese medicines, fashion or entertainment. Chinese medicine holds that some exotic animals have health benefits and has helped fuel the illegal smuggling and trade of species like the endangered pangolin, whose scales are believed to cure a variety of ailments.Under pressure in February as the virus spread, the National People’s Congress announced a ban on trading wild terrestrial animals for the purpose of eating.That report also notes:In Wuhan, the wet markets are open again, although I can’t believe China doesn’t have debilitating mass food poisoning on a regular basis.Some will argue this points in the direction of a lab accident theory, as who knows what kind of material comes out of the sewer lines of the Wuhan Institute of Virology or Wuhan Centers for Disease Control, and whether someone could have used waste material that was carrying SARS-CoV-2 to create their “gutter oil.” (That report is from 2013; China’s food safety problems have no better symbol than the illegal and utterly disgusting problem of gutter oil. Cooking oil is used heavily in Chinese food, so some street vendors and hole-in-the-wall restaurants buy cheap, black market oil that’s been recycled from garbage. You read that correctly. Enterprising men and women will go through dumpsters, trash bins, gutters and even sewers, scooping out liquid or solid refuse that contains used oil or animal parts. Then they process that into cooking oil, which they sell at below-market rates to food vendors who use it to cook food that can make you extremely sick.Today’s “I can’t believe that” report about wet markets in China, called to my attention by Morning Jolt reader David, is that apparently quite a few vendors use cooking oil that has been pulled from waste from <strong>Just When You Thought You Had Heard Everything about China’s Wet Markets . . .</strong>There is no Morning Jolt this Friday.

In order for the fund to lend more, German and the other euro members would likely have to increase the fund’s capital base, triggering another contentious debate in Berlin. But waiting to do so until Italy and Spain’s economic position deteriorates further is bound to increase the cost of rescuing them and could even make doing so impossible. In contrast to Greece, one of Europe’s smallest economies, Italy and Spain are the bloc’s third- and fourth-largest respectively.Italy alone will need financial assistance in the scale of €200-€250 billion to stay afloat, said Gabriel Felbermayr, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. But the ESM loans under discussion in Brussels would only total €200 billion for all eurozone countries combined.[T]he sums currently under discussion are unlikely to be anywhere near enough.But:The measures currently under discussion in Brussels for the entire eurozone — a combination of credit lines from the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund, unemployment assistance and reduced-rate corporate loans — equal less than half of what Germany has prescribed for itself. The reason the deal on the table is so attractive to Berlin is simple: it costs Germany relatively little (if no one defaults). The ESM, for example, could rely on its existing lending capacity to extend whatever credit countries apply for.So how about the ESM?“With some justification” is an understatement.There’s brGermany appears to be content to shelter behind the Dutch for now, but (in another article largely unsympathetic to the Eurozone’s ‘frugal four’ — Germany, The Netherlands, Finland and Austria) Matthew Karnitschnig and Hans von der Burchard, writing in Alternatively, leaving Italy to fend for herself could cause widespread Italian defaults, triggering defaults by those who have lent to the Italian government and banks. The ECB could keep buying the Italian government’s debt to prevent a default. But it is not the task of a central bank to deal with insolvencies. Moreover, such an effort would be technically and politically fraught for the ECB, which is not a normal central bank. The ECB is the central banker to a confederation of nations, each of which maintains fiscal sovereignty. If Italy is pushed to the brink, the ECB will struggle to help. The current ECB bond-buying limit of a trillion euros is designated to purchase the bonds of all member states. Italian government debt is over two trillion euros, which will increase further if the government is forced to financially prop up the country’s banks. If Italy is bailed out, other member states on the ECB’s Governing Council will face buying so much Italian debt that the ECB would own Italy. If then, the Italian government is unable to service its debt to the ECB, other member states will face the charged task of using their tax revenues to replenish the ECB’s capital.Ashoka Mody The uncomfortable reality is that this wasBut the fact is that the country has not seen the benefits of the euro.

This makes our elites relatively easy for a bloody-minded Chinese Communist Party to manipulate. I’d rather our institutions not volunteer for these struggle sessions.If I might speculate for a minute, I think we’re going to see a great number of these apologies. Initially, no one thought calling it the “Chinese coronavirus” or the “Wuhan flu” was offensive or bigoted. Names like this were used in China or in Asian polities like Hong Kong and Taiwan where ethnic Han Chinese predominate. But the Chinese mainland government and its co-conspirator, the World Health Organization, have pushed this narrative about “stigma” being worse than the disease itself relentlessly. I’ve mostly given up calling it the Wuhan virus, only because calling it COVID-19 or just “COVID” is what’s common among friends who are in the medical profession. But I think apologies are inappropriate. So long as honest historians of this era exist, the virus will always be “associated” with Wuhan and China.Of course one expects that there will be fewer international students at Western universities, but the primary cause of this will be fear of the disease itself and the travel bans that impose uncertainty on the endeavor of international study.

The accidental-release scenario would require one of the several hundred bats being used for research on coronaviruses in either the Wuhan Institute of Virology or Wuhan Center for Disease Control to have developed SARS-CoV-2 and for it to have accidentally infected someone at the lab through blood, urine, or feces, and then for that lab employee to have unknowingly passed it to others. Alternatively, some biological material containing the virus could have been improperly disposed of, leading to an accidental infection of someone outside the lab.Bats are sold in markets and supplied directly to restaurants throughout China and southeast Asia, but no direct evidence of their sale in Wuhan’s wet market has come to light. Also, Rather, it is probable that somewhere much closer to Wuhan, there is another colony of bats carrying the same kind of virus. Unless other evidence emerges, it thus looks like a horrible coincidence that China’s Institute of Virology, a high-security laboratory where human cells were being experimentally infected with bat viruses, happens to be in Wuhan, the origin of today’s pandemic.Significantly, the same analysis shows that the most recent common ancestor of the human virus and the RaTG13 virus lived at least 40 years ago. So it is unlikely that the cave in Yunnan (a thousand miles from Wuhan) is where the first infection happened or that the culprit bat was taken from that cave to Wuhan to be eaten or experimented on.The role of pangolins in the spread of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, remains unclear. A closer look at more of the Sars-CoV-2 genome, published last week by Maciej Boni at Penn State University and David Robertson at Glasgow University, together with Chinese and European colleagues, finds that RaTG13 is the name, rank and serial number of an individual horseshoe bat of the species But scientists are always learning more.

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>The question of when government officials will reopen the country they have shut down for coronavirus presses, as does the question of whether some less-draconian measures than the ones in place could suffice. Hopefully, officials will have a better answer than, “Well, our models say …”To compare, the CDC estimates that Because of the way the media report on skepticism about models and a desire to get reliable facts (which used to be the media’s job), I pause to stress that I am not belittling the threat of the virus, particularly to people who are especially vulnerable — the elderly and those with underlying health problems, especially respiratory problems. The question is one of balance. American lives are being shattered by the restrictions that have been put in place. The decision to do that was based on models. Those models have no credibility. They now tell us that about 61,000 may die of coronavirus this year — although, if the last few days are any indication, that number could be revised downward soon, perhaps substantially.On April 8, IHME reduced the total number of hospital beds it had predicted would be needed nationally by a remarkable 166,890 — down to 95,202 from the 262,092 it had predicted less than a week earlier (i.e., it was nearly two-thirds off). The ICU projection over that same week was cut in half: to 19,816 on April 8, down from 39,727 on April 2. The projected need for ventilators also fell by nearly half, to 16,845 from 31,782.As I detailed in the last post, the revised April 5 model was grossly wrong even in predicting conditions that would obtain on April 5 itself. It had predicted that on that day, New York, the epicenter of the crisis, would need about 24,000 hospital beds, including 6,000 ICU beds. In fact, the model was off by a third — New York had 16,479 hospitalized COVID patients, 4,376 that were in ICU.And mind you, when we observe that the government is The model on which the government is relying is simply unreliable. It is not that social distancing has changed the equation; it is that the equation’s fundamental assumptions are so dead wrong, they cannot remain reasonably stable for just 72 hours.My use of the term “off” is intentional. There is no shortage of government spin, regurgitated by media commentators, assuring us that the drastic reductions in the projections over just a few days powerfully illustrate how well social distancing and the substantial shuttering of the economy is working. Nonsense. As On April 8, the projected cumulative deaths were slashed to 60,145 (with the upper range again cut, to about 126,000). That is, in less than a week, the model proved to be off by more than 33 percent.As I noted in my last post on this subject, by April 5, the projection of likely deaths had plunged 12 percent in just three days, 93,531 to 81,766. Understand, this projection is drawn from a range; on April 2, IHME was telling us cumulative COVID-19 deaths could reach as high as approximately 178,000. The upper range was also reduced on April 5 to about 136,000.In a space of just six days starting April 2, two revisions (on April 5 and 8) have utterly discredited the model produced by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. To describe as stunning the collapse of a key model the government has used to alarm the nation about the catastrophic threat of the coronavirus would not do this development justice.National ReviewFollow Us",0,COVID-19 Projection Models Are Proving to Be Unreliable

   And that’s how it should be in a free society.And this raises another complication for those who think the government can just “re-open” the economy with the flick of a switch. Trump and all of the governors could lift the stay-at-home orders and federal advisories tomorrow. That wouldn’t necessarily fill the restaurants, airplanes, or stadiums. People would still need to be convinced it’s safe. Such persuasion comes via clear, believable information, not orders from on high.Information doesn’t just come from governments. The death tolls in Italy and New York probably did more to change behavior on the ground than all of Trump’s press conferences or Dr. Anthony Fauci’s TV appearances.People change their behavior when they are given clear information about risks. Various countries have flattened the curve of COVID-19 cases in different ways, Stone explained on my podcast, My American Enterprise Institute colleague Lyman Stone, an economist based in Hong Kong, makes the case that the essential variable in “flattening the curve” isn’t central planning but behavior change. Many businesses closed down well before they were ordered to. Millions of people practiced social distancing and refused to get on planes not because they were commanded to, but because they were convinced this was a wise course of action for themselves and their loved ones.Still, there’s an interesting assumption common to both sides of the debate: that the government is responsible for all of this. Both defenders and the critics start from the premise that government diktats are the only variable here.It’s almost surely the case that the models were wrong to one degree or another for the simple reason that any model is only as good as the data fed into it. With imperfect information — partly thanks to the outrageous dishonesty of the Chinese government and the grave missteps of the World Health Organization — it was inevitable that the models would never be more than best guesses. We’re far from out of the woods, but the fact that “only” some 60,000 Americans may die instead of 240,000 seems like something to celebrate, not an excuse to scapegoat officials who scrambled to save lives.Of course, predicting the spread of a new virus across the globe isn’t remotely like calculating the correct change for a bag of potato chips. We’re talking about the interdependent behavior of hundreds of millions of Americans, and billions globally, across institutions, communities, and borders.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>The first error is assuming that the scientists at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Imperial College London, National Institutes of Health, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were acting in bad faith. Just because a cashier makes a math error when giving you change doesn’t mean he’s trying to steal from you. And just because these models weren’t perfectly oracular doesn’t mean anyone was lying.I think these people are mostly on the wrong side of the argument, but I don’t begrudge anyone who’s desperate to get the country working again. The economic toll of this pandemic is staggering and will be felt for a generation or more, even if we get the much-craved “V”-shaped recovery when the all-clear is sounded.What makes the debate uglier than it needs to be is that many of the people denouncing the initial projections want to make the case that our response was deliberately misguided from the beginning — so much media hype, partisan point scoring, and ideologically motivated crisis exploitation — and that we never should have shuttered the economy.The serious debate centers on whether the initial models were always exaggerated, or whether the response to them is driving down fatalities more effectively than epidemiologists predicted. For what it’s worth, my opinion is “both.”A few conspiracy theorists — so-called “coronavirus truthers” — see more sinister motives at play. But, as is always the case, these cranks and grifters are best ignored, so I won’t shine a light on them here.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

No charge.Each of these decisions deserves scrutiny, but so too do the decisions of government officials that may have made in-person voting more dangerous than it had to be.On April 6, Evers issued an executive order to move the election to June, after having called such a unilateral action illegal a few days earlier. The state’s supreme court enjoined Evers’s order after the legislature’s leaders challenged it.Governor Evers did not come out in favor of postponing the election until April 3, and when Wisconsin’s Republican legislature rejected his proposal on April 4 it took no actions to ensure local officials had the resources necessary to keep their polling places open.Weeks passed between the time the national emergency was declared on March 13 and the April 7 elections, but some local officials weren’t aware that the National Guard would be of assistance until they learned about it in the news on April 1.While municipalities are in charge of running polling places in Wisconsin, state officials bear responsibility for how the election played out.Green Bay mayor Eric Geinrich responded to criticism in a “I volunteered, and I asked people in my district and got at least a dozen people” to volunteer as poll workers, Green Bay alderman Chris Wery tells Milwaukee wasn’t the only city where a reduction in the number polling places caused long lines and waits. The city of Green Bay went from its typical 31 polling places to just two, and some voters had to wait hours to cast ballots. One Green Bay alderman, who contends city officials made in-person voting much worse than it had to be, is calling for an   
     
   The second reason, he says, is that health and safety precautions required more workers at each site who were cleaning the polling booths after each voter cast a ballot, distributing masks and gloves, “enforcing social distancing or monitoring activities outside of the polling place, in addition to the voting room. Every aspect of administering the election was much more labor intensive than a normal election. So 100 people [working] at a voting site for this election was probably like 10 people at a voting site for a normal election.” Albrecht says that the five sites selected for voting provided a lot of square footage inside to ensure social distancing. Health and safety regulations required polling centers to have no more than 50 to 100 people inside the premises at a time, he says.“Well, for two reasons,” Albrecht replies. “When I had to make the judgment call on how many centers we could operate, I had to base it on the information I had at that moment in time. At that point, we were probably down to about 250 election workers. And that number was continuing to dwindle. So, I had to make a commitment for a number that I knew we could operate without compromising the integrity of the election but also that we could do safely.”If the city had nearly 20 percent of its usual number of poll workers, plus the National Guard, why did it only open 3 percent of its usual number of polling places?So, during a normal presidential primary, the city has about 11 poll workers for each polling place. On Tuesday, that number was closer to 80 poll workers per center, plus 30 National Guardsmen.According to Albrecht, the city of Milwaukee had fewer than 400 election workers on April 7, compared to the typical “2,000 election workers to staff the 180 sites” for a presidential primary.Albrecht says that as he was trying to finalize the number of polling places last week, “the number of poll workers that we were going to have was changing on a daily basis. It was literally like trying to hold water in our hands.”Just how many more polling places could Milwaukee have opened up if officials had known about the National Guard earlier? “I’m just not going to speculate. I’m not going to dwell on this issue,” Albrecht tells “Had we had that information [about the National Guard] sooner, I absolutely think it could have influenced the number of voting centers,” Albrecht <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/01/tony-evers-use-national-guard-members-work-polls-amid-massive-shortage-workers/5102869002/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">On April 1</a>Democratic governor Tony Evers Twenty-five days elapsed between the declaration of a national emergency regarding the coronavirus on March 13 and the elections scheduled in Wisconsin on April 7. And during that time, there was a failure of planning and a breakdown in communication between state and local officials to ensure enough polling places stayed open.
There are signs that poor planning and coordination among government officials made in-person voting in Wisconsin more dangerous than it had to be.As it happened, the reduced number of polling places meant that thousands of voters formed long lines at each of the five polling centers. Voters did their best to maintain physical separation, but some of them waited two hours to cast ballots.If city and state officials had found a way to keep Milwaukee’s 180 polling places open, only a little more than 100 voters on average would have passed through each polling place throughout the course of the day (a total of 18,803 voters cast ballots in person in Milwaukee).While there weren’t lines of voters in the state capital of <span class=""small_caps""><span class=""drop"">P</span>resumptive</span>

Former Vermont Democratic Governor Howard Dean is a medical doctor. Former Michigan Republican Governor John Engler, after he left office, went on to run the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable. The ideal candidate, my former boss, Bush 43 Energy Secretary Sam Bodman, is unavailable; he passed away too soon. Yet there are plenty of other strong candidates who have served in government and have backgrounds in the hard sciences, health care, finance or engineering.Such a commission, if it were bipartisan and composed of heavyweights from the fields of medicine, government and industry, could do a lot to help us understand how and why things got as far as they did. A panel led by the likes of former Vice President Dick Cheney or former House Speaker Newt Gingrich for the Republicans and former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta or former Governor Jerry Brown for the Democrats would immediately command the public’s respect. They’ve demonstrated at one time or another that they’re not afraid to ask hard questions and follow the truth where it leads. More important, they would not shy away from making tough recommendations regarding future economic, health and national security needs—even if they might upset the institutions and political allies that once gave them their considerable power.There should be a commission, ideally appointed by the president, that looks at all aspects of the COVID-19 crisis with special concentration on the way federal and state governments failed the citizens who put them in office.6. At “[W]hat people are trying to do is flatten the curve. I don’t really know why. But, what happens is if you flatten the curve, you also prolong, to widen it, and it takes more time. And I don’t see a good reason for a respiratory disease to stay in the population longer than necessary,” he said.Knut Wittkowski, previously the longtime head of the Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design at the Rockefeller University in New York City, said in an A veteran scholar of epidemiology has warned that the ongoing lockdowns throughout the United States and the rest of the world are almost certainly just prolonging the coronavirus outbreak rather than doing anything to truly mitigate it.5. At The EU’s Court of Justice also stipulated in its ruling that “those Member States can rely neither on their responsibilities concerning the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security, nor on the alleged malfunctioning of the relocation mechanism to avoid implementing that mechanism.” Let’s reiterate what this court ruling states, as outrageous as it is, in order to fully comprehend its tyrannous nature. The member states of the European Union have no legal right to safeguard their own internal security, nor even maintain law and order, if the EU orders them to do something that endangers both. This is nothing less than imperialism of the most egregious sort, riding roughshod over any semblance of subsidiarity, which the EU claims that its members possess.Seeing through the EU’s jargon, these three countries believed that the vast majority of the migrants were not “applicants for international protection” but were merely economic migrants from mostly Muslim countries seeking illegal entry into Europe, amongst whom might be many potential terrorists. “The most important goal of government policy is to ensure security for our citizens,” said Polish government spokesman Piotr Müller. “Our actions were dictated by the interests of Polish citizens and defending [the country] against uncontrolled migration.”“By refusing to comply with the temporary mechanism for the relocation of applicants for international protection,” the Court of Justice said in its ruling, “Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have failed to fulfil their obligations under European Union law.”On April 2, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the EU’s “supreme court,” ruled that its member nations have no right to control their borders, unless they have first gained the EU’s permission to do so. This, at least was the essence of the ruling, which appertained to the migrant crisis of 2015 and which reprimanded those countries that had refused to open their doors to the mandatory quota of migrants that the EU had sought to impose on them.4. More EU Crackup: At The central reality of American politics today is the gulf between, on one hand, the nation’s elites and their primary constituency groups (minorities, academics, government employees, and well-off urban/suburbanites) and, on the other hand, that 55 percent of the electorate characterized by Walter Russell Mead as being motivated primarily by an abiding hostility to what Mead calls “the self-proclaimed expert class.”This knot of political hostility stems from the perceived follies perpetrated over the last half-century or so by the meritocratic elite–endless Middle East wars without victory or even much of a point; immigration laxity to the point of serious assimilation challenges; the outsourcing of our industrial capacity to the point where other nations, particularly China, control the distribution of goods and products that are crucial to U.S. military preparedness and citizen safety and health; a student-debt crisis that thwarts upward mobility of the nation’s young; a spree of fiscal irresponsibility that saddles cities and states with irrepressible pension debt while leaving untended massive infrastructure imperatives; and financial disruption throughout Middle America stemming from the hollowing out of the country’s industrial base.This status quo is facing increasing hostility from vast numbers of ordinary Americans who feel that the elites and the big institutions they dominate have hijacked the American system for their own exploitation. In his In domestic terms, the status quo has been characterized by relatively porous borders, the financialization of the U.S. economy, deindustrialization, anti-nationalism, a liberal political hegemony on social and cultural issues enforced through political correctness, and an oligarchy of bigness–Wall Street’s big finance, Washington’s big government, big corporations throughout the country, big labor representing increasingly well-off public employees, and self-aggrandizing state and local governments.3. More from Even if the European Union continues to function in a political and formal sense, emotionally, for the majority of the citizens of Mediterranean countries it no longer exists. If tomorrow morning a consultative referendum were held in Italy with an online vote, 80 percent of Italians would likely favor an exit. Not only conservative and center right parties have opposed the current European Union, but for the first time, many liberal and left-wing citizens have also taken sides against the EU as they observe their response to the pandemic and the perceived indifference to Italy’s fate.The current crisis cannot be compared to that of 2008. In 2008, Europe faced a financial crisis with economic and social consequences. Today, we face a public health emergency, which means that the emotional aspect also plays an important role. How do you tell an entrepreneur from Lombardy, one of the wealthiest regions in Europe with a GDP higher than many regions of Germany, that the European Union allocated ten days to discuss and find a solution—in the middle of a pandemic, when lives are at stake? How do you explain that to someone who has worked for a lifetime, paid taxes, provided jobs to many people and who has probably lost his father, a friend, or an employee to the coronavirus in a matter of days?The fear of the center-right parties, in particular Giorgia Meloni’s Fratelli d’Italia and Matteo Salvini’s Lega, is that the government of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will end up accepting the ESM, which will probably be packaged and presented differently, but in substance will remain the same.Why don’t the countries of southern Europe (and Ireland, which has joined them) want to accept the use of the resources of the ESM? Journalist Nicola Porro, one of the most well-known voices in the world of the Italian center right-wing, put it this way in one of his popular videos: accepting the ESM would risk putting Italy into receivership administered by a reborn “troika” consisting of the ECB, the EU and the IMF—just as happened in Greece in 2008. The risk of accepting those resources today could prove fatal since the conditions of the loan would most likely change after the emergency ends.2. I-rrivederci?

Jim Geraghty traces the viral origins. <strong>Bats in the Wuhan Belfry</strong>You might dig the Hillsdale prof’s distance-lecturing, like this Friday’s lecture on Ideology and Communism. <strong>Crash Brad Birzer’s Class</strong>For over a year, even before coronavirus, protests grew. Millions of Cubans boycotted a regime-sponsored referendum, despite “voting” being enforced by the Communist Party’s mass organizations. The LGBT community carried out a large protest, and bloggers publicly gathered in Havana to demand an end to censorship. Protesting crowds forced the dreaded “Black Beret” repressive forces to retreat in Santiago de Cuba, while hundreds of protesters in the central city of Santa Clara marched in protest against the offices of the Communist Party, after a large informal public market in Santa Clara was closed down as part of the regime’s ruthless use of food rations to control the population. A protracted, year-long strike by independent transport workers broke the myth that concerted citizen resistance efforts can be stopped by the regime’s security forces.Ironically, in Cuba, a country pauperized by a Marxist model for the past 61 years, there is a growing public cry demanding change. The dissent movement in Cuba is organic, emerging from diverse nuclei in the population. It often arises as a leaderless resistance, a natural response to the pervasive police-state repression of individual rights.Venezuela and Nicaragua remain under the grip of despotic regimes. Bolivia, which successfully prevented Evo Morales from consolidating a tyrannical socialist regime, may now face a relapse because of bickering among pro-democracy factions. In Chile, for 30 years a shining light of democracy and free-market economics in the region, a violent anarcho-Communist insurrection has hijacked what was a citizen drive for social reforms. Rapid modernization processes, such as Chile’s, often include segments of a population that lag behind or lack instruments of inclusion. The sane way to heal this is through the expansion of the democratic compact, and the generation of new opportunities through universal education and more economic freedom.  But reform is not the goal of the anarcho-Communists in Chile. It is destruction of democracy itself, in order to build a socialist revolution. The violence in the streets of Santiago and other cities is a premeditated effort by collectivists to destroy the free-market economic model because it was based on individual freedom, and because the Marxists could not abide a capitalist model that had consistently reduced extreme poverty. The radical agenda of the riots’ leaders, who publicly call for Chile to follow the path of Cuba and Venezuela, is a threat to the freedom, democracy, and pluralistic economy that country has developed.Latin American democracies concurrently face the resurgence of a familiar, yet lethal, virus. Across the region, the ideological disease of collectivist totalitarianism still infects the unprepared or those looking for simple solutions. With the regional epicenter of the ideological contagion in Cuba, the influence of totalitarian tendencies is felt throughout the region.18. In South America, it’s not just the Wuhan-brewed pathogen that’s causing societal havoc. Per Otto Reich and Orlando Gutierrez Boronat, socialism and communism continue to plague the continent. Turner’s entire approach is misguided. To begin with, he obscures the 1619 Project’s entirely unprofessional abuse of historical facts to create a denigratory Turner, positioning himself as the neutral and expert arbiter, frames the 1619 Project and its critics as equally mistaken — the one unduly obsessed with the 1619 arrival of blacks in Virginia as the foundation of an America built on slavery, and the other unduly obsessed with the 1620 arrival of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, as the foundation of an America built on liberty. Neither view, says Turner, is correct. Nor are views of America as built on liberty in 1776 or 1787. All the supposed foundations of liberty are compromised by racism or elitism: The proper way to understand America is to look at the endless details of Americans’ flaws, and not their sweeping aspirations.Turner, a Of course the Pilgrim landing at Plymouth Rock in 1620 explains American history. Of course the 1619 Project’s shoddy exercise in vituperation is meant to delegitimize America. John G. Turner’s 17. David Randall charges John Turner’s recent NRO piece “Low-end” refers traditionally to frigates and corvettes that are smaller than destroyers or cruisers, have smaller crews, lower sensor-system and weapons complexity, and lower costs so that navies can purchase them in larger numbers to perform day-to-day presence, escort, surveillance, and interdiction missions. British admiral Horatio Nelson referred to frigates as the “eyes” of the fleet, and historically corvettes were designed to be small enough to operate in an enemy’s close-to-shore littoral regions. By this standard the U.S. Navy’s littoral-combat ships would normally be considered corvettes. Although the Navy has purchased 30 of them, these ships have not been as effective as the Navy had hoped, with nearly all of them presenting difficulties with their combat systems. To fulfill the counter-drug mission described by the president and his team, what the Navy and the Southern Command really need is frigates, and fortunately, they should be coming soon.So why are high-end ships being used so consistently to do low-end missions, of which counter-drug operations in the Caribbean and Pacific are yet another example? The answer is that the Navy doesn’t have the low-end ships to match with those missions.Nevertheless, the use of destroyers for this particular purpose raises concerns. At $1.8 billion each, Arleigh Burke–class destroyers are among the world’s most expensive and technologically advanced weapons systems. Many of these ships are engaged in ballistic-missile defense and other high-end missions around the world. Although there is great demand for the vessels to support complex engagements, they are engaged all too often in low-end missions such as Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea or naval-presence patrols in any of the numerous maritime regions of the globe where U.S. regional combatant commanders have identified important U.S. national interests and have asked for ships to support them. These missions have the appearance of overkill, as a highly technically specialized warship is used for purposes that rank low in terms of technical requirements, such as providing naval presence in places like the Gulf of Guinea or taking part in counter-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Oman.Counter-drug operations are clearly a critical mission for the United States, given the tragedy of addictions and deaths associated with illicit-drug use and their impact on American families and the economy. The argument can even be made that the use of U.S. military assets to carry out that mission is appropriate: Stability is of strategic importance, as is maintaining laws and norms in the Western hemisphere. Furthermore, increasing levels of Chinese activity and investment in the Western hemisphere make it ever-more important for the U.S. military to have a highly visible presence in the region. We cannot be strong abroad if we are weakened at home; there must be no doubt that the Western hemisphere is our home, and that we are in charge.16. Jerry Hendrix states the naval need for frigates in the battle against Venezuelan thug Maduro’s drug incursions. So it can happen and it has happened: inflation within a collapsed economy. Stimuluses cannot increase real output in an economy where such an increase is forbidden by law. But the stimuluses of Spring 2020 can provide a boost to the prices of goods and services. Such stimuluses can also slip over into liquid-asset markets and slow the inevitable slide in global stock markets, at least for a while.It is often argued that this kind of inflationary takeoff simply cannot happen in a collapsed economy. What Germany’s Weimar Republic went through in 1923 suggests otherwise. Several Latin-American countries pursued a similar strategy in the mid-20th century with results that were qualitatively similar to the experience of Germany in 1923.Increasing the money supply by dramatic amounts in an economy where output is constrained by law is not likely to be benign and non-inflationary. Again, where does this money go, if not to higher prices for a declining amount of goods and services.It is worth a pause to reflect on the views of economists on this situation. Almost all modern academic monetary models suggest that inflation will not respond to changes in the growth rate of the money supply. Think about that one for a minute. If expanding the money supply has only negligible effects on inflation, then what possible downside could there be from expanding the money supply to finance ordinary, routine government expenditures? Why do countries bother with tax collections at all? Simply issue sovereign debt, have your central bank buy it, and there will be no downside since no inflation will result.15. Ed Burton assesses the stimulus packages. There are reasons for concern. Released without much fanfare on March 20 as America was going into hibernation, To date, Netflix has moved heaven and earth — and spent enough money to buy both — to keep us subscribing, but its brand has become a synonym for lackluster-to-pretty-good entertainment. 14. Even More Kyle: He ruminates on the The title is not ironic: He is sincerely trying to tell something like the truth about what it’s like to be the person he is, a severely flawed man of the early 21st century. Louis C.K. has always invited us to consider the comedy payoff of rolling with our worst thoughts instead of cutting them off before they get disturbing. This means that being inappropriate is now, as it always has been, central to his act. There’s a joke about rape along these lines. It’s horrible, but it’s also very funny. It’s funny The new special, “I’m not a good person,” Louis C.K. says near the top of his new one-hour special. We heard. Do I want Louis C.K. making s’mores with my kid’s Girl Scout troop? No, I do not. And if I were a woman, I might be reluctant to be alone with him. (On the other hand, I might just remember that I have the right to walk away if anything weird starts to happen.) Fortunately, I don’t have to worry about these things, and neither do you. As comedy consumers, none of us has to be in the room with Louis C.K. We can benefit from his brilliance without having to deal with his perversion.13. More Kyle: He watches the new special and once again makes the case for controversial comedian Louis C. K. The causal variable here is almost certainly not race. Although the virus is not perfectly understood, it is much more likely that factors such as underlying health conditions drive death rates, not race. There’s also the reality that a virus spreads person to person. It will take detailed analysis by epidemiologists and others to understand how the virus spread from neighborhood to neighborhood. In the south Georgia town of Albany, for instance, we know that the outbreak emerged A young, healthy African-American with great health-care coverage who telecommutes every day and has groceries delivered to his door is not automatically at higher risk of contracting the virus or succumbing to it than an elderly white man who rides the subway to work every morning to work at an essential business where he interacts with hundreds of people a day.We should remember that when we think about the pandemic.We’ve seen this story before, with crime. In many parts of America, African Americans are overrepresented versus their share of the population in crime statistics. For years, racist demagogues used this fact to claim that criminality was a feature of African Americans. But eventually, social scientists discarded simple univariate analysis and learned to correlate factors such as social inequality, the prevalence of the drug trade, and low-quality policing as the true culprits that drive crime — among blacks, whites, and virtually every other group. The news media, wisely, moved away from focusing on the race of criminal perpetrators, coming to understand that race is merely a social fiction, not useful for correlating to complex problems that impact people of all backgrounds.12. There’s nothing — including a viral pathogen and pandemic — that the Left can’t and won’t racialize. Zaid Jilani slaps the effort. What’s most unclear from Biden’s proposal is its purpose. He does not spell out in precise language how the various interest groups in the “community” in question have yet to attain the “equality” his plan is ostensibly meant to help them achieve. The only thing that is clear is that “tolerance,” in the traditional understanding of that word, is not the plan’s principal aim.A third prong of the Biden proposal suggests enacting measures to change “underlying attitudes” about “LGBTQ+ issues” through “public information campaigns.” What these “campaigns” will look like in practice needs explicit definition. Will the federal government spend taxpayer dollars on a “public information campaign” to remind the masses that not all men have penises? This is left to our imagination. And it is not hard to imagine a “public information campaign” directed at insubordinate churches that cling (bitterly?) to their Bibles and maintain fealty to their bimillennial faith’s dogma on human sexuality. The latter is not much of a stretch when one considers what Joe Biden (or the handlers who drafted his proposal) thinks of the legitimacy of those moral commitments. Biden also pledges to “reverse” religious-freedom carveouts pursued by the Trump administration to ensure “that no one is turned away from a business or refused service by a government official just because of who they are or who they love.” Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop and others who actually believe their faiths to be true and not mere lifestyle accoutrements to be brandished when fashionable figure to be excluded from the regime of “equality” pursued by the Biden administration.Biden also promises to “decriminalize HIV exposure and transmission,” because such laws — all together, now! — “perpetuate discrimination and stigma towards people with HIV/AIDS.” Perhaps there is a reasonable case to be made that some anti-exposure laws are unduly punitive (some states punish HIV-positive persons who spit in public, for instance, yet spitting poses 11. Down in the basement, Joe Biden is cranking up a gender / sex platform. John Hirschauer looks in its political Xs and Ys. Or we can have bipartisan commissions decide how best to return key industries to the U.S., prepare for the next epidemic, and pay down the enormous debt we have incurred to defeat COVID-19.We can ridicule the idea of Americans again making their own things and call it protectionism or economic chauvinism. We can conduct endless congressional inquiries about who said what and when about the virus, and perhaps reopen impeachment.We can scapegoat and play the blame game. We can talk not of an America in crisis, but of the virus’ effects on particular groups. We can decide that it is mean or even racist and xenophobic to hold the Chinese government accountable for its swath of viral destruction — and so we will not.Our other choice is to keep bickering and suffering amnesia, remaining as vulnerable as we were in the past.One, we can wake up as we did on December 8, 1941, to ensure that Americans control their own fundamentals of life — food, fuel, medicine, and strategic industries — without dependency on illiberal regimes. The military can refocus our defenses against nuclear missiles, cyberwarfare, and biological weapons. On the home front, diversity is fine, but in a national crisis as serious as this one, the unity that arises from confidence in shared American citizenship saves lives.Post-virus America can awake from this epidemic and economic shutdown in one of two different ways.10. Will America emerge from the crisis as a crybaby state? Victor Davis Hanson has some thoughts. If these dictates had been allowed to stand, they would have created insanely destructive precedents, taking elections out of the hands of local legislatures. If we discard legal norms every time there’s a crisis, we no longer have a nation of laws, but a country at the mercy of arbitrary decrees, emotional appeals, and pliable courts.By forcing Wisconsin to keep voting alive for nearly a week after they were meant to close, the district court realized that late voters would have information regarding election results, so it tried to shut down legally mandated reporting requirements. Sandefur tells me thatAnd as Timothy Sandefur, Vice President for Litigation at the Goldwater Institute, points outThis week, the Supreme Court ruled that a federal court was not empowered to overwrite Wisconsin’s election laws and force the state to accept ballots without any postmark deadline nearly a week after the election. Likewise, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that Governor Tony Evers did not have the authority to I’m sorry, but you have no constitutional “right” to vote by mail. You have no constitutional “right” to vote 9. More Harsanyi: David attacks Democrats’ unconstitutional efforts to federalize elections. When Trump first mentioned hydroxychloroquine, reporters scoured the world to find overdose cases so they could claim the president had blood on his hands. When that effort came up short, they clutched pearls after some nitwit couple thought it wise to ingest fish-tank cleaning liquid. Now this.Nor should it escape your attention that the All of this is just fodder for the screeching partisan minions, nothing else. If there were a healthy, functioning fourth column, a piece like this would never run.  Can you imagine any major publication running a piece linking Barack Obama’s praise of GM’s heavily subsidized electric-car manufacturing to a thousand bucks in a mutual fund?Working from this predetermined position, reporters are sure that Trump, who they think became president to fill the rooms in his D.C. hotel, isn’t merely peddling hope for hope’s sake alone.The Left simply can’t accept that a Republican acts in good faith. If they’re not hiding some devious self-serving motivation, they’re under the thumb of a foreign power or a shadowy industry. If it’s not Big Oil leading George Bush into Iraq, it’s Mitt Romney trying to hand the country to his buddies at Bain Capital.8. David Harsanyi belittles the Left’s jihad against hydroxychloroquine. They have failed this principle. A host of popular media figures has been demanding tighter restrictions, with shock jock extraordinaire Piers Morgan — who once polluted American screens on his ghastly CNN show — being particularly vociferous. He has regularly called people relaxing in London parks “traitors” and urged severe punishment.For reasons of succinctness, I won’t list them all. But my favorite is the fifth, which commands policemen to “seek and preserve public favour, not by pandering to public opinion; but by constantly demonstrating absolutely impartial service to law.”This is intolerable. British police are governed by the beautiful and freedom-preserving philosophy of policing by consent, which refers to the Peelian principles. Named after Prime Minister Robert Peel — the “father of modern policing” — the nine principles were issued to every officer from 1829 onward.Police have also taken to cycling around London parks and telling off citizens for enjoying “non-essential exercise,” such as a brief stroll and rest in the sun in a park away from their cramped and miserable flats. Just last week, a woman was fined £660 for being at Newcastle Central train station and “failing to provide identity or reasons for travel to police.” She soon found out that this crime doesn’t exist.How quickly we have lapsed into statism.Derbyshire police have been using drones to keep the eye of the state on people wandering to beauty spots — an action I remember mocking the CCP for doing just a few months ago. One clip, which they gleefully shared on Twitter, showed two people pausing for an “unnecessary selfie” while taking a “non-essential walk.”7. Big Brother loves a crisis. Charlie Peters reports how in the U.K., he’s empowered the neighborhood snitchers and henchmen. There is even a moral corruption that spreads from China to American companies and consumers. As part of its attempt at cultural genocide of Muslims around Kashgar in the west of China, a program was introduced to spread Muslim workers around China on rotation. These half-imprisoned victims of persecution The China problem in international organizations goes beyond internationalist institutions in which the Chinese state is a member; it goes to Chinese-backed enterprises that act as arms of the Chinese state. Using the vast resources of the state, telecom company Huawei has been able to clear the field of other competitors and muscle up against Ericsson for dominance of the European mobile-phone market. 6. If there is a global virus, says Michael Brendan Dougherty, it’s the Chinese Communist Party. And then Gove was fully vindicated. He turned out to be 100 percent correct.The mocking changed its tone when Brexit carried the day on June 23, 2016, with more Britons voting for it than had ever voted for anything in the thousand-year history of the country. Now Gove’s remark became the source of the ashen taste in the mouths of Remoaner metropolitan elites bewailing how provincial troglodytes, geriatrics, and Little Englanders had dashed their rationalist, internationalist dreams.In the U.K., the debate on experts hit a new level on the third of June, 2016, when Conservative cabinet minister and leading Brexit campaigner Michael Gove said, “I think the people of this country have had enough of experts.” This instantly became the defining absurdity of the Brexit referendum, and was pilloried and mocked nonstop. Ho ho, said the pundits, when Gove goes in for gall-bladder surgery, There has been a lot of talk since, oh, approximately November 8, 2016, about the relative use and reliability of experts, elites — our betters. We’re told that we need experts more than ever. One guy 5. The experts lied about masks. Kyle Smith, with real expertise, unmasks the Expertocracy. The only mention of Dr. Li Wenliang in the Chinese government’s timeline is on March 19, marking the Wuhan Public Security Bureau’s decision to revoke the previous reprimand letter and apologize to Li’s family over the mistake. Someone who read this timeline as their only source of information on the virus would have no idea who this doctor was or why the security bureau reprimanded him or subsequently apologized.I guess that timeline depends on how the Chinese government defines “late,” as the Chinese CDC itself previously said If you want a good laugh, compare 4. Whatever you do, writes Jim Geraghty, don’t trust the Chicoms’ Coronavirus timeline. But then, Sanders has never successfully navigated American political institutions to generate the kind of overwhelming enthusiasm he’d need to either pass genuinely transformative policies in the Senate or expand his voter base in elections. That suggests a In fact, the triumph of theory over reality may have doomed Sanders’s second run for the White House. The American working class has plenty of social moderates and conservatives, but his campaign elevated such figures as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Linda Sarsour, beloved by the Democratic Party’s activist class and controversial outside of it. He walked back his 2016-era border hawkishness and replaced it with activist-endorsed “abolish ICE” messaging. His campaign Both times Sanders ran for president, he lost black voters in Southern states by huge margins. Sanders did improve among Latinos from 2016 to 2020, allowing him to win California and put up a stronger fight in Texas this time around. But he couldn’t repeat his performance among the non-college-educated whites who’d clearly favored him over Hillary Clinton, especially in the Midwest. Reporters have noted that the Sanders campaign’s theory of the electorate was misguided: He avoided retail politics in the hope that his message would eventually carry the day — that the masses would be spontaneously drawn into the movement, in Lenin’s formulation. As Joe Simonson 3. Teddy Kupfer believes Bernie Sanders’ prexy runs will be less transformational than his supporters predict. This is the way this game works. Democratic administrations come into office and exploit the patronage (as they are entitled to do), sweeping out Republicans and getting their own people in place. The press reliably describes this as a much-needed injection of new progressive blood in the government’s veins. By contrast, when Republican presidents remove Democratic appointees, journalists wail about the invasion of “loyalists” and wistfully recall a noble bipartisan past, when new presidents retained the much-needed expertise of “non-partisan” (ahem) bureaucrats.He was not gone for long. As detailed above, President Obama recruited Fine for DoD in 2015. He has been in the IG’s office there ever since.In doing so, Clinton banked on his Republican successor’s inclination to extend a bipartisan olive branch after the historically contentious 2000 election. President Bush did not disappoint, keeping Fine rather than nominating his own DOJ IG. Predictably, Fine was a Upon taking office in 1993, President Clinton famously fired Republican appointees throughout the executive branch, including nearly every district U.S. attorney. By contrast, on his way out the door eight years later, he shrewdly installed Fine as the Justice Department’s inspector general.2. Andy McCarthy rebukes Democratic efforts to deny the president his right to hire and fire, and explains the partisan makeup of liberal martyr Glenn Fine. Beijing is a particularly nasty actor, but the coronavirus has demonstrated that even friendly nations will keep medical supplies from one other if it is in their self-interest to do so.Even if China weren’t a malign global competitor (it is), a remorseless dictatorship (it is), or a dishonest kleptocracy (it is), there would be risk inherent in having so many of our medications and their components coming from one country. We become vulnerable to any disruption of Chinese production, whether from disease, political unrest, or war.China is fully aware of its leverage. It notoriously threatened via its state-run media to cut off our supply of drugs (except fentanyl, of course) and plunge the U.S. into “the mighty sea of coronavirus.”China is a dominant force when it comes to generic drugs in particular, which account for the vast majority of medicines that American take. We rely on China for 90 percent of our antibiotics, and for drugs to treat everything from HIV/AIDS to cancer to depression.From 2010 to 2018, U.S. imports of pharmaceuticals from China increased 75 percent. China is the second largest exporter of drugs and biologics to the United States behind Canada, and our dependence is even greater, given that China is the source of the active ingredients of many drugs produced elsewhere. India, another major source of drugs for the U.S., gets about 75 percent of its active ingredients from China.The story of penicillin is the tale of U.S. dependence on China-sourced pharmaceuticals and active drug ingredients writ large.1. No way in hell Red China should be making our pharmaceuticals, says Rich Lowry. <strong>If You Were Looking for 18 Examples of NRO Publishing Brilliance, Look No Further: You Have Arrived</strong>We feel the same.

For one thing, businesses may need help restarting when this is over. For another, this pandemic has demonstrated that many countries will block exports of important medical supplies in an emergency, which is an obvious problem for countries that import such supplies. We are hardly protectionists, but this outbreak demands a full accounting of what crucial products we aren’t able to procure when we need them most, and a plan to either stockpile those products or ensure we can make them here.The other option is Hawley’s. He would have the federal government directly administer aid to businesses, including tax rebates that cover 80 percent of payroll (up to a cap), real-time payments to help businesses immediately, and a bonus for rehiring previously laid off workers. In theory, this sounds incredibly attractive. In practice, Congress first needs to make sure a program like this is administratively feasible; if there are serious obstacles, it may be unwise to start a new approach from scratch just as the old approach hits its stride. Lawmakers and staff need to reach out to the relevant agencies and private actors, especially the Treasury Department and payroll companies, to make sure they can handle payments such as these quickly, accurately, and with the appropriate vetting.2. Josh Hawley’s ideas for a Phase Four response to the pandemic’s economic damage earns NR’s High Five. Dr. Li might have disagreed with that sentiment. Alas, he was never able to voice his objections: He died after contracting COVID-19.The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) followed up with numerous other arrests, and publicly warned that it would punish anyone spreading “rumors” on social media. By mid January, On December 30, Chinese doctor This record of success makes the current corruption of the organization all the more shameful.Since its inception 112 years ago almost to the day, the World Health Organization (WHO)  has been credited with the eradication of smallpox and the near eradication of other devastating illnesses, including leprosy and river blindness.1.

Like many of us, I know people who have died, who have lost someone, who have fought and recovered from COVID-19. My life is made possible by people who haven’t ceased putting themselves in harm’s way. If there is only one thing that we learn from this quarantine time, may it be that everything good is a gift, and we are so much closer to one another and to the Creator of us all than we realize when we are sucked up in the business of everyday life. Coronavirus changing us has to be a choice. And it’s a choice between the soul’s life and death.  
     
   I’ve been missing something awful some of the men and women I see from day to day walking from St. Patrick’s to my office. They sit on Fifth Avenue — and more than one of them has told me they choose there because the wind isn’t as bad as the East side and the foot traffic is good. Well, not these days. I’m nowhere near midtown, like any of us who could escape, and I don’t know where they are. Like the UPS driver, they are encounters with Jesus for me on so many days. This time is reminding us of that — of all the ways God is present to us in the world. I pray someone is Jesus to them wherever they are.Now I recognize that this isn’t everyone’s faith. But gosh, when you have someone as a friend or neighbor who freely lives this, that’s not a bad deal. When we truly believe, we can be good friends and neighbors (to some of our good friends and neighbors who are our older brothers in faith or those who try to live good and decent lives without the kind of explicit supernatural help some of us rely on). Living the Beatitudes, we could even amaze you with our love. It’s amazing grace and all. And don’t we see it now, during this anxious time? A UPS driver delivered a package to me the other day: He had gloves on, and he wore a mask, though it was pulled down. He seemed to want to smile, with the brightest of smiles — and to make sure I saw it, that it brightened my day, whatever he was delivering. He seemed to want to show, simply by saying “Good morning,” that there is hope — that he has hope — that we need to be careful, but we also need to live and love one another.Now, what we’re finding among Catholics who truly believe in the On Palm Sunday, I happened to pray the Mass in Rome and Fifth Avenue, a few blocks from the White House, as well as Phoenix. On Holy Thursday, it was the Holy Father in an empty St. Peter’s, Providence in Rhode Island, and Cardinal Dolan in NYC again — and wrapping up the day with Los Angeles. You can go to some It drives me a little crazy that we say Masses are But this Holy Week, with public Masses unavailable live and in person, that three-Mass record is history. On the other hand, I get these notifications now on my phone and laptop for livestream Masses. Sometime when this quarantine got serious, I would find myself not going to sleep until Pope Francis’s morning (Rome time) Mass at Santa Marta at the Vatican. I seemed unable to go to sleep until the Church was praying again a new day.<span class=""small_caps""><span class=""drop"">N</span>ational Review’s</span>

In the end, we won’t have much choice; we’re not just going to lie down and die. We as a nation have survived the influenza pandemic of 1918, two World Wars, the Cold War, 9/11, earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, floods, and countless other calamities. The world has always thrown deadly challenges at us, and we have always found a way to meet them. In fact, we’re already working to find a way to meet this one: The worst-case scenario is, in short, ugly: recurring waves of infections and quarantines, a year or more until we can have mass gatherings, an unbearable number of untimely deaths, some who survive having to live with serious lingering health complications, an exhausted health-care system full of burned-out doctors, nurses, and staffers, and more laid-off workers than resulted from the Great Recession. But even if the worst-case scenario doesn’t come to pass, this will have been — and indeed, already has been — a gut punch to humanity.In theory, once the threat of the virus is gone, the economy should rebound quickly. But the reality may be different. How much disposable income that once could and would have been used on vacations, hotel stays, flights, cruises, and meals out at restaurants has evaporated in the face of mass layoffs and business closures? On paper, the only thing holding back those industries are government rules barring people from going out and patronizing them. But as the shutdown of American life continues, the savings of those laid off will dwindle, and those who have their savings tied up in a small business will face ruin. The bonanza of spending from the Fed and Congress may mitigate the damage somewhat, but it may also be too late in coming. President Trump signed that massive relief package into law March 27. The We are probably not out of the woods regarding the threat of disruptions to our national food supply, either. Four meat-packing plants in Pennsylvania The other frightening question facing the country, of course, is the catastrophic impact on the economy, starting with the health-care sector. It may seem odd to find hospitals struggling to stay open during a major public-health crisis, but the preparations for the coronavirus have spurred most of them to postpone all other nonessential medical procedures — the very procedures on which they make most of their money. By one estimate, Meanwhile, some percentage of those who fight the virus and defeat it may be far from back to “normal” for a long while. At least some patients who needed ventilators during treatment will take time to recover their lung capacity. Others who have spent time on ventilators for other respiratory ailments describe  We should expect additional waves of infection. The good news is that we should be better prepared for each subsequent wave, and it is less likely that we will see anything like long lines of   
   Although trying to flatten the curve, as those and many other countries have done, is the right strategy to ensure that hospitals are not overwhelmed, it also The Chinese government claims to have gotten the virus largely under control, but 
That said, the United States has endured close to 2,000 deaths a day for the past several days — we’re now experiencing something close to one new 9/11 every 36 hours. It is hard to imagine how anyone could look at that number of deaths and the prospect of tens of thousands more and construe it as anything less than an epic tragedy, one of the worst in our history.I won’t get into specific models or numbers, because one way or another, a lot of people in this country and around the world will have died from this pandemic before all’s said and done, and your perspective on just how devastating the losses are will probably be heavily influenced by whether or not people you know are among them. If the coronavirus kills three people you know personally, it will feel like a huge deal to you wherever the total death toll comes in relative to the official models; if the death toll outpaces the models but you don’t know any of the victims, it may feel like a far-off tragedy to you.Doctors strongly believed that the SARS-CoV-2 would be like most viruses in that critical sense, but we’re still not sure if it is. South Korean doctors have warned about cases that appear to be reinfection or perhaps a One giant question is whether human beings develop an immunity to SARS-CoV-2 once they’ve recovered from the initial infection. Once a person’s body detects an unwanted guest in the form of bacteria or a virus, it starts taking steps to get rid of that guest. (One of the ways to deal with a fear of the unknown is to attempt to envision it — to think through the worst-case scenarios, imagining what will happen if our luck gets even worse, if Plan A and Plan B don’t work. In the wrong hands, such an exercise might turn into scaremongering, but if done responsibly it can also be useful preparation: Once we’re ready to deal with the worst, almost anything else we face will seem easier.<span class=""drop"">W</span>

There was a time when a surprising number of Americans “believed” that aliens were on an abduction spree, but, for the most part, they weren’t demanding that the Pentagon take action. Much of what we like to think of as “belief” is really a performance, partly to ourselves, partly to others. Barack Obama “believes” (and he may even do so) that climate change poses a 
The logic of beliefs of this kind is that it throws up someone to blame, a prospect that boosts their allure. It offers the catharsis of revenge against the supposed perpetrators, or, at least, the gratification of having someone to hate. There’s also the not insignificant thrill that comes from the idea of having a role in a great drama. Most lives are a touch dull. For some, it will be much more exciting to believe that some massive conspiracy is afoot, especially, perhaps, if they have decided that they are its target, a notion that will resonate all the more strongly with the marginalized or the unsuccessful. The former will be eager to put the most malign face possible on those they feel — not always incorrectly — have done them down. The latter would rather turn to the comfort of an alibi than confront the reality that their most formidable adversary is not the Rockefellers or the Illuminati, but, quite often, themselves.And rarely more so when it involves a new pandemic, an onslaught that is as impersonal as it is intimate. That its deadliness may come from the way an infection may turn the body against itself adds to the existential terror of the afflicted or those waiting for the attack to come their way. That such a horror is both motiveless and meaningless adds insult to mortal injury. Under the circumstances, it’s not much of a surprise that — from the pandemics of the more distant past to the Conspiracy theories are a particularly powerful form of mythology, and it is that power that makes them so useful to charlatans looking for the next sucker.

Some are, as would be expected, the product of conventional propaganda operations.

No charge.But such enticements likely will not move governors in the hardest hit areas to re-open their economies early. Cuomo and Newsom so far have won widespread popular approval for their tough responses to the pandemic, and they will have strong incentive to continue their risk-averse policies. Democratic governors will remain conscious that their party will not reward cooperation with Trump, whom it tried to impeach and remove from office just two months ago. Nevertheless, Trump will have to persuade them that the gains in returning millions to work and re-opening businesses outweigh the harms of ending social distancing. Rather than his regular tactics of cajoling, blustering, threatening, and bargaining, Trump will have to convince them with facts and medical science — not his strongest suit. But his political fate, and the health of the American economy, will depend on it.Trump could use the money appropriated by Congress to respond to the pandemic as a reward for states that end their lockdowns in May. He could send disaster relief funds, made available by the Stafford Act in time of emergency, or allocate more medical equipment and protection supplies to these states, perhaps on the ground that they risk greater harm from the virus in exchange for opening up.Our unique federal system does not mean that Trump remains utterly powerless to bring the nation out of this unprecedented economic contraction. But he will have to rely less on command and more on persuasion. Congress more often gets its way in areas outside its direct control, such as in education, health care, and welfare, by paying states to adopt a uniform national policy. Article I of the Constitution provides that Congress has the power to tax and spend to “provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” The spending power already has provided the Trump administration with its most effective weapons in fighting the pandemic: It can provide critical supplies and medical equipment, transfer funds to states and cities or hospitals, and fund research on a vaccine and cure.When the federal and state governments have overlapping, competing powers, such as over economics or crime, they further must rely on their own resources for enforcement — which makes any White House command virtually impossible to carry out. In another set of federalism cases, these decided by the Rehnquist Court, a conservative majority forbade Congress from “commandeering” state officials into enforcing federal commands. If the federal government were to decide to re-open all businesses, it could call upon only on its own law enforcement officials to execute the policy. Washington simply does not have enough resources to manage such a vast task; the FBI, the closest we have to a national police force, has fewer agents than the NYPD has sworn officers.Congress can control commerce that crosses state lines, and even prohibit wholly intrastate activity that affects the national markets. It cannot, however, force individuals and businesses to engage in business in the first place. In 
But our federal system reserves the leading role over public health to state governors. States possess the “police power” to regulate virtually all activity within their borders. As the Supreme Court has recognized, safeguarding public health and safety presents the most compelling use of state power. Only the states can impose quarantines, close institutions and businesses, and limit intra-state travel. Democratic governors Gavin Newsom in California, Andrew Cuomo in New York, and J.B. Pritzker Illinois imposed their states’ lockdowns, and only they will decide when the draconian policies will end.But the federal government does not have that power. The Constitution’s grant of limited, enumerated powers to the national government does not include the right to regulate either public health or all business in the land. Congress enjoys the authority to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States.” This gives Washington, D.C. an important, yet supporting, role in confronting the pandemic. It can bar those who might be infected from entering the United States or traveling across interstate borders, reduce air and road traffic, and even isolate whole states.Our elected leaders confront the difficult decision on when to start lifting the lockdowns, even at the risk of a faster spread of COVID-19. Presiding Trump claims that he has the right to determine when businesses open their doors, employees return to work, and consumers shop again. “For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government,” he tweeted earlier today. “Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect . . . It is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons.”Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have rendered the trade-offs inherent in public policy only more acute. Even though the coronavirus has killed more than 23,000 Americans and sickened a half-million more, strict lockdowns have held deaths significantly below worst-case projections. On the cost side of the ledger, however, just one month of shelter-in-place policies has thrown more than 16 million people out of work and destroyed hundreds of billions of dollars in economic activity.<span class=""drop"">P</span>

No charge.His homily echoed down the deserted nave: “We still have a long way to go in the fight against COVID-19 and its consequences. There will be many more sacrifices to make before this is all over. But as surely as Christ rose on Easter morning, we will come through this, hopefully as better people, strengthened by the experience.”All this is to say that the rhythms of Irish political and social life have long moved in step with liturgical time. Important moments in the nation’s history ride off the coattails of religious festivals. And so it is that the pews fall silent. No chorus of voices greeted Archbishop Eamon Martin for his Easter Sunday Mass at Armagh Cathedral. However, the message remained the same.Each year, north of the border, in Northern Ireland, Catholics and Protestants are called to renew the hard-fought peace won under the Good Friday Agreement, which ended the Troubles in 1998. It is the depth of religious feeling shared by both communities that continues to solemnize the principles of this treaty.On O’Connell Street today, the worn portico of the General Post Office serves as a reminder not just of that “resurrection” but of the pain and death through which it was achieved. The Doubting Thomas can run his fingers over the bullet-scarred columns of the building and decide for himself whether Easter retains its spiritual power.  Some decades later, the body of the exiled rebel Jeremiah O’Donovan Rossa, recently returned from New York, was interred at Glasnevin Cemetery. In his stirring graveside panegyric, Patrick Pearse boasted that “life springs from death,” a sentiment he would act on during the failed Easter Rising of 1916. The rebellion was a masterfully conceived plan to elide the theodrama of Holy Week with the cause of Irish republicanism. Pearse’s execution by firing squad was the third act; the climactic finale was the changing of hearts, the birth of a sovereign nation.In 1843, as a member of the Westminster parliament, O’Connell delivered a speech on the Hill of Tara to hundreds of thousands of listeners. He called for the repeal of the Act of Union with Great Britain. Then, as now, the site is a rolling expanse of green fields. In ancient times, it was the seat of Gaelic kings. O’Connell’s opprobrium was steeped in the language of resurrection. “Those shouts that burst from you were enough to recall to life the kings and chiefs of Ireland,” he told the crowd.Dublin, on the other hand, has themes of sacrifice and the resurrection paved into its streets. Two of the city’s largest public spaces are called Phoenix Park and St. Stephen’s Green (whose biblical namesake was the first martyr for the Christian faith). Parnell Street, named for the messianic figure of Charles Stewart Parnell, intercepts O’Connell Street, where a statue of “The Emancipator” Daniel O’Connell stands.Consider the British capital. The imperial graveyard of London, with its Trafalgar Square, Waterloo Station, and countless cenotaphs and war memorials, sets the stage for an altogether different response to the coronavirus outbreak. “We must act like any wartime government,” said the U.K. prime minister Boris Johnson in a national address. “Yes, this enemy can be deadly, but it is also beatable.”Some may say that Ireland has gone too far down the path of secularization for the resurrection to be of any great import on occasions like this. On the contrary: The country is most affected, most mindful of the Paschal mystery in times of national crises. One can discern as much within its cityscapes, where architecture and space enshrine the national consciousness.Yet this is not reflective of the Irish people’s strong connection to the sacraments. Around 73 percent of newborn children While much ado has been made of the recent abortion and same-sex-marriage referendums, Ireland remains a deeply religious country. Of course, it is indisputable that the number of churchgoers is <span>NOW WATCH: </span>For Catholics, the act of sacrifice entails giving to God. In the context of Easter, that offering recalls Jesus’ agony in the Garden of Gethsemane: “Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.” The effect of this is to superimpose the passion narrative onto the nation’s hardships. There is purpose in suffering. Like Christ, citizens are called, in a national effort, to take up their own crosses. Their Veronicas are the doctors and nurses tending to the sick. Those that continue essential services are their Simons of Cyrene.In his four-minute speech, Varadkar mentioned “sacrifice” no less than five times. There is a lot in this word to unpack, and we should be forgiven for misunderstanding it as something troublesome, or merely inconvenient, although that is not what the taoiseach meant. Its significance runs much deeper.It is no surprise, then, that the head of government, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, chose this past weekend as the perfect time to announce a three-week extension to containment measures, which will run until May 5. “Throughout our history, Good Friday has had a special meaning,” he explained. “It’s a day associated with suffering, and sacrifice, and sorrow. And also with new beginnings. The promise of rebirth and renewal and better days to come.”As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads, the religious observance of Lent, and now Easter, looms ever larger in the Irish consciousness, shaping its response. Once again, the passion, death, and resurrection of Christ have reemerged as a powerful, sustaining force in the island’s national life.<span class=""drop"">E</span>

No charge.In short, I stand by everything I wrote, but by nothing that was written about me.Unfortunately, we should have Given the radically changing data, we simply do not know whether any of these hypotheses will stand — hence my original conclusion that California remained a mystery, but an enigma at least deserving consideration of lots of competing exegeses. And who, after all, could necessarily The severity of flu season made health care professionals think that patients were suffering from influenza given the similarity of some of the symptoms. In reality, however, a handful of sick Californians that were going to the doctor earlier this year may have been among the first to be carrying the coronavirus. “The virus was freewheeling in our community and probably has been here for quite some time,” Smith, a physician, told county leaders in a recent briefing. The failure of authorities to detect the virus earlier has allowed it to spread unchecked in California and across the nation. “This wasn’t recognized because we were having a severe flu season. . . . Symptoms are very much like the flu. If you got a mild case of COVID, you didn’t really notice. You didn’t even go to the doctor. . . . The doctor maybe didn’t even do it because they presumed it was the flu.”Front-line physicians who see sick patients do not necessarily agree with researchers in the lab. For example, a Perhaps, but that is yet another theory, not a fact, and one under medical contention, given that thousands of Californians, in the weeks when the virus was active but undisclosed in China, may have gotten the virus, were not tested and have never been tested. Moreover, for those who had or have COVID-19, no one yet knows when they were infected.In her piece, Hu says it is impossible that any Californian was infected prior to December 21 — her title is “No, You Did Not Get COVID-19 in the Fall of 2019.” She supports the impossibility of any U.S. infection in 2019 by citing Western researchers’ data that must rely in part on Chinese gene sequencing and transmission information, and the notion that the even if the virus was apparent in Wuhan by mid-November, it would have been impossible for it to reach the United States in the remaining six weeks of 2019.In the latter context, I should have added that U.S. intelligence and investigatory I certainly have posed questions about the need for huge numbers of unvetted Chinese students, but in a context that American universities charge them premium tuition rates while American students owe over $1.5 trillion in student debt — a point Hu left out.If anything — as we have seen in the modeling fiascos, the debate over the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, the role of the FDA in delayed initial testing, the WHO’s echoing of Chinese talking points, the CDC’s and surgeon general’s confusion over the epidemic’s initial threat, and the changing advisability of wearing masks — the arguments from authority are not always persuasive.The debate over public policy concerning the epidemic is According to her own logic, should I now investigate her own purported political beliefs and affiliations, or question her academic credentials, rather than what she actually wrote, and thereby ferret out her own “potential political motive” for her claims — all based on what a local outlet says she wrote?In melodramatic fashion, Hu seems to think that one should not have legitimate worries about the “science” of modeling, though such modeling has been subject to increasing criticism if not outright skepticism; that it is telling that I work at a “conservative” think tank and am a “military historian”; that I think too many Chinese students are studying at American universities; and that I think U.S. policy should be radically altered toward the Chinese government.  
   I did not write an op-ed “for” Fox News, but a syndicated column for the Tribune Content Agency, which alone determines its dissemination to a wide variety of regular and ad hoc subscribers. I raised possibilities but did not advance concrete conclusions about why California so far has experienced less viral morbidly than other, smaller states: “And in that regard, at least for a few days or weeks longer, California remains a mystery.”Most of what she writes in the essay is either sloppy, incoherent, or character assassination. Her information came from a Monterey station, not me. When the station called, I told the reporter explicitly that I was a historian who had considered various theories about the virus’s slower spread in the state, and I directed her to the NRO article. Hu has no information that I have written or stated anything close to what she implies. She suggests that I might have returned her inquiry — of which, at a time of a general lockdown of Stanford University, I have no knowledge. Certainly, she did not contact me on my personal email or phone at home as others frequently have.Hanson also (incorrectly) suggests that the virus’s spread in California came from “Chinese nationals” visiting California. Looking more closely at his recent work reveals a potential political motive for that claim; in a recent op-ed for So what’s really behind this theory? It might be worth considering the source. KSBW’s piece begins by mentioning Stanford Medicine’s research, then quotes Victor Davis Hanson, a Stanford-affiliated source; the piece reads as if Hanson is one of these aforementioned Stanford Medicine researchers. But Hanson is a military historian, The author did not seek to verify her sources, although she warned in the following that “it might be worth considering the source”:So, there was no infectious danger from Wuhan residents arriving in the U.S., but the Chinese government itself believed there was a danger from these same residents visiting other Chinese cities? Are the Chinese then racists for stopping their own citizens’ travel, while the Americans were not racist for still allowing it?And according to her own strange logic, if a writer of non-Chinese ancestry is racist for suggesting that direct flights from China to the U.S. sparked an epidemic, then one could just as stupidly suggest that someone of Chinese ancestry is racist for exempting the Chinese government from obvious culpability in allowing its citizens to fly into the U.S. from Wuhan at a time when it was already forbidden to fly from that city to other Chinese destinations.If the author really does not believe there were any epidemiological consequences of flying directly from Wuhan to SFO, then she should at least have the courage now to advocate that we lift all such “anti-Chinese travel bans” and stop such “dehumanization,” given that there’s supposedly even less risk now from Chinese arrivals than during the initial peak outbreak that she believes posed little risk through travel.A particular sloppy story in Some contacted the Hoover Institution and the medical school, and even the Stanford alumni association, voicing furor over my supposed impersonations and subversive views. I issued a   
   As most know, discussion of the virus in 2020 is often no longer just a public-health issue but a political one as well, and the argument from authority is often enlisted in the fray. Within hours, I was bombarded with furious phone calls and emails alleging that I was feigning medical credentials, that I was undermining the governor’s quarantine protocols, that I was a stooge for Donald Trump, and, from Chinese media, that I had perhaps “proved” that China could not be culpable for the virus given its presence in 2019 in the U.S.For some reason, a number of California news outlets took my NRO story as suggesting that somehow I not only stated that herd mentalityCertainly, both then and more recently, there have been a number of anecdotal accounts, media stories, and small isolated studies suggesting that more people than once thought, both In the meantime, for a few days at least, we are left with the California paradox. As with the apparent outliers of Germany, South Korea, and Japan, it reminds us that there are endless known unknowns about the origins, lethality, infectiousness, and patterns of travel of the coronavirus — and that today’s latest frightening statistical model is often superseded tomorrow by more realistic appraisals and theories, and then again rendered naïve by even more frightening new backlash models. Until now, without either widespread antibody or current-infection testing, the number of people who die from the virus in proportion to a given population base is about all we can rely on to determine the lethality of the disease. And in that regard, at least for a few days or weeks longer, California remains a mystery.Among these alternatives, I also listed the more controversial possibility that the virus might have been present in the state earlier than late January, when it was officially noted in the U.S. — a possibility that had been raised by others. In the article, I noted the pessimism of the Governor Newsom’s March 18 Two weeks ago, I also suggested that California therefore was a mystery, and I reviewed some possible explanations that others had raised to explain it. Were the current, rather surprising numbers a result of late and poor data, the recently enacted March 18 Draconian stay-at-home order of Governor Gavin Newsom, the fact that large rural areas of California are not densely populated, the temperate weather, or simply premature speculation given a huge, often promised spike to follow in days?
As I wrote in a recent Nonetheless, the state’s population is fairly certain. And for now, the number of deaths by the virus is the least controversial of many of these data, suggesting that deaths per million of population might be a useful comparative number.There is the now another old debate over exactly how the U.S. defines death No doubt there are lots of questionable data in all such metrics. As a large state California has not been especially impressive in a per capita sense in testing its population (about 200,000 tests so far). Few of course believe that the denominator of cases based on test results represent the real number of those who have been or are infected.<span class=""drop"">C</span>

But let us pray, too, that we do not allow this time of suffering to leave us unchanged.As some of us face job insecurity and uncertainty about the future, we should cultivate a greater understanding for those who regularly experience anxiety and depression, who always struggle to pay the rent or put food on the table. As we suffer through time away from friends and loved ones, we should cultivate sympathy for countless Americans who are consistently as lonely as we are right now, who spend most of their lives alienated from family and community.  
   For many of us, this might be a chance to remember or to learn about where our food comes from, to practice more gratitude for the many faceless people who provide it and move it from farms to our tables. Maybe we will give greater thought to the death statistics in a normal year and mourn for the lives we lose, even if they aren’t part of the greater toll of a pandemic.  
   Finally, I hope this strange moment in American life might create in all of us a greater desire to appreciate the good in those around us, to notice how often they improve our lives, and to understand their suffering and vulnerability. We ought never to forget Americans whose persistent hard work has been essential, especially those who are often taken for granted: grocery-store workers, farmers, janitors, security personnel, truck drivers, and delivery drivers.While I hope someday not to think about germs when I pass a neighbor on the sidewalk, I don’t want to lose the new friendliness we’ve gained. In the past, passersby would strain to avoid eye contact and walk by quickly as if no one else were around them. Now, most people passing each other outside smile and wave and even say hello, looking for human contact in the small moments of daily life, as if the Midwest demeanor had somehow spread to the East Coast.Where once the streets were packed with cars while sidewalks and yards were mostly empty, neighborhoods are now full of children biking up and down the streets or playing in the early evening with their parents in the front yard. This time of mandatory stillness and government-created homebodies might remind parents of the value of stepping away from the rat race, spending more time with their children, or sending their kids away from screens and out into the beauty of the world.Not only might this time of remote work help employers rethink what it means to be a productive employee, but it also might help the average worker reframe his work–life balance. Instead of our usual chronic busyness, many of us now confront empty days we need to fill, seemingly endless hours that allow us to seek true leisure rather than mindless entertainment to dull our anxiety at the end of a draining day and a long commute. Judging from what I’ve witnessed on my long walks through my Virginia neighborhood, suburban residents have changed their habits dramatically since the COVID-19 outbreak began.An increase in tolerance for teleworking would also help young parents. Think of a father who might work from home on some afternoons so he can make it to his son’s Little League games; picture a mother who would love to work part-time but can work only from home and at the times when her children don’t require attention. This 
This temporary shutdown certainly has revealed the importance of human contact and in-person workplaces, but it has illustrated, too, that modern technology gives us the gift of flexibility. Perhaps in the future, some companies will see the good sense in permitting employees to spend a few weeks each year working remotely, whether to care for an ailing parent, or to help a grown daughter who has just given birth to her first child, or even to enjoy the weather in another part of the country.At a smaller level, it’s easy to envision how daily life might improve in some ways as a result of what we’ve been through. For Americans lucky enough to have a job they can perform from home, this period of necessary teleworking could convince employers to be more lenient with workers who have demonstrated the ability to accomplish tasks outside the office.But not every shift in our mindset will have been for the worse, and we can work to draw good out of this evil. For one thing, we are forming habits that we ought to practice already for the sake of general good health, such as frequent handwashing, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue or an elbow. Many Americans, including some of our leaders, will emerge from this disaster with a healthy skepticism of the deceptive authoritarian regime in China and of the supposedly expert guidance from nongovernmental groups such as the World Health Organization.It’s easy to imagine, for instance, that it will be difficult to reorient ourselves to shaking hands without grimacing, wondering what germs a new acquaintance might carry. How long will it take to feel as comfortable as we once were in a large crowd at a concert or sporting event? We will have to work hard, at least at first, to silence the alarm bells in our heads when we pass a neighbor on the sidewalk, to stop seeing other human beings as a threat.Many observers have said that the United States will never really go “back to normal” after a pandemic such as this one — not that we will never have daily lives resembling what they once did, but that the new normal will be different in significant ways. Some things very well could change for the worse.<span class=""drop"">S</span>

Some of these innovations are useful, and some are of such long standing that the erroneous derivation behind them has been almost lost to memory. (“Cherry,” for example, came into English as the false singular of the French This isn’t the first time that Scalia has publicly assailed Not willing to let the matter go, Scalia went on, “It’s like Scalia stopped Barnhouse cold. “There is no such adjective,” he declared. “I know we have used it, but there is no such adjective as A lawyer named Randolph Barnhouse learned this lesson the hard way in November when he appeared before the Supreme Court as counsel to a company selling tax-free cigarettes over the Internet. Barnhouse said the opportunity to recover taxes on the cigarettes was an “inchoate” interest, not yet fully formed. “Any recovery would not be property until it became choate, until there was an amount of money assigned to it,” he explained.But not without a fight. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was known to stop lawyers using the term and lecture them about its illiteracy. “Choate” is not really a natural word; it is a lawyers’ neologism of relative recent vintage. Though it mostly appears in legal contexts, If you want to be treated like a superpower, then act like a superpower.Complaining is not going to get it done. Neither is cutting our contribution to this or that international agency — do you really think that Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus et al. are going to start flying coach if we short them a few hundred million, or do you think that money will come out of actual operations? We already know the answer to that.If we really want to see change in China — and don’t want to go to war in pursuit of “regime change” — then we have to be willing to use the tools that will actually get that job done, which isn’t a national sales tax on imported flip-flops. And it isn’t the United States threatening to leave the WTO: It is the United States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia threatening to expel China from the WTO and impose economic sanctions on the Beijing government, and doing so with a united diplomatic front. “Globalism” is precisely the instrument with which to bring Beijing to heel. Unilateralist tough-guy talk (and we’ve been hearing that since Bill Clinton in the 1990s — remember the “Butchers of Beijing”?) has got us nowhere and will get us nowhere.Getting real reform out of Beijing would take something else entirely. It would be nice to have, say, a leading voice in an Asia-Pacific economic bloc that includes every major economic power in the region except China, one that was designed specifically to counteract the outsized influence Beijing has in the area — which is exactly what the Trans-Pacific Partnership was supposed to be. That instrument was scuttled by so-called Instead of one of those options, we bitch and moan and complain, we make toothless threats, and we sometimes dickey around with tariffs, as though that were going to bring Beijing to heel. That’s a joke: The Trump administration, whose trade warriors present themselves as the tough guys when it comes to China, got bought off, and Or we could go with none of the above.We could abandon these organizations and attempt to replace them with new ones, preferably in alliances of liberal-democratic countries with a shared commitment to basic principles including procedural democracy, freedom of speech, property rights, the rule of law, minority rights, etc. One immediate challenge would be forging an American consensus on freedom of speech, property rights, trade, etc., which has at least partly unraveled. This, too, would demand of us a level of activity and commitment that the U.S. government may not be able to muster.We could work to We could simply declare these organizations beyond redemption, pull out, and go it alone. Conservatives have long dreamed of abandoning the UN. President Trump has spoken often of his desire to pull the United States out of the WTO. The calculation there is that the United Nations needs the United States more than the United States needs the United Nations, and that the same goes for the WTO — and that without the United States, these organizations would become incoherent and, eventually, inactive. The United States, this argument goes, would be in a better position to pursue its own interests unilaterally. Those are some pretty big assumptions; but, in any case, the United States has never shown any convincing willingness to pursue reform through exit.When it comes to the United Nations or the World Trade Organization, there are basically three possible avenues of progress.But instead of pursuing a program of genuine robust reform, we have pursued a program of passive aggression — heavy on the passive.The populist Right has long been contemptuous of the United Nations and its affiliates — and not without good reason. (The populist Left is less a bit less hostile, focusing its anti-globalist energies on an enemy it holds in common with the populist Right: multilateral trade accords, trade organizations, and affiliated agencies.) The UN is generally ineffectual and frequently corrupt. Some of its agencies are nakedly left-wing political projects designed to oppose the United States and its allies (e.g., UNRWA), others are centers of boutique radicalism (UNICEF), abortion mania (The Trump administration is calling for cuts to U.S. support for WHO. This is typical not only of the Trump administration but of the U.S. temperament in general when it comes to multinational organizations — and it is especially true when our policies are informed by the populist sensibility. And it is not going to produce the results we want.All true. What to do?Without China’s deceit and WHO’s solicitude for Beijing, the outbreak might have been more limited, and the world at the very least would have had more time to react. China committed unforgivable sins of commission, affirmatively lying about the outbreak and punishing doctors and disappearing journalists who told the truth, whereas the WHO committed sins of omission — it lacked independence and courage at a moment of great consequence.<span class=""small_caps"">National Review</span>In December, the WHO The leadership of the World Health Organization is awfully eager to please the junta in Beijing.

The advantage is that BSL-2 research and manufacturing capacity is available in abundance compared to BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities.A trip to the grocery store now poses a much greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than conducting vaccine research at a well-managed BSL-2 facility, where virus-handling occurs in a negative-pressure HEPA-filtered biosafety cabinet using a full complement of personal protective equipment. While the precautions in a BSL-2 facility aren’t, by definition, as extensive as BSL-3 precautions, BSL-2 facilities still use highly effective, institutionally engrained, federally regulated safeguards to avoid laboratory-acquired infections or accidental release of a pathogen into the environment.<a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/14/allow-bsl-2-labs-handle-novel-coronavirus/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Glenn Rockman argues</a>Yesterday’s Herd immunity protects people against the virus as it is, but it may not protect against a different version of the virus in the future. The question is how much the virus will change and how rapidly, and how much the “lessons” your body learns from fighting off one virus apply to future infections. We may need to be vaccinating to protect against variations of SARS-CoV-2 for many years to come.“You can get a new flu infection every year because your antibodies are not necessarily as protective,” says Andrew Brouwer, a research scientist and epidemiological modeler also at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health. “We don’t really know what that’s going to look like for this virus.”A virus’ mutation rate is another important factor in determining the severity of reappearances of an endemic virus. The flu is so pervasive because it mutates readily, swapping around the surface proteins that our immune systems rely on to recognize viruses.As of right now, Adalja says, the novel coronavirus displays all the signs of sticking around. It’s widespread in the population, transmits from person to person easily and there’s no vaccine that could grant immunity ahead of an infection.“We do know about other coronaviruses, it’s not like this is a virus that’s completely out of a new category,” says Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s Center for Health Security. “I think this will join those four other coronaviruses and have a similar pattern [of recurrence] after this first wave.”There’s precedent for a coronavirus becoming endemic in the human population. Actually, there are four of them: 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1. All four of these coronaviruses cause symptoms of the common cold, and infections are most often fairly mild.In yesterday’s <strong>But If This Virus Doesn’t Just Burn Out or Disappear in a Year or Two . . .</strong>The virus we’re currently battling appears to be less likely to kill you than original SARS. Unfortunately, it appears much more contagious — so a lot more people are catching it, and a lot more people are succumbing to it.And that’s . . . when SARS pretty much disappeared. We haven’t seen any cases in about sixteen years. The virus, as far as we can tell, died out in the wild or is no longer in human beings.By April 1, the United States was withdrawing diplomats from consulates in regions where SARS was spreading. By April 22, the U.S. issued a travel warning for Toronto, Canada. But then something wonderful happened: All of the efforts to contain SARS seemed to work. By May 6, the CDC declared containment in the United States to be successful, and month by month, one country after another came off the travel warning list. The World Health Organization issued a global alert for a severe form of pneumonia of unknown origin in persons from China, Vietnam, and Hong Kong on . . . March 12. (The virus spread around Chinese hospitals in January 2003 and arrived in Hong Kong by February. (One of the many reasons SARS didn’t permeate the American consciousness as one might expect is that the virus became widely known right as the United States and its allies were preparing for the invasion of Iraq.) Like this virus, international travelers brought SARS to countries like Vietnam, Canada, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand. By March, SARS was starting to infect people all over Asia.The first outbreak was in China’s Guangdong Province, and — you’re going to want to sit down for this, because it’s going to shock you — The original SARS — Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome — also was traced back to horseshoe bats in China’s Yunnan Province. The average American probably doesn’t remember the first SARS outbreak much; maybe you remember actor Peter Sarsgaard hosting <strong>Lessons from the Last SARS Outbreak</strong>What was . . . The research was designed to prevent the next SARS-like pandemic by anticipating how it might emerge. But even in 2015, other “During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,” states the Jan. 19, 2018, cable, which was drafted by two officials from the embassy’s environment, science and health sections who met with the WIV scientists. (The State Department declined to comment on this and other details of the story.)What the U.S. officials learned during their visits concerned them so much that they dispatched two diplomatic cables categorized as Sensitive But Unclassified back to Washington. The cables warned about safety and management weaknesses at the WIV lab and proposed more attention and help. The first cable, which I obtained, also warns that the lab’s work on bat coronaviruses and their potential human transmission represented a risk of a new SARS-like pandemic.In January 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending U.S. science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which had in 2015 become China’s first laboratory to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety (known as BSL-4). WIV issued a news release in English about the last of these visits, which occurred on March 27, 2018. The U.S. delegation was led by Jamison Fouss, the consul general in Wuhan, and Rick Switzer, the embassy’s counselor of environment, science, technology and health.

Ting complained that the request for comment was not sent through the “proper” channels and said she had to “verify” the request before commenting.“Consuls reach out periodically with governors, periodically they’ll come and talk to me as senate president, the speaker of the assembly, and so forth. But I have never had someone give me a resolution that they wanted me to pass on the Senate floor — never,” he explained. “So just the fact that they felt it was ok for them to do something so brazen . . .  for this communist party, to so desperately crave for and look for legitimacy, wherever they could get it — including in Wisconsin — by passing this sham of a resolution that they wrote, tells you just how worried they must be right now on how they’ve reacted to the outbreak here of the coronavirus.”In the course of vetting the authenticity of Ting’s email, Roth’s staffers were told by officials at the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation that Chinese diplomats routinely use private email accounts to conduct official business since it allows them to avoid internal red tape. Upon learning that Ting’s email was authentic, Roth says he “became very angry.”In a Monday interview, Roth told “China has been transparent and quick in sharing key information of the virus with the WHO and the international community, thus creating a window of opportunity for other countries to make timely response,” the resolution continues.The attached draft resolution, which was first reported by the “The Consulate General wonders if the Wisconsin State Senate could consider adopting a resolution expressing solidarity with the Chinese people in fighting the coronavirus. It [sic] yes, it would be a great moral support to the Chinese people combating the disease,” Ting wrote in the email. “Much appreciated if you could give it a serious consideration. We have drawn up a draft resolution just for your reference.”In a pair of February emails sent to State Senate President Roger Roth, which were provided to The head of the Wisconsin state senate recently received multiple emails from the wife of the Chinese Consulate-General in Chicago asking him to propose a resolution to praise China for its handling of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.National ReviewFollow Us",0,"Chinese Consulate Asked Wisconsin State Senate to Praise CCP for ‘Sharing Key Information’ about Coronavirus, Emails Show"

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Perhaps the nascent White House Economic Task Force will provide some clarity. We need straightforward descriptions of what evidence we still need to collect, what containment strategy the government will be pursuing, how containment will coexist with a revival of economic activity, and how we can measure progress. Such a statement would, at the very least, help gauge public support for the ongoing efforts.There is a temptation out there to assume that the lockdown Adding to the confusion is our inability to answer a fundamental question — namely, how useful has the lockdown been in the first place? Staying at home obviously can slow the spread of a virus, but there are other factors at play as well. As several NR contributors have already pointed out, the IHME model built the lockdown into its projections but still overestimated the caseload. Furthermore, the correlation between the severity of outbreaks across states and the timing of their lockdowns seems tenuous. Late-closing Florida is still far better off than New York, for example.Part of the confusion here is due to health officials gesturing at two different goals. Is social distancing intended to slow the spread and develop herd immunity, as a month of “flatten the curve” messaging claimed, or is it actually intended to minimize total infections? The former implies that we are probably ready to loosen restrictions; the latter implies a far longer and more painful quarantine.Another curious part of the lockdown is its universality. Some large fraction of the population will be infected as we develop herd immunity, but how do we ensure that the oldest and most immunocompromised people are not among them? Universal lockdowns seem to discourage targeted protections for the most vulnerable.Now peak resource use is supposedly upon us, but most hospitals are It’s not easy to grasp. Ever since “flatten the curve” became our mantra last month, the key metric seems to be hospitalizations. With widespread infection inevitable, the goal of the lockdown is to slow the spread enough to ensure that all critically ill patients have hospital beds. At the same time, we don’t want to impose any more economic pain than is necessary to keep the case load manageable. Logically, the ideal quarantine policy would be loose enough to keep hospitals near capacity but tight enough to avoid exceeding it.National ReviewFollow Us",0,The Logic of the Lockdown

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>No model can perfectly account for all of this, which means all of them represent a best guess — a projection based upon known data and current trends, not a prediction or a declaration from an oracle.Now imagine that instead, the virus spread to the man who lives in Kings Point, north of Boca Raton. Kings Point is tied for the oldest median age of any community in the state, at 77.7 years. There are about 6,700 people per square mile. A person unknowingly spreading coronavirus in this community would have serious consequences, and the many elderly residents of that community would be much more likely to require hospitalization and ICU beds — and would be much more likely to succumb to the virus.If she infects the man who goes home to Immokalee, a small unincorporated community southeast of Fort Myers, the consequences are likely to be mild. Immokalee is the third-youngest community in the state, with a median age of 24.7 years. The population density of the community is just under 2,500 people per square mile. Most of the residents of that community are young and hopefully relatively healthy, and even if our Florida Man unknowingly spreads it, the odds are good that the vast majority of the people he encounters will not need hospitalization or an ICU unit, and the odds of people dying are pretty low.But some of these small, unpredictable decisions can have far-reaching consequences. Imagine three people are on the beaches in Florida, and a woman unknowingly spreads SARS-CoV-2 to one of the two men she talks to, but not both. The first man lives in Immokalee, and the second lives in Kings Point.The final death toll will be determined by millions of tiny decisions — does this person stand too close to another, does this other person leave their house, does this third person wear a mask, does this fourth person cough into their hand and then touch a doorknob. It’s impossible to know all of them, so the model statisticians take their best guess based upon the data they have so far. When you only have Monday’s data, it’s tough to get a good sense of what the situation will be on Friday. But once you have Tuesday’s data, Friday gets a little bit clearer, and the same thing happens Wednesday, and by Thursday, you have a much better sense of what Friday will be like.The models are trying to account for a million little variables — how many people have it, how many people have it and don’t know it yet, how many more people the infected will come in contact with, the immune system strength of the people who have it and who will catch it, and so on.With the outlook looking much better than the models projected just a few weeks or even just a few days ago, you’re hearing a lot of complaints that “the models were wrong.”The most commonly-cited model, from Our National ReviewFollow Us",0,Every Model and Projection Represents a Best Guess . . . with a Lot of Variables

In seeking to solve an affordability problem that isn’t nearly the problem supporters of the plan have led us to believe, it would create much bigger problems. Policymakers should instead embrace the existing, actually successful student-aid system and improve upon it, rather than scrapping it for a radical, risky, expansive new federal program.Funding shortages and limited access aren’t merely theoretical effects of free college; they are a standard part of the international experience with it. For example, Finland offers free public universities, but it  Biden and Sanders aren’t wrong to anticipate that universities might seek to cut costs when they can no longer charge tuition and are beholden to state governments for nearly all of their revenue. Instead of ramping up funding, budget pressures might cause states to scrimp on annual appropriations to universities even with the new federal matching funds. If that is the response, then the free-college plan is likely to restrict access to higher education, not expand it. When budgets are tight, universities curtail their enrollment capacity, allowing fewer students to attend. To be sure, the plan says participating states can’t cut their funding below current levels, but it does not require them to increase funding beyond those levels, nor even to keep up with inflation or enrollment growth.For example, as currently written, the Biden plan does not establish a ceiling on the new federal matching grants, so there is nothing to stop a creative state legislature or public university from re-categorizing a wide range of programs and initiatives as part of the cost of operating a public university system to pick up more federal money. Federal policymakers will inevitably respond to such behavior with a prescriptive list of what is and is not an allowable higher-education expense. (Think Medicare-fee schedules but for public universities.) There is a hint of this already in the plan: Anticipating that universities might try to make up for lost tuition revenue by hiring more low-paid adjunct faculty, it sets a strict tenured-to-non-tenured faculty ratio for public universities that opt in.
At the core of the free-college plan is what progressive advocates call a new kind of “federal-state partnership” in which Washington would match state spending to fully subsidize tuition at public universities. Participation would be optional for states, and opting in would commit them to meeting a range of new federal requirements. Those requirements are the key centralizing feature of the plan, and as states and universities attempt to either game the system or tailor their new free-college plans to their own unique circumstances, the federal government is sure to impose more of them.That is where the second broad argument against the plan comes in. Biden’s plan will change incentive structures in the higher-education system in a way that could exacerbate existing inequities, while giving decisions that have historically been the purview of states and universities to Washington, D.C.To be sure, the chart shows that sticker prices have increased rapidly at public universities. But, contra the claims of free-college advocates, students and families have not borne those increases, because financial aid from states, the federal government, and colleges themselves has increased nearly as much as sticker prices on a per-student basis. This suggests that the existing financial-aid structure made up of targeted grants, tuition discounts, scholarships, and tax credits is hardly the failure that free-college supporters make it out to be. One might even conclude that it seems to be working pretty well, at least from the students’ and the universities’ perspectives. At a minimum, the substantial amount of aid available to students suggests that the radical new approach to the issue proposed by Biden and Sanders is a solution in search of a problem.

These data are from administrative records that reflect all aid that students actually received, not just what they were eligible to receive. In the 1995–96 academic year, students paid about $2,000 (in 2015 dollars) on average to attend an in-state public university after their student aid was applied. By the 2015–16 academic year, that number had risen just $400, to $2,400.There’s a reason for that: When you factor in student aid, the tuition picture changes dramatically: The prices that students from families earning less than $125,000 per year pay to attend four-year public colleges and universities have not increased nearly enough since the mid 1990s to justify the sweeping reforms that progressives support.A 2019 There are at least News of this radical policy shift was lost amid coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now there is a risk that it will escape the scrutiny it deserves.<span class=""drop"">F</span>

Instead, the provinces report nonsense, such as Jiangsu with zero deaths in a population of 80 million. The lessons China learned are all wasted, even harmful if decision-makers elsewhere believe China is offering accurate information and represents a model.”China’s figures “Other than the outbreak site of Hubei, Chinese provinces not only top the list of best-performing areas in limiting Covid, they do so by a huge margin.

Democratic governor Tony Evers deserves his fair share of blame for What does the liberal victory in Wisconsin mean going forward? It shrinks the conservative majority to 4–3, and it gives liberals a chance to win a majority in 2023. But it’s hard to find any relationship between Wisconsin supreme court elections and presidential elections. A narrow conservative victory in the spring of 2011 was followed by a decisive win for Barack Obama in 2012. A double-digit liberal supreme court victory in 2015 was followed by Donald Trump’s surprise upset in 2016. Another double-digit liberal victory in 2018 was followed by a one-point loss for former GOP governor Scott Walker that fall.In Wisconsin’s spring 2016 elections, there were competitive Republican and Democratic presidential primaries, and the performance of supreme court candidates down-ballot corresponded almost perfectly with the turnout in the presidential primaries. That year, 97,219 more ballots were cast in Trump–Cruz–Kasich GOP race than in the Clinton–Sanders Democratic race, and the conservative supreme court candidate won by 95,515 votes.In 2019, when a supreme court race was the most important contest in Wisconsin’s statewide spring election, the conservative candidate won with 606,000 votes, defeating the liberal candidate by less than one percentage point. In 2020, losing conservative candidate Dan Kelly got 693,000 votes — 87,000 more votes than the victorious 2019 conservative candidate. But in 2020, nearly 900,000 votes were cast in the Democratic presidential primary (about 100,000 fewer than were cast in the 2016 Democratic primary), and the liberal supreme court candidate won 856,000 votes down-ballot.Total turnout for the April 7 elections ended up being roughly what could have been reasonably expected under normal circumstances when a Democratic presidential primary is combined with a state supreme court election.
The Democratic primary at the top of the ticket and the absence of a competitive GOP presidential primary still seem to be the biggest factors determining the outcome of the down-ballot supreme court race.The last-minute fight between the Democratic governor and the Republican legislature over postponing the election may have had some effect on the size of the liberal victory, but it probably wasn’t a big one. A record 1.1 million votes out of 1.5 million total votes in the April elections were cast absentee (either by mail or in-person early voting), but most of those votes were cast before the fight over postponing the election erupted. Democratic governor Tony Evers did not call for postponing the election until the afternoon of Friday, April 3, and the deadline to request absentee ballots was 5In 2018, Republicans were so worried about the advantage the primary would give the liberal candidate down-ballot that they considered <em>New York Times</em><span class=""drop"">C</span>

No charge.<strong>Editor’s Note: </strong>The American people should have as much health-care freedom as possible, especially during this pandemic. The rules surrounding HSAs need to be relaxed and reformed. Though this bill takes one necessary step in temporarily decoupling HSAs from HDHPs, we must also consider making the policy permanent. It’s time for Congress to modernize by making HSAs widely available for all Americans.In addition, given the beating the stock market has taken as a result of the pandemic, HSAs are a perfect way to help Americans save for health-care costs before or during retirement.Decoupling HSAs from HDHPs not only helps seniors, but also veterans on TRICARE and those who receive VA benefits, who would be allowed to have an HSA. In short, decoupling gives more Americans health-care flexibility when they need it most.That is why we recently introduced the Pandemic Health Care Access Act. This legislation temporarily decouples HSAs from HDHPs, allowing more Americans to hold an HSA to save for health-care expenses during the coronavirus pandemic. Specifically, our legislation would allow any American on any health-care plan to qualify for an HSA, including seniors on Medicare who often pay thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs (even with Medigap plans).
Because of the HDHP mandate, people can’t obtain medical services covered under their plan if they haven’t yet met their deductible. If they haven’t met their deductible, folks are pushed into a situation wherein they dip into their HSA or out- of-pocket savings to cover the cost. If an individual were simply able to use an HSA with any health-care plan, not just a HDHP, they could use their health savings to pay for care. Importantly, decoupling HSAs from HDHP’s would make it more likely that folks would take the opportunity to save for health-care tax-free (because they’d have greater access to HSAs), and experience some of the health-care freedom that doesn’t exist in our current system.Without this emergency notice, Americans whose HDHP agreed to cover COVID-19 testing and treatment would have completely lost their ability to contribute to an HSA.While new health-care delivery systems have come along and new health plan designs have evolved for two decades, current law doesn’t allow HSAs to benefit from most of these new designs due to the original HDHP requirement. For example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had to rush to create an emergency notice to allow COVID-19 testing and treatment to be a free benefit for the millions of Americans with an HSA-eligible HDHP. In its notice, the IRS explained that in this instance, HDHPs We should permanently abolish this mandate.Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are facing a similar situation today. Since their inception, Congress has barely updated them to keep up with the times. As a result, Americans must still abide by an out-of-date mandate that only allows them to qualify for an HSA if it is paired with a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP).<span class=""drop"">W</span>

Wouldn’t it be shameful to take them out of context and suggest otherwise? Wouldn’t it be disgraceful to imply that, because they phrased something poorly in the heat of the moment, there is something lacking in their character? Especially when we know the opposite is the case?In their craven essay, the congressmen note recently revised models that forecast “just 20,000 fatalities in the [United Kingdom].” Of course, they are not really suggesting that “just 20,000 deaths” are trivial. “Just” was an unfortunate choice of words. Their point, plainly, was that 20,000 fatalities, while tragic, paled in comparison to the 510,000 deaths projected by an earlier model.Biggs and Buck posit, “The economic calamity lies largely with the origination of policies resulting from Fauci’s recommendations.” Really? Who, after hearing from the experts, adopted the policies? Is it now known as the Fauci’s job is public health, with a focus on infectious disease. It is to be expected that he is predisposed to emphasize the risks of a pandemic, from which over 20,000 Americans have died. If the congressmen believe that this is the wrong emphasis, and that the president is getting too much input from the doctors and not enough from economists, then their problem is with Biggs and Buck need to man up.In the moment, was Fauci’s use of “inconvenient” an understatement? Okay, sure, but c’mon. He clearly said it to conform to White House messaging: The restrictions are necessary even though there are significant costs; but the administration believes those costs will be temporary and does not want to alarm the country by suggesting that they are ruinous.Yet, in their op-ed, these congressmen risibly mined from Fauci’s voluminous body of written and oral presentations a single invocation of the word “inconvenient” to describe the effects of social-distancing and business restrictions. It shows, they say, that the 79-year-old doctor, who has dedicated his life to healing, is insensitive to human suffering. “For Fauci,” they harrumph, “is it merely a societal or economic inconvenience that about 17 million workers are unemployed because of the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic?”
As we’ve all heard over the past month, Dr. Fauci has worked long hours through seven-day weeks trying to save American lives. He also has made countless statements in scores of interviews and White House Task Force press conferences. Consistently, he has been a model of empathy. Again and again, he has agonized over the excruciating choice that government officials have no choice but to make: The choice between the well-being of (a) those sick from, dying of, and vulnerable to a potentially lethal infectious disease, and (b) those whose financial, emotional, and physical well-being are being shattered by the shutdown. It has worn on him, like it would wear on any of us. Like it would wear on Andy Biggs and Ken Buck.Of course, the word on which the lawmakers seize is “inconvenient.”Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently said, “It’s inconvenient from a societal standpoint, from an economic standpoint to go through this.” It is interesting sometimes that a brief comment can reveal the heart and mind — and in this instance, a special degree of tone deafness.Let me quote them at length, so you don’t think I’m misrepresenting them:The point of the Biggs/Buck op-ed was to portray Dr. Fauci as if he were a callous, bean-counting bureaucrat, devoid of human compassion for COVID-19 victims.Here’s the problem: In their op-ed, Representatives Biggs and Buck did it for real . . . to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious-disease adviser on President Trump’s coronavirus task force.Now, rest assured, I have done this only to make a point. In reality, I am quite confident that these two gentlemen believe every COVID-19 death is one death too many. I’m sure they are horrified by the thought of 20,000 fatalities in one place, over a short period of time. But if I were doing this for real, if I were distorting their statements for political reasons, with a motive to make you believe they just don’t care, I’d be the worst kind of demagogue.Now, it is atrocious of me to say such a thing. After all, it’s not true. And <span class=""drop"">C</span>

So the question is, even under a gradual reopening of the economy, does that increase the number of cases beyond what the country’s hospitals can handle?But as we learned from the Joker, Keeping in mind that all models are projections, not predictions — meaning they tell you where things are, and where they are most likely but not certain to go, based upon what it known at the time — by one estimate, <a href=""https://www.masslive.com/coronavirus/2020/04/coronavirus-in-massachusetts-baker-administration-says-to-brace-for-difficult-days-ahead-as-health-officials-announce-113-new-deaths.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Massachusetts</a>Around the rest of the country, the use of hospital and ICU beds is well below capacity.Of the state’s 6,088 adult ICU beds, 3,874 are filled, leaving 2,214 (36.37 percent) available. Of Florida’s capacity of 592 pediatric ICU beds, 258 (43.58 percent) remain available.Miami-Dade’s hospital bed availability — which has dropped to 14.67 percent on Friday afternoon — is back up to 40.66 percent (3,363 beds available out of 8,271).As of Monday afternoon, there were 59,809 staffed hospital beds statewide and 34,708 were filled, according to numbers self-reported by hospitals. That leaves 25,101 (or 41.97 percent) of the beds available. That’s an increase in availability since Friday afternoon, when just 33.16 percent of Florida’s hospital beds were available.It’s a As of April 13, Illinois has a total of 30,134 hospital beds, 2,987 of which are intensive care unit (ICU) beds. The state has 33 percent of all ICU beds available, 994 of 2,987, and 58 percent of ventilators are available, 1,742 of 3,140.As of April 13, 4,283 known COVID-19 patients and suspected COVID-19 patients were hospitalized. COVID-19 patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) totaled 1,189, and 796 patients are on a ventilator. Suspected COVID-19 patients are individuals under investigation and assumed to have COVID-19 for the purpose of medical treatment.Chicago and the surrounding areas in Illinois have a lot of cases, but One theory worth further study: We know The state had raced to surge its medical capacity, especially in the New Orleans area, as modeling over the past month showed the region on track to run out of hospital beds in ventilators. But a 1,000-bed temporary hospital facility at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center only housed 84 patients Tuesday, which Edwards’ administration said was good news and indicated the state’s stay-at-home order was working as intended.A few weeks ago, people were really worried about New Orleans turning into the next New York, but In Washington State, the situation is similar to New Jersey: Hospitals can <a href=""https://wtop.com/coronavirus/2020/04/alexandria-health-director-says-hospitals-meeting-challenge/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Across the river in northern Virginia, the outlook is brighter</a>One other location There’s a quote in that story that is useful to keep in mind: ‘The peak is only halfway there.”The number of new coronavirus cases reported Monday, April 13, was 997, down considerably from the peak of 1,953 on April 3. On Tuesday, April 14, Michigan reported 1,366 new cases.An emergency room doctor for Detroit Medical Center told MLive she’s seeing “significantly” fewer patients than just a week or two ago, while a McLaren Health Care doctor says he’s “cautiously optimistic” about the trend in metro Detroit.Caseloads are easing in Henry Ford hospitals, according to the CEO of the Henry Ford Medical Group in Detroit.Michigan doctors and other health experts say they’re beginning to see signs that Michigan is turning a corner in its battle with coronavirus COVID-19, especially in southeast Michigan.But that was early April, and at least right now, The two sources tell CNN that at least one room, which is typically used for studies on sleeping habits, was used to store bodies because morgue staff did not work at night, and the morgue was full.Two other emergency room workers confirm the photos are an accurate portrayal of CNN acquired the photos from an emergency room worker.Photos shared among emergency room staff at Sinai-Grace Hospital in Detroit show bodies being stored in vacant hospital rooms and piled on top of each other inside refrigerated holding units brought into the hospital’s parking lot.After New York City and northern New Jersey, Detroit might be the part of the country hardest hit by the virus. Hospital chiefs in the Garden State now say the “main challenge now is neither hospital beds nor ventilators, but staff to put them into use.”New Jersey Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli reported Tuesday that 8,185 residents statewide were hospitalized with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, an increase of 4 percent from the previous 24 hours. A quarter of the patients were in intensive care, as of 10:30 p.m. Monday, and 20 percent — 1,626 people —  needed ventilators to breathe.At The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, Paul Simon’s “Homeward Bound” emanates from the public-address system 15 or so times a day — every time a COVID-19 patient is discharged.“When the water keeps rising, we keep finding higher ground,” said Brunnquell.Admissions fluctuate from day to day, but the trend line is flatter. More patients are being sent home. Test results come back more quickly. Ventilators to help the most critically ill have arrived from the state’s central repository. Personal protective equipment is in hand for a few days, a previously alarming timeline that now seems reassuring.“We’re all cautiously optimistic,” said Dr. Stephen Brunnquell, president of the physician network at Englewood Health, referring to his daily call with the chief medical officers of hospitals in Bergen and Passaic counties. “We’re getting the job done.”Across the Hudson River in New Jersey, the The executive director of Staten Island University Hospital says they are seeing a leveling off in the number of new cases. Between the two campuses, Dr. Brahim Ardolic says they get around 60 new patients related to the coronavirus a day.Staten Island has taken over the Bronx for the highest rate of cases per 100,000 people, according to health officials. That could be caused by the state’s efforts to increase testing.“I think that means we are starting our peak,” said Israel Rocha, CEO of Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst. “That means very soon here in Elmhurst in Queens we will start our trajectory down and that means our community is on the road to recovering from COVID-19.”Now, the hospital’s CEO says they are seeing fewer people for testing and treatment. The volume of patients is growing at a slower rate every day.Once considered the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak for the city, the city’s Elmhurst Hospital saw 13 deaths within a 24-hour period and lines of people along adjacent streets waiting for testing at the end of last month.The bad news is that the nightmare scenario did strike certain hospitals for several days. But the good news is that, at least for now, these facilities don’t seem overwhelmed anymore. Generally, New York City hospitals are I happened to have been assigned to work at one hospital for a chain of shifts, so I hadn’t been inside one of our other hospitals in over a week. As soon as I open the E.R. doors there, I shrink from the sights and smells. Patients are now triple-bunked into single-person spaces, curtains pushed aside. In one room, three men, who appear to be in their 80s or so, are side by side in their stretchers, each one pulling at his oxygen mask, confused, their frail limbs swinging in the air. Some have sat in their own feces for a day. Puddles of urine have pooled around the wheels of some patients’ stretchers. Nurses are out sick; the remaining ones are coping the best they can. I have gotten texts from colleagues about the chaos here, but I thought that those were just about one bad day, that they had already gone through the worst.Before everyone jumps on the “ah-HA!

However, it remains considerably below last week’s level as states grapple with shortages of test tubes and swabs. Another factor causing that decrease is the Independent of New York City’s revisions, new cases and deaths also increased nationally yesterday, with an especially large spike in New Jersey. The next week or so is projected to take a large toll as the U.S. approaches the peak of its domestic outbreak.The death toll from coronavirus in New York City jumped by nearly 4,000 on Tuesday, to a cumulative total of more than 10,000. Health officials revised previous numbers to account for presumed cases: individuals who had died with symptoms of the virus but not tested positive for it. The revisions highlight the difficulty of interpreting official health figures in the fog of the pandemic.

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.That is a big problem.My point remains the policy determinations that must be made. To repeat my refrain, critical decisions are being made based on projections and models cobbled together by federal, state, municipal, academic, and private experts in public health. The more these estimates are scrutinized, the less reliable they appear to be. Yet decisions about whether to reopen the economy, when to do so, and under what restrictions hinge on them.It is not my purpose here to intimate that the CDC and other federal health officials, embarrassed by how badly inflated their models of anticipated COVID-19 deaths have proven to be, are scheming to overcount. Undoubtedly, some people will politicize the numbers to serve their own agendas, but I’m confident that health officials would like to see COVID-19 deaths reach zero, not zoom into the stratosphere.The CDC instructs officials to report deaths as COVID-19 deaths whenever the patient has either tested positive or, despite the absence of a test, presents circumstances from which presence of the infection can be inferred “within a reasonable degree of certainty” — such that its contribution to death is “probable” or may be “presumed.” This is drawn from New York City is dysfunctional, but this is not a New York issue. The guesstimating is being done at the express invitation of the federal Centers for Disease Control.Who knows? The fact is, they are just making estimates. But, as the Meantime, health officials have been tracking deaths they’ve hypothesized City health officials deduce that some of the spike in “excess deaths” is only indirectly attributable to the coronavirus. On this theory, COVID-19 infections so overwhelmed the health-care system that some non-infected people are assumed to have died of conditions that would otherwise have been treatable.But to what degree? We really don’t know. In truth, we will never know beyond educated supposition.Despite the lack of coronavirus diagnoses in these cases, the inference that it was a factor in death (or, as the city insists, the proximate cause) is not irrational. The Health Department says that 3,000 more people died in the last month than would ordinarily have been expected in the City this time of year. The City has been vexed by the sparse availability of testing. By counting only people who had tested positive, it was surely undercounting COVID-19 deaths to some degree.Still, quantifying fatalities and the mortality rate remains elusive. Case in point: New York City. Obviously, the increasing (but still insufficient) availability of testing is affecting the tallies. This should give us some comfort: The reported number of new cases seems to be coming down as testing becomes more widespread. Cause for hope that we are, in fact, turning the corner.What gives? Well, the main problem right now is New York. As governor Andrew Cuomo noted yesterday, although daily deaths seemed to be edging downward, below 700 on Monday for the first time in a week, they spiked up over 800 again on Tuesday. (Gov. Cuomo is nevertheless heartened by a decrease in hospitalizations, which will hopefully lead to a trend of declining cases and fatalities.) There were also marked daily death toll increases in New Jersey, Louisiana and Michigan, and less pronounced but noticeable increases in Massachusetts, Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Texas.Initially, deaths also seemed to be dropping markedly: from around 2,000 per day from April 7 through April 11, down to about 1,500 on Sunday and Monday. Then, suddenly, deaths shot up on Tuesday, to 2,407, by far the highest one-day total yet (surpassing the previous high of 2,035 recorded on April 10).It would overstate the matter to say that the tally of new cases is “plummeting,” but the drop has been noticeable: from a level of over 30,000 new cases per day from April 6 through April 11 (and, on three of those days, over 33,000 new cases), we’ve been down to about 27,000 on each of the three days since Sunday.Those of us who have been watching the daily numbers closely could not help but notice the dark cloud that drifted Tuesday over what was otherwise cautiously optimistic news. The number of coronavirus cases seems to be dropping, but deaths are suddenly spiking.

Until Stephen Douglas in 1860, American presidential candidates did not stump for themselves. Until Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925, Supreme Court nominees did not appear to testify before Congress. Donald Trump broke another norm on the Supreme Court selection process by running in 2016 on a public list of potential nominees. It is not clear that the norm against touting yourself as a VP candidate actually serves any purpose. If Abrams’s gambit succeeds, expect imitators.Whether or not Abrams would be a good pick — Americans may be hesitant to see a presidential nominee of Biden’s advanced age choose a running mate who has never served in an office higher than the state legislature — she has not been hesitant to break norms before. She has openly and repeatedly refused to accept the legitimacy of her election loss, despite the convention of losers not trying to tear down the democratic legitimacy of American elections to avoid admitting defeat. She entertained a long, public musing on whether she might run for president or the Senate in Georgia in 2020. Perhaps she has less concern about dignity than someone actually serving in statewide office, and more about forcing the national conversation to take her more seriously than her record would justify.She told the Obama-alumni Stacey Abrams does not give the expected answer when I ask if she would accept an offer from former vice president Joe Biden to serve as his 2020 running mate. “Yes. I would be honored,” Abrams says. “I would be an excellent running mate. I have the capacity to attract voters by motivating typically ignored communities. I have a strong history of executive and management experience in the private, public, and nonprofit sectors. I’ve spent 25 years in independent study of foreign policy. I am ready to help advance an agenda of restoring America’s place in the world. If I am selected, I am prepared and excited to serve.”Stacey Abrams, the unsuccessful 2018 Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia, has clearly decided to ignore that norm and openly campaign for the job. Abrams American politics has its norms and polite fictions. Presidential candidates are not supposed to admit that they are running for president until they are ready to formally launch, a tradition that has led dozens of candidates to flatly lie about their intentions. Vice presidential prospects are not supposed to openly stump to be considered, in part because it is seen as somewhat beneath the dignity of senators, governors, and recently defeated presidential contenders to admit wanting a second-banana job, partly out of concern for upstaging the nominee.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Stacey Abrams Is Campaigning for Vice President

Of course, information about the virus is — to understate the point — useful. I certainly would not suggest we trade our experience for theirs. But the modern proliferation of information exacts a certain psychic cost over and beyond the pandemic itself — I have, on occasion, wondered if there was a morbid comfort to be found in being spared the dueling opinions of experts and their models.All the citizens did little else except to carry dead bodies to be buried . . . At every church they dug deep pits down to the water-table; and thus those who were poor who died during the night were bundled up quickly and thrown into the pit. In the morning when a large number of bodies were found in the pit, they took some earth and shovelled it down on top of them; and later others were placed on top of them and then another layer of earth, just as one makes lasagne with layers of pasta and cheese.I have wondered how our experience of this pandemic — saturated as it is with competing models, charts, and technical experts — compares to that of the average person who survived either of the two major medieval outbreaks of the bubonic plague.

But note that for any action on Capitol Hill, it would be necessary for lawmakers both to be physically present (since the push for remote voting has stalled) and to come to some consensus. Neither of these is a sure thing at the moment, to say the least.Under federal budgetary law, the president may temporarily halt the funding and send a rescission message to Congress, asking for the appropriated funding to be rescinded, explaining why, and describing the impact doing so. Congress would then have 45 days to act on the request, which can be fast-tracked (i.e., the usual parliamentary rules that slow or prevent action are not applicable). If Congress failed to act, the president would be required to spend the funding as Congress has directed.The other route, a formal rescission of funding is more difficult.I’d wager that the surest way to cut off the WHO and make it stick is to shift the appropriated WHO funding to COVID-19 relief for the states. They are stressed by the outbreak and pleading for more federal dollars. For all the bellowing Democrats are doing today about the prospect of cutting off the WHO, they’d have a hard time protesting additional funding for their states and districts. Indeed, even now, many Democrats are being careful not to defend the WHO; rather, they suggest that Trump is blame-shifting and attempting to scapegoat the WHO for his own failings.The simplest route is to repurpose the congressionally authorized funding. We’ll have to see what the budgeting fine print says, but as we noted when the president reprogrammed some Defense Department funding for the purpose of border-wall construction, presidents often have wiggle to move appropriated money around. This is especially so when there is a national emergency. Recall that there are many emergency provisions in federal law, some going back decades, through which Congress has given the president spending discretion. Recall in addition that Which, naturally, raises the question: Is it legal for the president to do this? Probably so, but it’s tricky.The question presses because the United States is the top financial backer of the WHO. No other country is close. The WHO’s budget is about $6 billion per annum, and the American contribution is over $400 million — about President Trump announced yesterday that he plans to halt U.S. taxpayer funding for the World Health Organization.

A comprehensive review of ventilation conditions in Chinese indoor environments by Ye et al. showed that the CO2 concentration can reach 3,500 ppm in some buildings. The design and operation of buildings have also been under pressure to reduce energy use and increase human productivity.One potential contributing factor to the virus’s potency indoors is the poor air quality that characterizes some urban buildings, which can facilitate the spread of COVID:Emphasis mine. As the researchers note, the fact that most coronavirus clusters and outbreaks occurred indoors is not particularly surprising given the Chinese government’s enactment of stay-at-home orders. But while the study “does not rule out outdoor transmission of the virus,” it notes that “among our 7,324 identified cases in China with sufficient descriptions, only one outdoor outbreak involving two cases occurred.”Three hundred and eighteen outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, involving 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. We divided the venues in which the outbreaks occurred into six categories: homes, transport, food, entertainment, shopping, and miscellaneous. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, and only 1.6% involved ten or more cases. Home outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed by transport (108; 34.0%; note that many outbreaks involved more than one venue category).

   Nothing about this epidemic was ever static. But we are on the verge of learning a lot more about the virus that will result in as much disagreement as relief.Both sides know, but will deny, that politics plays a role in how they view the crisis.As the days pass, the November election also draws nearer. Every presidential decision concerning the epidemic will be inevitably politicized. Trump supporters will likely favor a quick return to work to avoid a November recession. His opponents prefer a longer shutdown.China has never come clean about the origin and spread of the virus that broke out in Wuhan. But more information is leaking out. Soon, Beijing will have to decide whether it will become part of the answer to the mystery or continue its cover-up.Thousands of scientists worldwide are running a frantic Nobel Prize race to discover a vaccine for COVID-19. Each week, we will hear that they are either getting closer to discovery or learning that the code of the new virus is proving harder to crack.Timelines grow shorter. The virus and the draconian reaction to it are wearing down a quarantined America.Economists will likely urge him to restart the economy as fast as possible. Epidemiologists will warn of a second viral spike if millions go back to work. Trump will either be praised for saving the American economy or damned for dooming thousands.In the coming days, the president will have to make a lose-lose decision to either inaugurate a graduated return to work or keep the country locked down for weeks longer.The somnolent economy is analogous to a patient who is to be brought back from a forced coma. No one quite knows how, or even if, the economy will fully awaken — only that the chances it might not increase the longer it stays comatose.Some parts of the country are now nearing a month of shelter-in-place policies. The economists warn that we are already in full recession and the current lockdown is not sustainable for much longer. Their mounting worry is not just about economic devastation but about a greater loss of life than COVID-19’s toll through wrecked livelihoods, stress, substance abuse, suicides, and the inability to address medical issues.The weather is warming as we reach mid-spring, and summer approaches. Still another debate may soon be settled. Will rising temperatures slow the epidemic, as some confidently predicted based on other viral outbreaks? Or are skeptics right that the coronavirus will still spread and is hardier than the seasonal flu?But soon, the formal trial results should determine whether the drug offers only false hope or speeds recovery and saves lives. Lots of reputations are on the line.There are ongoing trials to determine the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. President Trump and some health officials have touted the controversial anti-malarial drug as a possible treatment. Other health officials are skeptical.If other experts are discovered to have unduly played down the deadliness of the virus, they will be derided as callous and partly responsible for the outbreak’s mayhem.If past predictions are proven too gloomy, their authors will still claim that their doomsday prognoses at least prompted needed social distancing. Critics will counter that their paranoia caused untold social and economic damage.The prior pessimism of most epidemic models will either be confirmed or refuted, depending on the percentages of Americans who have already weathered the virus.Those with antibodies will likely be able to return to work with little risk. Arguments will arise over whether their status should be cataloged and banked, or whether such classification would institutionalize creepy two-tier categories of citizenship.
Likewise, there will be greater precision in distinguishing those whose deaths were exclusively virus-related from those who were afflicted by serious chronic illnesses along with the virus. That will also help provide better data about the actual toxicity of the virus.With a more trustworthy denominator to compare against known deaths, we will finally learn just how lethal the virus is and whether comparisons to a severe annual flu are legitimate or still inapplicable.Antibody testing is expected to get under way shortly. Soon, several representative studies will give the country an accurate idea of how many Americans have been infected in the past few months.Greater information about the virus might cause as much acrimony as conciliation. Some experts will be discredited, others reaffirmed.A number of concurrent developments are coming to a head. Most will bring light where so far there was only heat.<span class=""drop"">W</span>

My recommendation is: Don’t let us get away with it, too much. There are many writers, many talkers, many outlets in these United States. There are even many writers and many talkers within individual outlets. Usually, when we say “the media,” we mean writers and talkers and outlets we don’t like. Almost no one uses “the media” positively.Anyway . . .“Common good” sounds good, doesn’t it? But beware: It usually boils down to “Do it my way.

Some people call themselves “common-good conservatives.” David says, “I tend to think that liberty has independent value. . . .

I have enjoyed getting reacquainted with him a bit.In his speech for Hull, [Jahn] cited and praised the laureate’s fathering of the U.N., of course. But he spoke about much more than that. Hull had evidently not received the Nobel prize for the U.N. alone. Jahn spent some time on Hull’s career-long devotion to lower tariffs and free trade, hailing him as “representative of all that is best in liberalism, a liberalism with a strong social implication.” He also made a point of Hull’s opposition to isolationism in foreign policy.Let me interrupt to say that we’re talking about Norway, in whose hands Alfred Nobel placed the peace prize. (The other prizes were to be handled in Sweden, Nobel’s native country). Okay, let’s continue:Giving the presentation speeches in 1945 was a new committee chairman, Gunnar Jahn — an economist of the Liberal party, a Resistance leader during the war.I would like to quote a paragraph from the book:Hear, hear. As I read David’s piece, I was reminded of Hull’s peace prize, which I wrote about in a 2012 book, We need Cordell Hulls for our time.Hull was 70 when he spoke those words — old by the standards of his time. Some of the younger New Dealers dismissed him as an anachronism. His ideas about free trade, they said, should be consigned to the dead past, not the exciting new future of national planning and state control. The old man was right, though, and the bright young New Dealers were wrong. Hull’s memory of how things had been proved the opposite of reactionary. Adapted to the new conditions of the postwar world, the old ideas delivered even more abundant prosperity and an even more secure peace than they had before.David then writes,David quotes Hull, who, in the summer of 1942, said the following: “Nationalism, run riot between the last war and this war, defeated all attempts to carry out indispensable measures of international economic and political action, encouraged and facilitated the rise of dictators, and drove the world straight toward the present war.”A few weeks ago, David Frum published a remarkable • Cordell Hull has been on my mind. Strange, I know. Hull, you recall, was the Tennessean who served as FDR’s secretary of state. He held that position for almost the whole of that long presidency. In 1945, Hull won the Nobel Peace Prize, chiefly for fathering the United Nations, which would succeed the tattered League.One more thing: Conservatives like me often mock peace activists. Often, they are mockable. But there are some really good and gutsy ones among them, all over the world. I have met a few. More than a few.

No charge. The more the World Health Organization capitulates to Chinese soft power, the less effective — and the less deserving of our support — it will be. The White House is right to bring serious pressure to bear to try to check this trend.Some argue that withholding our funding of the WHO — $400 million a year — will hinder its international relief efforts. This is a legitimate concern, but the WHO’s missteps themselves hindered the fight against the pandemic at a critical stage. In any event, U.S. funding of pandemic relief does not depend on any single multilateral bureaucracy. In fact, the U.S. has already spent more than $500 million on foreign aid to combat the pandemic — roughly 25 percent of the WHO’s annual budget — on top of existing contributions to multilateral and nongovernmental organizations. During the 60-day hold on funds to the WHO, the White House says it will redirect resources to public-health programs untainted by Chinese influence. While the White House conducts its investigation, the WHO will retain the bulk of its considerable resources. In the meantime, it will deservedly face more international scrutiny for its apparent complicity in China’s coverup of the coronavirus.
Because there are no existing vaccines or proven treatments for COVID-19, information is our most valuable resource in fighting this pandemic. Policymakers must calibrate their responses based on data collected domestically and received from abroad. In its capacity as the facilitator of international information exchanges, the WHO is supposed to vet and disseminate data from its 194 member states. The organization fell down on this most basic task by buying Chinese spin wholesale.Tedros objected to Trump’s correct decision to impose travel restrictions on China, claiming it would “have the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit” — a stark contrast with his deferential statements about China’s response. In mid January, the WHO announced that there was “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus,” despite It’s no secret that the White House got off to a late start in combating the coronavirus. Trump downplayed the threat of the disease even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans to brace for an outbreak, and we criticized him for it. But this obviously doesn’t vindicate the World Health Organization. We noted its failures Critics charge Trump with scapegoating the WHO for the administration’s failures, while others caution that pulling funding will weaken efforts to combat the pandemic. They are wrong on both counts.<span class=""drop"">P</span>

No charge.<em>COPYRIGHT 2020 </em>Standing in line with your neighbors to vote in your local school or church is a civic ritual that ranks with fireworks on the Fourth of July. It’s part of the pageant of patriotism. But this year, we’ll need to make other arrangements. We cannot risk a crisis of political legitimacy on top of everything else we’re saddled with. The slogan for November should be: Mail it in!Voting by mail will require money (Congress already appropriated $400 million in the CARES Act), manpower, and time. States that require an excuse could easily adopt a one-time change to the law permitting COVID-19 to suffice as an excuse for 2020. States can also provide secure drop-off sites for ballots, as well as drive-through options. Extending early voting (generally a terrible idea) makes sense when we are dealing with a new system for 75 percent of voters, and when poll workers likely will be scarcer than usual.So Trump’s worry that a vote-by-mail option would mean “you’d never have another Republican elected in this country again” is misplaced. The Republican secretary of state of Ohio, Frank La Rose, President Trump has thrust a stick into the spokes by suggesting that vote by mail disadvantages Republicans. But there are no data to support that and plenty of evidence to the contrary. For one thing, the voters who would be most wary of in-person voting in the age of COVID-19 are the elderly. In 2016, voters over 65 were more likely to vote than any other age cohort, and they gave 53 percent of their votes to Donald Trump. As Rachel Kleinfeld <span>NOW WATCH: </span>To prevent fraud, states take a number of steps such as signature matching, requiring other identifying information such as the last four digits of the Social Security number, and using barcodes for each ballot. A Fortunately, alternatives to in-person voting are not that difficult to achieve with a little advanced planning. Vote-by-mail is already widespread. In the last election, 25 percent of votes were mailed in. Five states — Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Utah, and Hawaii — already vote almost entirely by mail, and every registered voter receives a ballot at home. Twenty-eight others permit mail-in ballots upon request, and 17 states permit mailed ballots but require an excuse such as travel, out-of-state study, or disability.Except November would be far worse than Wisconsin, because an in-person election held nationwide would throw the legitimacy of the results into doubt. At a time when we are bitterly divided, deeply distrustful, and facing a pandemic and economic depression, a disputed election might be more stress than we can stand.In the midst of coronavirus, we simply cannot conduct elections in the usual way. In-person voting represents a threat to the health of poll volunteers (most of whom are over age 60) and to voters themselves. We cannot ask people to risk their lives to exercise the right to vote. Wisconsin’s recent mess — with thousands disenfranchised because they didn’t receive their mail-in ballots in time and people waiting in lines spaced out by six feet for multiple hours — is a flashing warning light.Well, we are staring at another possible disaster bearing down on us. I refer to the November 3 election. There is still time to act wisely, but not much time.<span class=""drop"">W</span>

No charge.Taiwan not only got it right at the crucial early stages of this virus, it has done a good job suppressing it.<strong>ADDENDUM</strong>This does not mean that SARS-CoV-2 is a biological weapon. What it means is that the Chinese government’s interest in and enthusiasm for researching contagious viruses may not be entirely driven by altruistic reasons.But this is not to say that Chinese government has no interest in biological weapons. China signed the Biological Weapons Convention in 1984, There’s one other wrinkle to keep in mind. Right now, everything we know about the Wuhan Institute of Virology indicates it is a research laboratory that was studying coronaviruses in the name of health research. The original SARS outbreak in 2002-2003 had more than 5,300 cases in China and killed 349 people. It is entirely natural and expected that Chinese health officials and doctors would want to know more about coronaviruses, to be prepared to fight some future outbreak.In addition to the U.S. and China, BSL-4 laboratories operate in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Gabon, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.A few years ago, the Chinese government announced plans to “We know, We know that back in 2014, scientists like Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and biodefence expert at Rutgers University, <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/did-we-see-this-coming/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">But back in 2014, the U.S. government started getting worried about certain kinds of research</a>This current pandemic means the world will never stop researching coronaviruses; the need to understand them better, and how to combat them once they’re in a human body, is too great.In a strange way, the “lab accident” scenario is one of the most reassuring explanations. It means that if we want to ensure we never experience this again, we simply need to get every lab in the world working on contagious viruses to ensure 100 percent compliance with safety protocols, all the time. You might contend that that sort of thing is impossible, but we’ve never had an accidental launch of a nuclear weapon. It is probably easier to get every scientist working on contagious diseases in the world to always follow the safety rules, than to get every farmer in the world to stop using guano as fertilizer, or to hunt down every exotic animal smuggler in the world.<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=16647731&amp;dopt=Abstract"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Scientists have known that bats carry a wide variety of coronaviruses since at least 2006.</a><a href=""https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/8/13-0119_article?s_cid=eid-gDev-email"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Bat guano is used as fertilizer in many countries,</a>The Chinese government is incredibly reckless and unconcerned about the risk to human life because they keep the wet markets open. Put another way, right now in your community, you’ve got to stand in line six feet apart to get into your local supermarket, but Beijing won’t even shut down the exotic animal butchers.As of this writing, this virus has infected 2 million people and killed more than 135,000. If wet markets are the source of the virus, humanity is every bit as vulnerable to a new strain of the coronavirus today as we were with the first patient, back in November or December.Chinese state-run media If it originated from a person eating bat or pangolin at a wet market, then we need to take steps to ensure that bat and pangolin consumption and trade stops everywhere in the world. (This would probably be a good idea even if the virus The irony is that But if we want to ensure nothing like this happens again, we need to know how this virus first got into humans.A few people sometimes ask whether it really matters whether this virus originated from someone being less careful than they needed to be with a bat in a laboratory or biological material from the bats. I assume these are good faith questions, and not some sort of effort to preserve the good name of the Chinese government. Indeed, to the doctors trying to save lives right now, and to those suffering the effects of SARS-CoV-2 right now, the scenario that brought the virus into humans doesn’t matter that much, at least at this moment.And when there is an outbreak of a novel coronavirus that originated in bats in Wuhan, China, people understandably start to wonder if it has anything to do with the two laboratories in the city that were doing research on novel coronaviruses in bats.If someday there is an outbreak of a new, strange, and deadly virus in the Cumberland area of northwest Atlanta, people will understandably wonder if the virus first manifesting there had anything to do with the fact that the headquarters of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is nearby. If someday there is an outbreak of a new, strange, and deadly virus in Frederick, Md., people will understandably wonder if the outbreak has anything to do with the nearby U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick.China “100 percent” suppressed data and changed data, the sources tell Fox News. Samples were destroyed, contaminated areas scrubbed, some early reports erased, and academic articles stifled.Documents detail early efforts by doctors at the lab and early efforts at containment. The Wuhan wet market initially identified as a possible point of origin never sold bats, and the sources tell Fox News that blaming the wet market was an effort by China to deflect blame from the laboratory, along with the country’s propaganda efforts targeting the U.S. and Italy . . .What all of the sources agree about is the extensive cover-up of data and information about COVID-19 launched by the Chinese government.The “increasing confidence” comes from classified and open-source documents and evidence, the sources said. Fox News has requested to see the evidence directly. Sources emphasized — as is often the case with intelligence — that it’s not definitive and should not be characterized as such. Some inside the administration and the intelligence and epidemiological communities are more skeptical, and the investigation is continuing.The sources believe the initial transmission of the virus was bat-to-human, and that “patient zero” worked at the laboratory, then went into the population in Wuhan.This may be the “costliest government coverup of all time,” one of the sources said.There is increasing confidence that COVID-19 likely originated in a Wuhan laboratory, though not as a bioweapon but as part of China’s effort to demonstrate that its efforts to identify and combat viruses are equal to or greater than the capabilities of the United States, multiple sources who have been briefed on the details of early actions by China’s government and seen relevant materials tell Fox News.But you can feel the ground shifting underneath your feet:I can’t quite spike the football yet; I wish <strong>Fox News: ‘Increasing Confidence that COVID-19 Likely Originated in a Wuhan Laboratory’</strong>On the menu today: one long deep dive into the Fox News report that unnamed “sources” are increasingly confident that the origin of this virus is an accidental release or infection from a laboratory, and how National ReviewFollow Us",0,It

No charge.Meanwhile, judges like Thompson across the country rule that even a global pandemic is not reason enough to give states greater leeway in temporarily limiting access to abortion, among many other non-essential procedures (which, unlike abortion, aim at health rather than at death). While a few courts have sided with states on this matter in recent weeks, most have not, proving once again that under U.S. jurisprudence, there are few things more sacred than the manufactured constitutional right to abortion.In response to the decision, ACLU attorney Alexa Kolbi-Molinas said, “Preventing someone from getting an abortion doesn’t do anything to stop the COVID-19 virus, it just takes the decision whether to have a child out of their hands.” Here Kolbi-Molinas employs a sleight of hand beloved by abortion defenders. A woman who gets an abortion “Based on the current record, the defendants’ efforts to combat COVID-19 do not outweigh the lasting harm imposed by the denial of an individual’s right to terminate her pregnancy, by an undue burden or increase in risk on patients imposed by a delayed procedure, or by the cloud of unwarranted prosecution against providers,” Thompson wrote.Uninterested in this rationale, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the state on behalf of an abortionist in Alabama, and this past Sunday, U.S. district judge Myron Thompson ruled against the order.The state’s argument in favor of the policy was similar to those presented in other states where similar orders were put in place: Limiting health-care procedures to emergencies lowers the number of instances in which COVID-19 could spread and preserves scarce medical equipment for health-care professionals dealing with the current crisis.Alabama’s Republican governor Kay Ivey issued the order in mid March and it is slated to last until April 30. Contrary to what opponents claim, the policy had to do with far more than restricting abortion. It required that all health-care professionals in Alabama delay any medical procedures other than those related to health emergencies or that were needed to “avoid serious harm from an underlying condition or disease, or necessary as part of a patient’s ongoing and active treatment.”Over the weekend, a federal judge sided with abortion providers and granted a preliminary injunction to block an emergency order in Alabama that attempted to delay abortion procedures until the COVID-19 pandemic has died down.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Judge Prevents Alabama from Limiting Abortion during COVID-19 Crisis

My math was off by a factor as ten, which means as much as everyone is contending it was far too pessimistic, the first version was way too optimistic.This doesn’t mean, “Don’t open up the economy until we have a vaccine.” It means, if we decide to go down this path, we should go in understanding that the road to herd immunity will probably be long, slow, and painful.And remember, each person’s immunity could only last ten months or so.One half of one percent of 132 million people would be . . . 660,000 people dying along the way to herd immunity. Now let’s look at the worst-case scenario. If herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2 needs 95 percent of the population to have antibodies or be immune, like with the measles, that means about 313 million Americans would need to catch the virus. One half of one percent of 313 million people would be . . . 1.5 million Americans dying along the way to herd immunity.Let’s assume achieving herd immunity requires that minimal threshold for contagious diseases, 40 percent. The U.S. population is 330 million people. That means the minimum threshold for herd immunity is for 132 million people to catch the virus. Let’s also assume the current death rate in the U.S. overstates this by a factor of ten, and that the death rate would be one half of one percent.The As many people like to note, we’re making educated guesses as to the fatality rate, because we’re undercounting cases — both asymptomatic individuals and those whose symptoms are so mild, they’re not going to a doctor to get diagnosed — and we’re probably undercounting deaths, too. (Then again, (3) If opening up the economy, even partially, means that inevitably more people will get infected — herd immunity (2) (1) But there are some giant life-and-death questions about herd immunity that need to be answered.Because we’re still probably a year to 18 months away from a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, a lot of people are trying to figure out how the United States and other countries can reach “herd immunity” — which is what happens when enough members of a population have antibodies to a contagious disease that it can no longer easily spread from one person to another.I’m as eager to see the economy start to reopen as the next guy.  As noted in yesterday’s Morning Jolt, National ReviewFollow Us",0,"The Road to Herd Immunity Will Be Long, Slow, and Painful"

No charge.Labyrinthine regulations and staunch NIMBYism that has made housing prices prohibitive, opposition to enforcing quality-of-life laws that might preserve order on the streets, persistent activism against attempts to commit mentally ill people living on the street to institutions, and an attitude toward public services that amounts to throwing more money at the problem every election year and trying to ignore the people huddled in subway stations and in doorways: The status quo has been intolerable, but tolerated, for a long time. It remains to be seen whether the current pandemic will test that.But there is much we have known for years: that homelessness is a human disaster and a public-health Urban homelessness was a crisis for years before the pandemic, and the spread of coronavirus threatens to make it even more widespread and even less safe. There is still so much we don’t know about what the coming years will bring for cities: How much will homeless populations grow? Will they be spread throughout the country or will they congregate, as they do now, in cities where services are clustered? What toll will the disease take from the homeless? How much will aid providers, already stretched by a lack of supplies and volunteers, be overwhelmed by demand and inevitable budget cuts? As Roman put it, even if we safely house the entire existing homeless population, we risk “replacing one [homeless] population with another.”But homelessness policymakers may soon be dealing with problems that go far beyond immediate health concerns. While Eide and Roman both confirmed that there does not seem to be an immediate rise in homelessness, due mostly to governments banning rent evictions, they also both agreed that this pause is temporary. The recession caused by the outbreak threatens to be the worst since the Great Depression, and while homelessness has a myriad of causes, from crime to mental illness to drug addiction, missing rent checks or losing jobs due to recession will inevitably lead to the loss of housing for some.
However, there has not yet been the predicted catastrophe among shelters and encampments, aside from a few well-publicized cases. This could be the result of poor testing as much as anything else, especially among the street population, who certainly remain vulnerable while the virus continues to circulate.But sleeping bags and tents still dot the sidewalks, and there is even anecdotal reporting of encampments growing Of course, large and extremely unsanitary tent encampments are far from safe. Nan Roman, the president and CEO of the Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonpartisan policy organization, stressed in an interview that the health risks were still very serious for those living on the street, and noted that while the CDC has not directed governments to clear encampments, “they certainly haven’t indicated that people should stay on the street.”The danger certainly hasn’t gone unnoticed by local and state officials. Stephen Eide, a policy analyst at the Manhattan Institute, says that the general expectation has been that “every place that has a lot of homeless people will be hit very hard.” Governors and mayors have announced Ever since the start of the outbreak in the United States, policymakers and advocates had been warning of the risk that coronavirus could spread rapidly among the country’s large homeless population, many of whom are concentrated in urban centers, especially in the West. Many factors place the homeless at far more <span class=""drop"">L</span>

No charge.It was on Monday that the Justice Department filed its statement of interest, intervening on the church’s behalf. By Tuesday, the city had caved on its overwrought prohibition. This is a welcome sign. As recounted in my Here, there is no doubt that city officials, like the state and federal governments, have a compelling interest in protecting the public by ordering measures reasonably calculated to prevent the spread of infectious disease. Still, the complete prohibition of communal religious services is not the least restrictive alternative. As the church illustrates, the communal services are honoring social-distancing mandates. As such, they pose no realistic threat. Indeed, they are less threatening than many activities the city permits under the social-distancing regime, to say nothing of the threat the police caused in breaking up the religious service.Moreover, Mississippi’s RFRA (like the federal RFRA, which does not apply to the states) requires that if state action is imposing a burden on religion, the action is illegal unless the state can demonstrate (a) a compelling governmental interest and (b) that the regulatory action is the “least restrictive means” of furthering that interest.This unequal treatment of the church offends the Constitution.Here, patently, the city of Greenville has been discriminating against religious institutions. The most blatant example, cited by the Justice Department’s submission, is the comparison between churches and restaurants. Both are considered “essential” and ostensibly permitted to operate as such. Yet the city permits food delivery by drive-through service, where drivers roll down their car windows and transact in close quarters with restaurant staff. By contrast, the city is forbidding communal religious rites, during which people remain in their cars with the windows rolled up, distant from one another.That said, laws are not neutral and generally applicable if they are enforced in a manner that discriminates against religion.  
     
   Like all rights, the right to free exercise of religion is not absolute. The Supreme Court has held that religious believers are subject to “neutral, generally applicable laws” — i.e., laws that do not evince hostility to religion and that apply to everyone. As a rule, this must be the case, lest every person became a law unto himself or herself — avoiding society’s laws simply by citing religious beliefs, whether or not sincerely held.The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division argued that the church appears to be correct on both grounds. Under federal law, though not a party to the lawsuit, DOJ was authorized to intervene in order to further the federal government’s interests. These include preventing law-enforcement officials from engaging in a pattern or practice that deprives individuals of their lawful rights.The church thus filed its lawsuit in Mississippi federal district court, claiming violations of the members’ federal constitutional right to free exercise of religion and their right, under the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), to be free of undue burdens on religious practices.Nevertheless, on April 8, the city of Greenville dispatched eight of its uniformed officers to disrupt a service and disperse the church members. In truth, there was no threat or violation of social-distancing protocols until the police arrived. The officers knocked on the car windows, ordering attendees to roll them down. The police spoke with the occupants of the vehicles, demanded driver’s licenses, and wrote citations with $500 fines.Mississippi’s COVID-19 protocols acknowledge that religious institutions are “essential” services. They are thus permitted to operate with significant restrictions, as are other essential services, such as restaurants. These restrictions include social-distancing mandates. Seeking to conduct regular services while adhering to the mandates, the Temple Baptist Church organized drive-in services. Those attending, in the church parking lot, had to remain in their cars with the windows rolled up. The cars were parked farther apart than the six-foot social-distancing standard for people outside their cars. The services were then broadcast over a low-power FM radio station. The church does not have a website or the ability to stream services online; and in any event, many church members lack social-media accounts and other online amenities.DOJ has followed through.Recall that Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec Moreover, the federal government is now encouraging the courts to act, to defend our liberties. In crises past, involving physical and forcible threats of instantaneous mass casualties, all levels of government have generally unified on the side of security. But here, in the absence of such threats, the Justice Department is taking the position that constitutional liberties do not forfeit their exalted status. Governmental protective actions must reasonably accommodate our freedoms.
In part, this is because the virus, though serious and potentially lethal, is very different from terrorist attacks, the outbreak of violent insurrection, and even natural catastrophes such as earthquakes or tsunamis. COVID-19 poses no threat of instantaneous mass casualties. The virus is a slow-motion threat. The vast majority of Americans are not infected, and only a very small percentage of those infected are dying. There is no cause for martial law. The courts are open and functioning. There is a temporary scale-back in judicial operations, but judges are available to hear and rule on emergent constitutional violations.The coronavirus epidemic is proving to be an exception to this pattern.The case is a significant one, given the ongoing tension between (a) governmental restrictions to avoid the spread of COVID-19 and (b) individual liberties vouchsafed by our fundamental law, such as the freedoms to travel, associate with others, and exercise one’s religion.

   Bennett is a famous pro-lifer who sincerely wants to protect the vulnerable unborn. It seems to me the vulnerable born deserve adequate protection too, and the sacrifices Americans are making in that effort aren’t fueled by panic or cowardice, but by heroism.More importantly, the idea that Americans are panicky fraidy-cats strikes me as grossly unfair. Where is the evidence? I see it nowhere in my daily life or in the inspiring stories of courageous health workers and generous citizens. Nor is there much evidence of it in polls, which show overwhelming support for social-distancing policies.That phrase comes from historian Richard Hofstadter, and Bennett mangles its meaning. The “paranoid style” in Hofstadter’s telling, is the populist tendency to see elites treasonously conspiring against the common good. Bennett doesn’t ascribe sinister motives to public-health “experts” — the scare quotes are his — but his insistence that they aren’t to be trusted lends aid and comfort to the kind of conspiracy-mongering Hofstadter had in mind. Indeed, Bennett’s odd refusal to place any blame on Donald Trump for the policies of his administration only fuels the idea that the president is being misled by sinister forces — something one hears constantly from certain quarters of the right.What bothers me more about Bennett’s argument isn’t his mischievous epidemiological speculation but his theory of why the country is responding to the pandemic the way it is. He argues on TV and in writing that America has been frightened into an unnecessary overreaction by the media and the Left. He wants Americans to man up and respond with the sort of courage we showed after the 9/11 attacks, rather than giving in to the “paranoid style in American politics.”To be fair, Bennett doesn’t propose that we should have done nothing. He suggests we should have just protected the vulnerable population and kept the economy going. I share his concern about the economy, but Sweden has tried something similar, and its death toll is soaring, and its economy is crashing, anyway.<em>The New Atlantis</em>Over the 87 days from the announcement of the first U.S. case to this writing on April 16, COVID-19 has killed, on average, 391 Americans per day. If you annualized that you’d get 142,644 deaths, more than double the estimated 61,000 people who died from the flu during the 2017–2018 flu season that Bennett cited. But again, that’s misleading, because if left unchecked, the rate of COVID-19 infection would be exponential.Here’s the first problem: These projections of COVID-19 deaths take into account the social-distancing practices we’ve enacted — and they curb the rate of new infections. If we hadn’t started taking precautions, those estimates would be (and were) vastly higher. Thus, Bennett botches the concept of causality. It’s like yelling at firemen for all the water damage to your house since all that burned up was a tiny part of your kitchen, without acknowledging that if the firefighters hadn’t shown up, the whole house would have burned down.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Bennett’s primary “fact” is that current projections hold that roughly 60,000 Americans will die from COVID-19 (though he thinks it will be less than that). “We’re going to have fewer fatalities from this than from the flu,” he said. “For this, we scared the hell out of the American people” and wrecked the economy.The upshot of Bennett’s position is that the COVID-19 threat has been wildly exaggerated from the outset. Contrary to every dictionary I can find, he says COVID-19 is not a pandemic, “but we do have panic and pandemonium as a result of the hype of this. And it’s really unfortunate. Look at the facts.”My long-time friend Bill Bennett, the former secretary of education, recently appeared on Fox News (where we are both contributors) to “put the data in perspective,” as one of the hosts put it.COVID-19 is killing a lot of people. From the announcement of the first confirmed U.S. case on January 20 to April 16, it has killed nearly 34,000 Americans. (I’ll ignore claims that number is inflated as well as more persuasive arguments that it’s an undercount.)<span class=""drop"">L</span>

But both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been widely used for decades, and most doctors are well acquainted with their side effects. Indeed, Americans with lupus and other autoimmune problems have been taking hydroxychloroquine and dealing with the same side effects for decades, too.

But we also need to make sure that those lives we’re saving still have an actual life to live.In a world where every American had near-unlimited financial resources and the psychological stamina to remain in their homes indefinitely, we could keep the quarantines going for two months or three or as long as it was needed to beat this virus. But we don’t live in that world. Americans need to get out of their houses, they need to get back to work, they need to be able to shop for something besides groceries and medication, and they need to be able to interact with each other — even if it’s while wearing masks and standing six feet apart. They need to be able to go to the parks and beaches and lakes, and to soak up that sunlight. They need to be able to get into restaurants and sit in small groups while spread apart.Most of the country is in its fifth week of the coronavirus-driven shutdown and self-quarantining. Colleges and universities started moving to online classes March 10. The following day, Washington and Ohio put limits on large gatherings, the NBA suspended the season that night, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson announced they tested positive, and President Trump gave his Oval Office address. Public schools started closing in twelve states on March 12, and for kids in Virginia, that was the last day of attending school for the school year. By Monday, March 16, the federal government issued new guidelines urging people to avoid social gatherings of more than ten people and to restrict discretionary travel.The city of Los Angeles shut down for We may not be quite at the limit of American patience for the lockdowns, but we are not that far away from it.<a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/vitamin-d-and-coronavirus-disparities-11587078141"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Also note that new research indicates that lower levels of Vitamin D may increase vulnerability to the coronavirus.</a>Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer’s If governors want people to limit how much they leave their homes, they must suppress their Because an end to the lockdowns must arrive, and it must arrive probably in a matter of weeks. New York governor Cuomo <strong>This Is Not a Time for Governor Eric Cartman</strong>That’s a terrific example of American optimism, determination, and a faith that with enough ingenuity, some “winning” solution can be discovered. And who knows, maybe later today some scientist will have a “eureka!” moment and discover a vaccine. But until that happens, we have to deal with the situation as it is. We can choose the path of continued lockdowns that absolutely crush our economy and will eventually lead to bad health problems of their own — depression, alcoholism, drug abuse, suicides. Or we can choose the path of reopening the economy and inevitably an increase in exposure, more infections, and more deaths.I think a lot of Americans on both sides of the aisle — and particularly a chunk of the apolitical — believe that there has to be some “good” solution to this problem, and that someone who is sufficiently smart or wise would find one. I think they are psychologically unprepared for a situation where there are no good solutions, only varying degrees of bad — a no-win situation. It says something about American society that one of the most popular tales of When you lay out these numbers, a lot of people jump to the conclusion that this is an argument for keeping everyone in America locked up indefinitely. It is not. I just want everyone to know what we are in for as we take steps to reopen the economy.There’s one other reason I don’t think a large percentage of Americans are walking around infected and asymptomatically. New York City looks like the clearest example of what happens when this virus spreads in an unprepared population.If we’re detecting one out of every 20 cases, that means about 13 million Americans have the virus or had it and fought it off. Applying the current death total to that sum suggests a death rate between two-tenths of one percent and three-tenths of one percent.As of this morning, the United States has 678,210 confirmed cases. If our testing is only detecting one out of every ten Americans who have it, then 6.7 million Americans either have the virus or had it and fought it off. If you take our current total of 34,641 deaths and divide that into our suspected total of 6.7 million cases — remember, some who are currently testing positive will die — it comes out to a death rate of one half of one percent.Robert also notes that one percent of the population of the state of New York has been diagnosed positive, so unless everyone in the state of New York has it, we are not failing to detect 99 out of 100 cases. He looks at a variety of studies and thinks our limited ability to test the public means we are probably detecting one out of ten or one out of 20 cases.Also please read In all of these cases, I’ve assumed a death rate of one half of one percent. I keep hearing people insisting, “We don’t know how many people have the virus, so the death rate numbers are meaningless.” But The actual infection rate required is probably closer to the worst-case scenario than the best-case one. A I have a sneaking feeling that a certain number of people who are touting “herd immunity” have only the vaguest sense of how difficult achieving that goal will be. <strong>We’re Going to Have to Choose Between Two Bad Options</strong>Better treatments should mean a better survival rate, which should make the consequences of a gradual reopening the economy less dire. The debate about this huge decision in the last several days has been extraordinarily frustrating. The “reopen the economy” side is accused of being callous and selfish, and the “keep people home” side is accused of being blithe about economic catastrophe.As for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, the drugs that somehow turned into a partisan football because President Trump touted them, “Once you see it work, you want to do it more, and you see it work almost immediately,” added Dr. Kathryn Hibbert, director of the medical ICU at Massachusetts General Hospital.Narasimhan, the regional director for critical care at Northwell Health, which owns 23 hospitals in New York. “It’s such a simple thing to do, and we’ve seen remarkable improvement. We can see it for every single patient.”“We’re saving lives with this, one hundred percent,” said Dr. MangalaDoctors are finding that placing the sickest coronavirus patients on their stomachs — called prone positioning — helps increase the amount of oxygen that’s getting to their lungs.There’s another extraordinarily simple treatment that is generating great results, at least in some patients: “The best news is that most of our patients have already been discharged, which is great. We’ve only had two patients perish,” said Kathleen Mullane, the University of Chicago infectious disease specialist overseeing the remdesivir studies for the hospital.<a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/16/early-peek-at-data-on-gilead-coronavirus-drug-suggests-patients-are-responding-to-treatment/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">It’s early, but remdesivir might be a really effective treatment for COVID-19.</a>Everyone prefers the good news, so let’s start with that.<strong>Hurrah!

On Tuesday, the ECB’s The Frugal Four have opposed such bonds, and still do. They regard them as a major step along the road to a fiscal union in which four countries risk footing some of the bill for their more feckless fellows — forever. In an attempt to make the idea more acceptable to the careful quartet, some of its advocates are relabeling euro bonds as “corona bonds,” a name intended both to tug the heartstrings and to convey the idea that they will be a one-off — a hard task given that the EU’s integration process lacks a reverse gear and has, at best, ineffective brakes.For years now, those who want to take the currency union closer to a fiscal union — a move that might make a degree of economic sense but would trash yet more of what remains of national democracy within the euro zone — have pushed for “Under the circumstances, the only question is not whether the Frugal Four will capitulate but when and how. The when will probably be the point at which the spike in Italian interest rates fuels a panic, and the how is more than likely to be “And if Italy is driven to go one step further — pull out of the euro altogether — the default will be bigger, and so will its reverberations elsewhere, amplified by capital flight as investors in the remaining euro-zone countries wonder which would be the next to leave.The idea that the effects of the most likely alternative — a default, but with the country staying within the euro — could safely be kept within Italy’s borders is nonsense. A default would also trigger the collapse of much of the Italian banking system (Italian banks hold alarmingly large amounts of their government’s debt), and the dominoes would tumble across the continent. To start with, according to a Nevertheless, none of this is going to make the debt go away. Italy’s debt-to-GDP ratio now stands at around 135 percent, and with GDP falling and debt rising, it is easy to anticipate this ratio rising to 150 percent or beyond. It is debt that Italy, which no longer has its own currency, can neither print nor devalue away, and it is debt that the country — in and out of recession since signing up for the euro — is going to struggle to pay, particularly if Italy’s borrowing costs start — as they may well do — to rise significantly. The notion that Rome would agree to budget-cutting to the extent needed — if that’s The euro zone has bought itself time with last week’s agreement and, even more so, by what the ECB is doing, and will continue to do, very possibly on a yet greater scale (something that might involve reaching for an unused weapon in its arsenal — “And so, confronted with the prospect that Italy — the bloc’s third-largest economy — might go into default, let alone the danger that it could quit the currency union, the Frugal Four will blink yet again. The Dutch have already conceded that the “Greece could be pushed around. It was a small country, with a small economy. It could be ordered to starve itself healthy and it could be made to wait for help. However, facing the possibility that this tiny reprobate might be forced out of the currency union (or even go into default within it), the “north,” fearful of what a demonstration that the euro was not, after all, “irreversible” might mean, blinked. And not just once.In 2018, after Greece was given yet more relief by its creditors, the

Trapped somewhere in the long run, Keynes’s ghost screamed.Greece’s 2009 budget deficit ended up at over In Helpful promises tend to evaporate when faced with unhelpful events; this one did not survive the euro-zone crisis a little over ten years later.In “According to the treaty rules, the euro community shall not be liable for the commitments of its member states, and there will be no additional financial transfers.”Greece’s economic agony over the last decade gives some insights as to how this will play out. The underlying issue, after all, is the same. The euro zone’s more financially responsible members do not want to pick up the tab for those they see as irredeemably spendthrift. Back in 1998, German chancellor Helmut Kohl, keenly aware of the reluctance of his fellow countrymen to replace their trusted deutschmark with a speculative single currency, told the German parliament this:Given that €540 billion will probably not be enough, and that “European solidarity” is understood in very different ways across the currency union, the current pause in the drama will likely be no more than an intermission. The next act will probably be centered on Italy and, perhaps, Spain. If history is any guide, it will end in some kind of surrender by the “Frugal Four” (Germany, Austria, Finland, and the Netherlands), who are — for entirely understandable reasons — holding the line against a proposed next stage: an issuance of pooled euro-zone debt.Oh.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>“These proposals build on our collective financial strength and European solidarity.”Fine words, although not made more reassuring by their coda:<a href=""https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/04/09/remarks-by-mario-centeno-following-the-eurogroup-videoconference-of-9-april-2020/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">These</a><a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/09/831395411/eu-finance-ministers-reach-590-billion-coronavirus-rescue-deal"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Essentially</a>At the end of last week, and after the now traditional <span class=""drop"">I</span>

					© 2020 National Review				Please choose a reason below:Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.Please choose a reason below:NPR ran a strange piece casting these rival predictions as matters of fact also: “FACT CHECK: N.Y. Governor Slams Trump Ventilator Claim As ‘Ignorant’ And ‘Uninformed.’” Well, yes, it’s a fact that the governor expressed those opinions, but NPR doesn’t ordinarily fact-check opinions. NPR couldn’t fact-check the future in this “FACT CHECK,” and didn’t. The ventilator shortages of which we were all gravely warned have not yet come to pass. If we have indeed reached the crest of the crisis, perhaps they won’t.Three weeks ago, President Trump was mocked and ridiculed for downplaying the need for more ventilators. “I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they’re going to be,” Trump said on March 27. “I don’t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,” he added, referring to Cuomo’s estimate for New York state. Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and others said they had “facts” on their side. Said De Blasio, “When the president says the state of New York doesn’t need 30,000 ventilators, with all due respect to him, he’s not looking at the facts of this astronomical growth of this crisis. And a ventilator . . . means someone lives or dies.”<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Maryland, which was sent 50 ventilators by California recently before Cuomo offered to send them 50 more, appears to be right around its apex; deaths hit a record high of 47 on April 15, then dropped slightly each of the next two days. I couldn’t find any stats about ventilators on the state’s COVID-19 website. The state’s largest paper, the Michigan, the fifth-hardest-hit state after Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, may or may not have had its worst day. So far its worst daily death toll was 205 on April 10, but its second-highest total was 172 on April 16. The number of new cases reported fell slightly from a peak on April 14. But Michigan isn’t even using most of its ventilators yet: As of April 16, it reported 1,232 ventilators were being used but 1,754 more were available. So New York’s surplus is at the moment adding to the Michigan surplus.New Jersey has by far the most cases outside of New York, with 75,000 positive tests. It also has by far the most deaths outside of New York: 3,518 as of April 16. However, New Jersey, with 8,011 total hospitalizations as of April 16, also Now New York appears to have passed the apex. Deaths, a lagging indicator, crested at 799 on April 9 and hit 606 on April 16, the lowest figure since April 6. Hospitalizations are also declining, and on April 16 also hit their lowest level since April 6. Cuomo today has so many ventilators he is giving them away: On April 15, he said he was sending 100 of them to Michigan and 50 to Maryland. On April 16, he announced he was sending 100 to New Jersey.In the state that (as of today) has one-third of the country’s confirmed COVID-19 cases, New York governor Andrew Cuomo sounded the alarm for ventilators repeatedly. On March 27, he acknowledged “I don’t have a crystal ball” but said his state desperately needed 30,000 ventilators, maybe 40,000, but had only 12,000. When President Trump noted that Cuomo’s state had thousands of unused ventilators it hadn’t even placed yet, Cuomo admitted this was true but said he still needed more: “Yes, they’re in a stockpile because that’s where they’re supposed to be because we don’t need them yet. We need them for the apex,” Cuomo said at the time. On April 2, Cuomo predicted the state would run out of ventilators in six days “at the current burn rate.” But on April 6, Cuomo noted, “We’re ok, and we have some in reserve.”<span class=""drop"">I</span>

But we are distressingly far from being able to competently implement some of these measures. Let’s attack that problem with the ferociousness it demands.Phone apps, meanwhile, may track users’ movements and alert them if they’ve come into contact with someone infected, making it far easier to detect new cases and quarantine them. These apps should be strongly encouraged and incentivized once they are available, even if for privacy reasons they should not be mandated.It may also be possible to clear Americans to work by testing them, or even to roll out a truly massive testing effort to comprehensively track and control the disease’s spread — but only if we have far more tests than we are currently making. We need to light a fire under that process, both by shredding red tape and by providing big incentives to any business that can churn out tests.Other ways of attacking this problem, though, depend on technologies and capacities that do not yet exist. A drug to treat the worst cases of the disease would be a godsend, saving lives and reducing the risks of reopening. At this writing there are highly promising signs regarding remdesivir, but we need to be aggressively testing as many options as we can. A good treatment is our most likely route out of this mess.The administration’s guidelines showcase one way of putting these concepts together. Areas with control over their outbreaks and adequate health-care capacity would start by slowly reopening businesses with strict social-distancing rules in place; then proceed, in Phase II, to more relaxed rules and reopening schools; and conclude with Phase III, in which businesses are back in full swing and even members of vulnerable populations can go out and about with some precautions.Even when businesses and schools do reopen, they should work to keep customers and students separated to the greatest degree practicable. Policymakers should also be mindful of the fact that the disease hits the elderly hard while overwhelmingly sparing children: Continuing to isolate the old while the young return to work and schools reopen will often make sense.Some necessary elements of such a plan are simple, obvious, and easy to achieve. Mask-wearing should be strongly encouraged, perhaps required, in public places where people cannot avoid coming close to each other. Lockdowns should be ended on a gradual schedule, with the least affected areas going first. And hard-hit regions should get their outbreaks under control — with consistently declining case loads, plus the testing and treatment capacity to handle a potential increase — before they reopen.In setting such a policy, errors bring with them immense harms. Lifting the lockdowns without having other control measures in place would likely allow the virus to reassert itself; but extending the lockdowns too far would prompt a backlash (there are already signs of this) and further deepen the severe damage we have done to the economy. Therefore, we must develop alternatives to lockdowns as quickly as possible and implement them carefully.<span class=""drop"">I</span>

Our friends who don’t have kids have fewer distractions from the news of death stalking nursing homes. Some are wrecks from it all, thinking they are watching their country fall apart. We, as parents, may not get regular sleep. But our kids get to watch us soldier through difficulty. And we get to watch them grow up. My youngest is climbing up onto the kitchen table now, giggling and throwing anything we’ve left on it overboard. We’ll probably get around to vacuuming tomorrow. In the meantime, spring is peeking through, and the two older ones are busy naming the bugs, the fox, and the woodpecker that can be seen through our windows.Do the kids know what is happening? They accept it rather easily. Too easily. There is no protest in our house to reopen the economy. My daughter understands that she can’t have a sleepover with friends “until the virus goes away.” She is starting to video-conference with friends. But mostly the children want to play with their toys, watch cartoons, and work us over for their favorite snack foods.  
     
   Although, given how quickly all this was implemented, my guess is that contacting Human Resources to inquire about the availability of that relief is a hazard. They don’t have guidance, likely don’t have systems in place to implement it, probably think you should be grateful to be working from home anyway, and will likely treat you as a potential lawsuit risk just for asking. So I don’t think we will ask or advise anyone else to do so.American government seems to have grasped that there is a dilemma. Part of the CARES Act relief package is dedicated to preserving child-care facilities through the shutdown and providing some relief for families. If you’ve been employed for at least 30 days and belong to a firm of fewer than 500 but more than 50 employees, there may be an additional ten weeks of paid family leave available, at two-thirds of employees’ regular rate of pay, “where an employee is unable to work due to a bona fide need for leave to care for a child whose school or child care provider is closed or unavailable.”My wife and I create ad hoc schedules: snatching 90 minutes to work here or there while the other watches the kids, conducts class, puts them down for a nap, or makes lunch. Weekends are spent trying to catch up on chores and cleanup.For other parents it is much worse. These days, early-intervention development “therapy” is a hot commodity for young boys and girls, with parents trying to gain spots with time-limited occupational and speech therapists. In lockdown, one can’t simply transfer the ball-pits and swings used in occupational therapy to a FaceTime call.But it has costs. The institutions that were part of my children’s lives — their pre-school and school — are now trying to survive virtually. There were days when merely handling the amount of email from the schools felt like a part-time job on top of the part-time job of sudden-onset homeschooling. Were we going through these exertions for our children’s education, or to make teachers and schools feel less useless?The measures of lockdown make sense too. Closing schools was obvious. My three-year-old can’t govern his hands and hygiene like an experienced Japanese business traveler. He and his sister brought home every cough, sniffle, and stomach bug from September through January, infecting everyone in the house. It was just earlier this year, Super Bowl weekend, that one bug passed through all five of us, hitting the last three at various points during the big game.
But at least we have the kids and they are young, and we can convince ourselves that quarantine time is quality time. And at least the trials of New York’s “pause” make some sense to us. There are over a hundred cases of COVID-19 in our small town, and over 2 percent of this county’s population are confirmed infected. Someone on our street’s Facebook group is mourning the COVID death of her best friend. The hospital around the corner from us has set up a tent outside for triage.Just a few weeks ago my wife and I used to have a full-time babysitter coming to the house. We used to have the support of a functioning public-school district and a pre-school. We used to be able to call on more than half a dozen in-laws in the area. For a little relief from each other we could call on any number of friends locally or from our church. Now we are juggling two full-time jobs and three full-time little kids, and the help comes from Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, and our local grocers.That was the scene a few minutes ago. Now I’m trying to finish this piece of writing before my two sons (ages three-and-a-half and one-and-a-half-ish) wake up from their naps. I probably won’t finish it until the middle of the night, long after they’ve gone to bed.In the corner of the room, I’m eating lunch.

The flu kills tens of thousands each year Lastly, as numerous folks pointed out on Twitter throughout the day, New York City now has fatalities totaling more than 0.1 percent of its entire population — 0.1 percent being an important threshold because it’s the fatality rate of the flu.

This resulted in an overrepresentation of white women between the ages of 19 and 64, and an under-representation of Hispanic and Asian populations, relative to our community. Those imbalances were partly addressed by weighting our sample population by zip code, race, and sex to match the county. We did not account for age imbalance in our sample, and could not ascertain representativeness of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in homeless populations. Other biases, such as bias favoring individuals in good health capable of attending our testing sites, or bias favoring those with prior COVID-like illnesses seeking antibody confirmation are also possible. The overall effect of such biases is hard to ascertain.However, there are important limits here. It’s just one county, of course, and the study’s participants were not a random sample of that jurisdiction’s residents:First, <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/04/coronavirus-testing-undercounting-covid-19-cases-likely/"">My piece yesterday</a>National ReviewFollow Us",0,How Many People Already Have COVID-19?

No charge.Unfortunately, the only ways to beat back such intransigence are political: If the public is outraged enough, it must punish Democrats at the ballot box; or congressional Republicans must play the kind of hardball that makes Democrats feel there is too high a price to be paid. Neither of these is very likely — and the latter is in many ways self-defeating. Nevertheless, the president has no legal basis to adjourn Congress and make recess appointments.The president is right that the Democrats’ obstruction has been reprehensible and of historic dimension. From the first, they have proclaimed themselves “The Resistance” and made Trump’s governance as difficult as possible, exalting their political ambition to portray him as illegitimate over the country’s need for a functioning government. They have slowed appointments to a crawl by forcing the Senate to take 144 cloture votes on executive-branch nominations, with all the extended debate and chewing up of Senate session days that this entails. By doing so, Democrats have smashed the traditional bipartisan consensus that the president is entitled to have qualified nominees of his choosing exercising executive power. As the Heritage Foundation’s In addition, while the Framers anticipated that there could be extraordinary circumstances when the president would need to referee an intramural congressional dispute about whether an adjournment has occurred, this power has never been exercised in American history. It is hard to imagine this kind of controversy ever arising; but one thing is certain: The Framers did not put this obscure adjournment provision in the Constitution to facilitate recess appointments. Again, such appointments are irregular — stopgap measures to address a contingency that no longer exists.  
   The problems with the president’s suggestion are obvious. First, there is no disagreement between the two chambers. Unless there were a change by law, the current 116th Congress’s session will end on January 3, 2021. (Under the 20th Amendment, the terms of outgoing Senators and House members end on January 3 of the odd years in which their successors take those seats.) Clearly, there is not going to be any change in the law.  
   In his mini-tirade, President Trump said that if the House did not allow the Senate to adjourn so that he could make recess appointments, he would “exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress.” He was apparently referring to another vestige of the Founding era, Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution. It provides that if both houses of Congress disagree about whether there has been an adjournment of the session, the president “may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper.”The pro forma proceedings mean there can be no claim that a true recess in the session has occurred. They further deprive the president of power to make recess appointments. Recall that President Obama, in his characteristic intolerance of constitutional restraints on executive authority, attempted to make some recess appointments when the Senate was not in recess. At the time, the Senate was conducting pro forma sessions because Republicans then, like Democrats now, were determined to prevent recess appointments. The Supreme Court, in The pro forma procedure is usually used by the Senate. When the Senate takes a break in the middle of a session, as it is doing right now, one senator (often from a state close to Washington, but it can be any senator — all of them live in Washington much of the time) gavels the chamber into session and then promptly gavels out. It takes just a few minutes and no real business is conducted, though the Senate retains the power to conduct business (and has in fact occasionally used the procedure to conduct routine “unanimous consent” business).One of the few requirements the Constitution imposes on congressional procedure is that neither chamber may adjourn for more than three consecutive calendar days without the other’s consent. To avoid this, they conduct “pro forma” proceedings — the proceedings that the president railed against as a “sham” during a coronavirus press conference earlier this week.As for recesses, Congress is not in recess unless it says it is in recess. The Constitution gives both houses of Congress broad authority to make their own rules.
The Framers sagely intended the Senate’s advice-and-consent power to be a check on the president’s power to appoint federal officers and appoint judges to life-tenured seats on the bench. It is a terrible development that appointments have become so politicized, but the check is still necessary to assure that important jobs are filled by competent, scrupulous nominees. The Constitution’s recess-appointment clause (Article II, Section 2) was not meant to be the exception that swallows the rule. In an era when convening Congress quickly was impractical, it was meant to give the president authority to fill slots temporarily between congressional sessions. That is why recess appointments last only through the end of the congressional session that follows the appointment.To take the latter first, it is not 1787 anymore. Modern transportation technology makes it easy to convene Congress if there is some emergency reason to do so. Modern communications technology may soon usher in remote congressional sessions, in which senators and House members debate and vote from wherever they are situated outside of Washington — something that was seriously proposed when the coronavirus hit Capitol Hill a few weeks back. In short, we are no longer in an era when (a) Congress is not in session for months on end, (b) it is challenging to assemble lawmakers in Washington to conduct emergency business, and (c) the president has to have some way to fill key posts during a sudden crisis.Hopefully, though, the president was just blowing off steam earlier this week when he threatened to force an adjournment of Congress in order to enable recess appointments, by which he might temporarily install executive officers and federal judges. Realistically, the president has no power to force Congress to adjourn — it is up to the Senate to decide whether it is in session. The Constitution’s recess-appointment provision, moreover, is an anachronism that should be treated as a nullity.To be sure, this is not the exclusive reason why there are vacancies in key executive-branch slots, including in posts relevant to the government’s COVID-19 response. The administration has been slow in making nominations to some positions (when asked about this, the president says it is an intentional strategy to shrink bloated government). Trump can be very difficult to work for. And the baseless investigations of the administration have made it challenging to recruit high-caliber people — such people always have other options, and even the most public-spirited people would rather avoid situations where the need to retain counsel comes with the territory.<span class=""drop"">E</span>

In the meanwhile, we pray he rests in peace — along with all the many others stricken down by this beast, and other illnesses, and that God protects those left behind. May they all, and we all of us, meet again, or even for the first time, one joyful day in the Paradise promised to even the Good Thief.The pastor called Your Insipid Correspondent, who has fooled parishioners into believing he can carry a tune and even a hymn.

Ron Hansen. Once again, he went 0-for-4 in a Washington Senators last game.The league It was to be the last game played in Washington, or anywhere, by the original Senators: Later that month, the American League approved the franchise’s move to Minneapolis, where the old Senators became the new Twins.Hansen came up in the late 1950s with the Baltimore Orioles, and in 1960, his first full season, he played in both All Star games and won the AL Rookie of the Year award, hitting .252 and smacking 22 home runs while driving in 86 runs. The Os finished in second place — the first time since 1944 when the franchise (then the beloved St. Louis Browns) had a first-division finish — trailing the Yankees by 8 games. The team’s final series was played down the road in Washington, at aging Griffith Stadium against the fifth-place Senators, and in the season’s last game, Twice.He was the quintessential 1960s American League shortstop, but what proves of particular interest to This Scribbler is that <strong>Baseballery</strong>This current essay is in the line of those previous ones—a howl against the wind. First, the founding fathers, it should be remembered, argued quite clearly for commerce with all, but entangling alliances with none. Washington and Jefferson each said this repeatedly and clearly. And, even the most cursory glance at and over the great documents of the Founding—the Declaration of Independence, the Northwest Ordinance, and the Constitution of 1787—were never created for imperialism. Indeed, given the Indian Wars and the American Civil War, it’s not even clear they were made for frontier expansion, at least in the time frame in which such expansion occurred.Still, I want to proclaim these things yet again, whether conservatism listens or not.Two years ago, I published an essay here on the “maliciousness” of progressive-era imperialism. A little over a year before that, I published an essay attempting to “restore the foreign policy of the Founding Fathers.” As desirous as I am of reminding our world of the goals and significances of the American republic, I fear I’ve had absolutely no influence on modern conservatism. Probably there will be no great weeping over Birzer’s inability to play prophet, but such is life (and, yes; no worries, I’m quite aware of my limitations).Let me begin this essay by simply throwing down the gauntlet. American imperialists—of whatever political persuasion or ideology—are not only traitors to the American cause and in violation of the deepest meanings and profundities of the American ideal, they are also embracing demonic goals of remaking the world in their own image, thus trampling on the dignity of the human person. Phew.6. At Around the same time that Burnham’s “Lenin’s Heir” appeared in Trotsky, Burnham noted, believed that he, not Stalin, was Lenin’s true heir. Burnham ridiculed that notion. Stalin was Lenin’s heir. “There is nothing basic that Stalin has done,” Burnham explained, “. . . from the institution of terror as the primary foundation of the state to the assertion of a political monopoly, the seeds and even the shoots of which were not planted and flourishing under Lenin.” “Stalin,” Burnham concluded, “is Lenin’s heir. Stalinism is communism.” This was the “indispensible truth” for the West to understand as it approached the postwar world.Stalin’s moves were not defensive, as many then and since have claimed. Instead, Burnham claimed, they fit within his “geopolitical vision.” That vision, Burnham explained, corresponded to geopolitical concepts first developed by Britain’s Halford Mackinder. “Starting from the magnetic core of the Eurasian heartland,” Burnham wrote, “the Soviet power . . . flows outward, west into Europe, south into the Near East, east into China, . . . lapping the shores of the Atlantic, the Yellow and China Seas, the Mediterranean, and the Persian Gulf.” Stalin, Burnham wrote, has absorbed the Baltics and Poland, dominated Finland, the Balkans, and northern China, spread communist influence in Italy, France, Turkey, Iran, and the rest of China, and sought to infiltrate England and the United States. Moreover, Stalin’s goal is not to destroy nationalism where Soviet forces conquer, but instead to fuse nationalism within the communist movement worldwide.5. At Not so, suggests McCloskey. And, actually, the substance of McCloskey’s response is obvious. Yet I recall few other authors taking the point seriously enough to respond to it. Given the incessant repetition of the criticism among post- and anti-liberals, and how very incorrect it is, it undoubtedly has been a mistake to let it go largely unanswered. McCloskey remedies that oversight.<em>the oligarchy [to] seduce the masses to consume more and more shoddy goods whose appeal will, indeed, soon pale—causing them to seek to earn more in order to be able to buy a new variant or new seductive novelty.</em>We see variants of this claim repeated endlessly on the left as well as on the post-liberal right. On the Marxian left we get theoretical arguments of the ultimate disequilibrium of market economies. Among left-wing neo-Romantic postliberals, we get criticisms of consumer society and the degradation that capitalism’s growth culture wreaks on both the soul and the environment. Right-wing neo-Romantic postliberals sing pretty much the same song. A notable chapter in Deirdre McCloskey’s 2019 book, 4. At Too often, the need to “avoid panic” serves as a retroactive justification for all manner of official missteps. In late March, as the coronavirus pandemic was climbing toward its crest in New York City, Mayor Bill De Blasio appeared on CNN’s Elite panic frequently brings out another unsavory quirk on the part of some authorities: a tendency to believe the worst about their own citizens. In the midst of the Hurricane Katrina crisis in 2005, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin found time to go on Oprah Winfrey’s show and lament “hooligans killing people, raping people” in the Superdome. Public officials and the media credulously repeated rumors about street violence, snipers shooting at helicopters, and hundreds of bodies piled in the Superdome. These all turned out to be wild exaggerations or falsehoods (arguably tinged by racism). But the stories had an impact: Away from the media’s cameras, a massive rescue effort—made up of freelance volunteers, Coast Guard helicopters, and other first responders—was underway across the city. But city officials, fearing attacks on the rescuers, frequently delayed these operations. They ordered that precious space in boats and helicopters be reserved for armed escorts.As in war, the first casualty in disasters is often the truth. One symptom of elite panic is the belief that too much information, or the wrong kind of information, will send citizens reeling. After the 2011 tsunami knocked out Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, officials gave a series of confusing briefings. To many, they seemed to be downplaying the amount of radiation released in the accident. In the end, the radiation risks turned out to be much lower than feared, resulting in no civilian deaths. But, by then, the traumatized public had lost faith in any official statements. As one team of researchers notes, any “perceived lack of information provision increases public anxiety and distrust.”3. In His long-standing relationship with Beijing might help to explain why the WHO has been so accommodating to China even though the coronavirus pandemic originated in Wuhan. Rather than criticising Beijing for its initial attempts to cover up the outbreak, Dr Tedros instead Like Mr Mugabe, Dr Tedros has enjoyed a good relationship with China’s ruling communist party, and he won election to his current position after receiving Dr Tedros was previously a great admirer of former Rhodesian dictator Robert Mugabe, even appointing him as a goodwill ambassador for the WHO, a decision he was forced to revoke following an international outcry.Much of the blame, moreover, for the WHO’s dire performance during the outbreak is being blamed on 2.

Jim Jam Jumpin’ Jive Jeff Blehar and Scotty Wotty Doo Doo Bertram, we pray got over the disappointment of having been forgotten in this section last week, have the great Cam “Bang-Bang” Edwards as their guest for the new episode of <strong><em>Podcastapalooza</em></strong>Fast-forward to today: The striking thing about the pandemic-induced school shutdown is how little of the response to it had to do with the way we’ve talked about schools for most of the past two decades. In a matter of weeks, coronavirus-fueled closures reminded everyone of all the purposes that schools serve that aren’t captured by test scores. In fact, one of current secretary of education Betsy DeVos’s first, and most popular, moves was to waive the federal requirement for state testing.Bush secretary of education Margaret Spellings memorably defended NCLB as “99.9 percent pure.” This was so even as NCLB’s myopic focus on reading and math scores meant that more than half of the nation’s schools were labeled as “failing”—at a time when most parents continued to give their local schools an “A” or a “B.” Obama secretary of education Arne Duncan similarly insisted, “If we know how much students are gaining each year . . . we will know which teachers and principals are succeeding.” This became so familiar that it was easy to stop noticing how bizarre it was to see public officials labeling schools as “successful” or “failing” without regard to what parents thought, the status of civics or citizenship instruction, or anything other than reading and math scores.And then came 21st-century school reformers, who got so enamored of their push to improve reading and math scores that they often turned neglectful when it came to the social mission of schools. Indeed, after the advent of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) in 2001, math and reading scores often served as the definitive measure of good schools or good teaching.In recent years, the socializing mission of schools has faced a two-pronged assault. First, over the decades, attacks by the Left on norms and the American project have yielded school systems disinclined to set forth a muscular vision of personal or civic responsibility. Law suits have left schools leery of exerting firm discipline. Disputes over everything from Christmas to parenting have left educators defensive and prone to political correctness. And critiques of America’s “racist” past have left schools loath to teach history or civics in ways that might appear unduly prideful or patriotic.4. Frederick Hess finds the pandemic presents the opportunity to consider the virtues and flaws of public education. The value of having supermarkets has of course been revealed in excelsis during the coronavirus crisis. Without the flow of food and other products that supermarkets have continued to supply us, the country would truly be out of business. The supermarkets, their suppliers, their workers, have made it possible for the rest of us to keep going. When the pantheon of heroes during the current crisis is constructed, they, alongside first responders, physicians, and nurses, must have a prominent place.Running a hardware store calls for both detailed knowledge and vast competence. Ask a clerk in a hardware store for a rope one wants to use to hang one’s wife, and while escorting you to the rope section of the store, he is likely to ask you how much she weighs. Running a supermarket takes a wider competence and even greater managerial skills. Think on it. Dealing with that wide variety of foods, cleaning products, items of personal hygiene, plants, booze, and what-all else. Hiring and running a staff of a hundred or more people, upon whom one calls for both efficiency and courtesy while able to pay most of them not much above the minimum wage. And keeping the show running, as an increasing number of big-city supermarkets do, 24/7 (unlike the Hasidic detective, who stays on the case only 24/6). Does it seem wrong to say that being responsible for running a supermarket calls for greater skills and more intricate knowledge than running a think tank or a university? Not to me it doesn’t.While the contemporary supermarket cannot hope to replace the old neighborhood grocery store for friendliness, one cannot but admire what it achieves, and marvel at its management. Some years ago Philip Roth, in rather a boringly standard criticism of George W. Bush, said that he wasn’t smart enough to run a hardware store, let alone a country. I recall thinking at the time what an inept simile that was.3. Joseph Epstein offers hosannas to the grocery store and the supermarket. Eager to artificially prop up demand for the new—and expensive—“Obamacare” health-insurance plans, federal regulators in 2016 outlawed short-term health-insurance plans lasting more than three months. Several states recently implemented their own prohibitions. Such plans are inexpensive because they allow consumers to forgo various types of coverage (such as that for childbirth or mental health) that they would not need during their brief participation. Regula tors confidently asserted that few people would need such plans. Yet less than four years later, tens of millions of people would be thrown out of work, with no guarantee of being back in less than three months. In 2012, regulators finalized the reWith the massive 2010 Dodd–Frank law, regulators attempted to prevent large banks from putting the entire financial system at risk. But in doing so, they also piled a multitude of restrictions on small banks, which ten years later would (together with large banks) be prevented from serving desperate small-business applicants reeling from coronavirus lockdowns.When the Obama administration put “net neutrality” price controls on Internet service providers, it never anticipated that the entire country would be simultaneously stuck at home, requiring that various types of Internet traffic be prioritized in ways that the regulation prohibited. Thankfully, net neutrality was overturned in the U.S. not long before the pandemic. European regulators had to beg Netflix to voluntarily cut the quality of the video it delivers to customers in Europe, where net-neutrality rules still apply.When President Trump signed the new deregulatory Right to Try Act, allowing eligible patients access to investigational drugs (drugs shown to be safe but not yet FDA-approved because of their un known effectiveness), many commentators scoffed that few patients would receive such drugs who could not already do so by applying to one of the Food and Drug Ad ministration’s special programs. Less than two years later, Right to Try would make it possible to sweep away regulatory delays in developing treatments for COVID-19. The FDA can do a lot more to get out of the way of medical innovation, which could create trillions of dollars of value each year.Pandemics are not that rare (each year there is about a 4 percent chance of one involving the flu), but I do not blame regulators for failing to anticipate this one. They do, however, deserve blame for failing to yield more autonomy to households and businesses, which are keenly aware of their changing individual situations.2. Casey B. Mulligan proposes that the pandemic presents an opportunity for deregulation. This is the American way, a wing and a prayer. We count on the forgiveness of the vast wilderness and its once-perceived infinite resources. Fail, and you can pick up and go elsewhere, all the while enjoying the protection of God and the two great oceans. But those days are over.And, of course, Senator Bill Frist took it to the White House. He presented a strong—one might even say urgent—case for establishing joint research and vaccine-and-curative manufacturing centers judiciously spaced throughout the country; the doubling of medical- and nursing-school outputs; incentives for commercial pharmaceutical and medical-device research and production; increasing the number of hospital beds; providing for the stocks, structures, and reserve personnel for large-scale emergency field hospitals; and laying up stores of necessaries such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and, specifically, ventilators. Given that the laws of economics were not repealed, the ancillary effect of the supply surge in some of these medical goods—such as doctors, nurses, and hospital capacity—would have lowered their cost or at least slowed its rise. He asked for $100 billion per year. Had spending kept up at that level, which it need not have to assure adequate preparation, it would have amounted to only one-quarter of the monies shoveled into the furnace of COVID-19 in the last few weeks alone. He got a total of $2.4 billion over four years for the Strategic National Stockpile that of late has proved wholly inadequate.Fifteen years before the coronavirus pandemic, I wrote a speech for a world-renowned physician who was coincidentally the majority leader of the United States Senate, and thus not without influence. He went, wholeheartedly, all-in, delivering it in the Senate, at Harvard Medical School’s most important annual lecture, at Davos, at the Bohemian Grove (where the only Bohemian to enthuse sufficiently to request a copy was Henry Kissinger), and elsewhere.1. The issue’s principal piece is Mark Helprin’s major essay encouraging America to figure out a foreign- and national-security policy that is not reactive but course-charting. <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2020/05/04/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The new issue</a><strong>The May 5, 2020, Issue Presents Another All-Out Coronavirus Focus</strong>Again, behind-the-scenes consultations go on all the time. Presidents prudently speak to legislative leaders to get a sense of what Congress is willing to authorize. The executive and legislative branches speak with outside experts to test the pros and cons of existing or prospective policy.Still, our system is based on I am all for government officials’ getting the best advice while making policy in a time of crisis. There is nothing wrong with all these people consulting each other, and if a presidential task force is just an informal vehicle for facilitating that process, I suppose that’s fine.23. More Andy: These task forces have a problem with the separation of powers. A year and a half later, Democrats and the media are again undermining the principles of #MeToo, this time by ignoring and downplaying sexual-assault allegations against Joe Biden. While Biden himself has said in the past that we must believe every woman who alleges assault, he has since changed his tune. Now, he and his prominent backers — including one of Kavanaugh’s most vigorous critics, #MeToo celebrity advocate Alyssa Milano — have begun singing the praises of due process.By publicizing accusations that lacked the most basic aspects needed for credibility, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee jettisoned their responsibility to seek the truth and instead used vulnerable women as pawns in an effort to tarnish a political enemy. In doing so, they made it less likely that subsequent women who publicized their credible accusations would be believed.Even worse, media outlets lent credibility to the outlandish tale of Julie Swetnick, who, again without corroboration, alleged that Kavanaugh had “spiked” drinks at parties in high school to facilitate gang rape. Not only did outlets report on this claim despite the lack of evidence, but they 22. Biden’s Ox Gored: So much me the #MeToo movement, says Alexandra DeSanctis, who nails the biased lefty media. Days later, at a time when China had reported 361 deaths from the virus — and when, we know now, the actual number of Chinese deaths was actually much higher — Tedros, echoing the Chinese government’s stance, For as long as he could, Tedros was happy to validate Beijing’s clumsy efforts to minimize and downplay the viral outbreak in Wuhan. While China was actively covering up the virus and censoring information about it, Tedros lavished praise on Xi Jinping’s response as “transparent,” “responsible,” and “setting a new standard of the world.” Even as international pressure grew, he delayed declaring the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. When In retrospect, that episode bears a striking, chilling resemblance to the WHO’s response to the coronavirus’s appearance in China.When Tedros sought to become WHO director-general in 2017, he met with fierce opposition to his candidacy from Ethiopians angry with his service to and defense of the country’s abusive regime, as well as his record as minister of health. He was ultimately confirmed despite 21. Time to throw out the WHO hash, says Jianli Yang and Aaron Rhodes.

More VDH: The Professor has crafted a post-virus lexicon. While Law sympathizes with those taking part in violent protests to pressure the Hong Kong administration, she said she never took part.Meanwhile, there were calls to boycott “blue” enterprises and “red” capital from mainland China — which are mostly big, pro-government corporations — to break their market dominance. Some “blue shops” were vandalized. They included Starbucks in Hong Kong — operated by a local catering company — after the daughter of the company’s founder criticized the protesters and defended the police.There is thus also a “yellow economy.” More and more small shops and eateries publicly endorsed the anti-government movement; phone apps and maps began to label them for consumers who wanted to frequent them.Since last April, when increasingly violent clashes between pro-democracy protesters and police regularly broke out on its busy streets, Hong Kong has been color-coded: The “yellow camp” is pro-democracy and anti-government, and the “blue camp” supports the establishment, the police, and Beijing.Den Law has made it a habit to check her phone app and look for “yellow restaurants” whenever she eats out.19. As Mag Szeto explains, pro-democracy Hong Kongers are finding an economic way to protest (of note: they ain’t drinking Starbucks). The pretense that these barely identifiable actresses represent a ceiling-crashing level of achievement seems part of contemporary media’s stealth propaganda — particularly the fanciful side of the Although the article accompanying the photo is headlined “The Esteemed Black Actresses Who Finally Have the Spotlight,” you would be forgiven if you couldn’t recognize Taraji P.

President-elect Trump took a step in this direction when he accepted a phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in December 2016. The decision was criticized sharply by many in the foreign-policy establishment as a breach of protocol and a break with the U.S.’s “One China Policy.” For those of us horrified by the world’s persistent acquiescence to the PRC, it was a breath of fresh air. Today, with the brutality of Xi Jinping’s regime made plain by its treatment of the Uyghurs and Hong Kong protesters, and the dangers of its long reach laid bare by the coronavirus crisis and the WHO’s pathetic efforts to cover for the PRC’s role in its spread, the time has come to take the next step. While the U.S. can and should continue to reprimand the Chinese for their actions in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, these lectures do little to deter the PRC, or inspire anyone to stand up to it. Recognizing Taiwan while still acknowledging the PRC’s claim to the mainland, on the other hand, would represent a significant blow to the PRC and send a signal to the rest of the world that the days of pretending that the world is as the CCP says it is are over. Xi Jinping has said that Taiwan “must and will” be reunited with the PRC. The U.S. should say that it will remain an independent nation — and a beacon of hope to those suffering under authoritarian rule.Taiwan, the small island off the southern coast of the PRC to which Chiang Kai-shek and his followers fled after their defeat in the Chinese Civil War, has turned into a model of democracy, freedom, and human flourishing. It has its own distinct 16. Isaac Schorr has Taiwan’s back, and argues for the end of its shameful treatment on the global stage. Second, advocates assert that massive infrastructure spending will stimulate economic growth and create jobs. Economists across the political spectrum have debunked this myth for the obvious reason that infrastructure projects require several years of planning and regulatory reviews before they begin — at which point the economy has already recovered. In fact, the typical environmental impact statement alone takes President Trump asserts that today’s near-zero interest rates make such borrowing affordable. But what matters are the interest rates several years down the road when the planned infrastructure projects finally begin pouring pavement and borrowing money. Additionally, because Washington relies on short-term borrowing (rather than locking in low-interest rates long-term — markets have expressed First, let’s address the affordability assertions. Even before the pandemic hit, the budget deficit was already set to surpass $1 trillion this year on its way past $2 trillion within a decade under current policies. The cost of pandemic-related legislation, as well as the economic effect of the business shutdowns, threaten to push this year’s budget deficit past $4 trillion, or 20 percent of the economy — a level unseen in American history outside the height of World War II. Adding trillions in stimulus spending would test Washington’s borrowing capacity to a point where the Federal Reserve could have to monetize much of the new debt. This degree of borrowing is uncharted territory in the modern economy.15. Brian Riedl finds the prospect of infrastructure stimulus will accomplish one thing: burying America in debt. Don Paolo is one of many thousands of priests and faithful who, in these days of pandemic and closed churches, are suddenly immersing themselves in new technologies. They dare to try everything, thinking of those martyrs that, throughout the centuries, gave their lives to evangelize in the most hostile places on the planet, and how a puny technological barricade designed in a place as corny as Silicon Valley would not be able to stop them now. Now the history of the digital crusade is being written.The priest presses the button and starts broadcasting the mass on Facebook Live. He stands in front of the camera and starts the prayers when a virtual futuristic looking helmet lit with colored LED lights is placed on his head. He proceeds with solemn piety, unperturbed by what’s happening, but moments later a warrior’s costume appears to cover him. A few seconds later, he’s wearing shades and a hat like the Blues Brothers’, while Super Mario Bros. coins begin to rain down on the church. The priest in question is Don Paolo Longo of the Church of San Petro and San Benedetto in the Italian town of Polla. It’s March 24, and it’s the first time that he broadcasts services online. The good man has accidentally connected the animated filters. Many decades ago, when Don Paolo was ordained a priest, he was instructed in the seminary on the Third Council of Constantinople, Latin patristic theology, the hypostatic union in Jesus Christ, and other aspects of St. Thomas Aquinas’s 14. The churches may be closed, but Itxu Díaz finds the spiritual consciousness is a-stir. The federal government also botched the process for creating and administering coronavirus tests. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a new variant, a new test was needed to track its spread. What about drugs? Scientists are now studying whether Remdesivir may be effective in fighting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Remdesivir was developed six years ago to combat various viruses, including dengue fever, the West Nile virus, Zika, MERS, SARS, and Ebola. But it was never approved for use — apparently because Gilead Sciences (the patent holder) saw too little financial gain to warrant the cost of the FDA’s approval process. The result is that we are effectively starting from scratch in the search for a COVID-19 treatment.The response to the COVID-19 crisis is a case study in governmental ineptness. In 2006, the federal government estimated that 70,000 ventilator machines would be needed in a moderate influenza epidemic. Instead of going with a large, established device maker, in 2010 HHS hired Newport Medical Instruments, a small one, to build a fleet of inexpensive portable devices. Before production started, however, NMI was purchased by Covidien, a larger device maker. Eventually, Covidien 13. Charles Silver and David Hyman say if the pandemic has exposed anything, it’s the lunacy of the idea of national health care. Here’s my question for Murphy, though: Why do you think that those scientists couldn’t just directly put all of these social-distancing measures in place themselves? The answer, of course, is that Murphy absolutely Again, I am not slamming Murphy for saying he listened to what scientists had to say when deciding how to best protect his constituents from the threats of a global pandemic. Coronavirus is, for many, a matter of life and death — so I am glad to hear that he’d been seeking expert guidance in making these decisions.The truth is, Murphy’s comments represent an ideology that is completely unacceptable for a government leader in the United States. The philosophy of governance that he espoused on Wednesday was that not of an elected official in a free country but of a tyrant. That is, after all, what tyranny is — a system in which the people in power control citizens without any regard for their rights.In other words? In January 2018, Murphy solemnly promised, he Again: This is an absolute fact. It’s not up for debate, and what’s more, it’s not as if Murphy had no way to know so. Rather, before officially beginning his tenure as governor, Murphy himself took an oath of office that doesn’t just state 12. Kat Timpf offers New Jersey governor Phil Murphy an education on the Constitution, that thing with which he is quite unfamiliar, despite swearing an oath to uphold it. The coronavirus epidemic is proving to be an exception to this pattern.The case is a significant one, given the ongoing tension between (a) governmental restrictions to avoid the spread of COVID-19 and (b) individual liberties vouchsafed by our fundamental law, such as the freedoms to travel, associate with others, and exercise one’s religion. As I’ve Faced with the Justice Department’s opposition, State and municipal governments have the power to protect their citizens from the spread of infectious disease. “There is no pandemic exception, however, to the fundamental liberties the Constitution safeguards.” 11. Andy McCarthy applauds the Justice Department for having the back of religious liberty. Friedman wrote in the Tom Friedman the amiable but compulsively mistaken columnist of the 10. Conrad Black beats Tom Friedman like a drum over his preposterous “unity cabinet” advice for Joe Biden. I do understand, as a matter of principle, why a news organization would take more than two weeks to report Tara Reade’s assault allegation against Joe Biden. A newspaper In his telling, Baquet proceeded with caution and refused to run a “straightforward news story” when Reade first publicly accused Biden of assault on March 25. A “short, straightforward news story,” he said, would not “have helped the reader understand.” And that is the most important thing, Baquet emphasized: That you In his 9. John Hirschauer offers more on the “Regardless of what happens to Kavanaugh, however, this scandal has given us an X-ray view of the rotten foundations of elite male power,” she wrote. “Despite Donald Trump’s populist posturing, there are few people more obsessed with Ivy League credentials. Kavanaugh’s nomination shows how sick the cultures that produce those credentials — and thus our ruling class — can be.”Goldberg opened that September 2018 screed by recounting Deborah Ramirez’s allegation against Kavanaugh and, to her credit, noting that the Contrast this tone with the one Goldberg employed in 2018 when writing in response to sexual-misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The title of that column? “Pigs All the Way Down,” and the subtitle: “Kavanaugh and our rotten ruling class.”“What to Do With Tara Reade’s Allegation Against Joe Biden?” is the title of her most recent column, and the subheading: “A sexual assault accusation against the presumptive Democratic nominee is being used to troll the #MeToo movement.”Writing yesterday in the 8. More Groping Biden: Alexandra DeSanctis finds that the Tara Reade was one of the women who accused Biden in early 2019, but at the time, she did not accuse Biden of sexually assaulting her by penetrating her with his hands under her skirt, as she has now. Biden has never been asked personally to respond to Reade’s allegation. The When Biden entered the presidential race in April 2019, he was faced with a flurry of accusations by various women he’d interacted with over the years. The charges had a common thread: Biden has long been too free with his hands, with physical contact such as hugging and kissing and touching and smelling women’s hair, without regard for their personal space or consent. When the For all their lectures to the public about transparency and fearless independence, prestige journalists tend to be very reluctant to face accountability of their own. Ben Smith, who only recently left his position as editor in chief of A remarkable thing happened Monday: The 7. Dan McLaughlin lifts up the And the people who did the most to whip up this hysteria were the same ones who professed to be most alarmed at Russian meddling.In other words, the Russians may have succeeded in getting us to turn even more viciously against ourselves and conduct our politics in an ongoing crisis atmosphere — all by feeding a few lies to a private eye hired by the Hillary Clinton campaign to dig up dirt on Trump.We’ve spent years obsessing about Russian interference in our politics, and now it turns out that the original FBI investigation into the Trump campaign that morphed into the Mueller probe may have been instigated, in part, by Russian disinformation.President Donald Trump famously calls the investigation a hoax, a label he uses liberally, but in this instance it may literally be true.It is becoming increasingly clear that the Russian investigation as launched and conducted by James Comey’s FBI deserves to rank as one of the agency’s great blunders — at best.6. Obese Chance: Rich Lowry says James Comey should have to apologize for the FBI’s contemptible actions. Seems like there’s a huge and important story to tell here. To better understand how big, try to imagine the firestorm that would consume all of our lives if we learned that Trump’s Justice Department had knowingly relied on Russian disinformation, paid for by the RNC, to spy on the Biden campaign.All of this then sparked an open-ended independent Robert Mueller investigation that, though it failed to come back with a single indictment against anyone for criminal conspiracy with Russia during the 2016 campaign, succeeded in overwhelming our news coverage and convincing many gullible voters that the Russians had stolen the election.After Trump won the election in 2016, Obama holdovers and opponents of the president in new administration began leaking misleading snippets of the Trump–Russia investigation to a largely pliant media, which used to it fuel partisan hysteria that dominated American media coverage for three years.It should be reiterated that the FISA applications sought by the FBI were almost “Will someone with access ask former high-ranking Justice Department officials such as James Comey whether they were aware that the warrants obtained for eavesdropping on a presidential campaign were partisan documents contaminated with information from a foreign intelligence agency?5. More Harsanyi: And now, the real Russian scandal. Those could be valid public worries. But right now, the nation’s purposes are twofold: Don’t escalate the virus into a true pandemic of 1957 or 1918 proportions, and don’t wreck the economy with untold health consequences for hundreds of millions and financial burdens for generations yet to come.A few will insist that risking 60,000 deaths is not worth the gamble of restoring the economy, and that by inference our prior reactions to 1957 or 2017 were misguided and only now do we see our tragically enfeebled and derelict past responses.And still more will object that if quite radical changes in public hygiene were necessary just to reduce the virus to just possibly flu percentages, then it is inherently more contagious, dangerous, and lethal.Others will point out that the fatality to case percentage rate is not so important, given that this nasty virus can mysteriously kill on rare occasions those in their 30s-to-50s in a way not associated with the flu. It’s supposedly like a lone sniper that can take out anyone anytime, regardless of age, health, and location. After all, in 2017, when over 60,000 died from the flu, we did not read horrific stories of individual influenza suffering and tragic deaths in a way we daily read in the case of the current infection.Some will claim that pessimistic models were valuable in shocking public officials into draconian measures that alone rendered the virus to the lethal status of a bad flu — and thus must continue. So why trash the quarantines that allowed the discussion to return to work to proceed or indeed give us the opportunity to compare deaths to a bad flu year? Their point is that even if the virus could be found to be no more lethal than the flu, by curbing cases, deaths are also curbed, even if only 1-3 per 1000 infected.4. A well-informed public, says Victor David Hanson, can make the vital decisions facing America. This creates two immediate benefits for us. First, your decision to reopen our economy, even in Wuhan, will allow us to grow economically while our rivals go through a depression; our relative power will increase. Second, there will be many struggling businesses across the West that will survive only if we provide them financial support, allowing us to harvest even more aggressively their technology and intellectual property. The pandemic is opening the doors for us to grab a lot of Western industrial capabilities.Economically, the West is undergoing a massive disruption. One-third of the U.S. economy has stopped, while the federal deficit has skyrocketed because of a stimulus package. Italy, the world’s eighth-largest economy (and the EU’s third-largest) has been shut down for more than a month. It will not reopen before the summer. Similar situations are visible in the other Western economies.Our dead are an insignificant cost for the global gains the pandemic is bringing us, in large measure because our enemies fear casualties more than we do. Europe, the U.S. and the capitalist enemies in Asia have effectively shut down and, inward-focused, have temporarily withdrawn from the geopolitical competition.3. Jakub Grygiel pens a strategy memo to ChiCommie boss Xi Jinping. The problem was, the Chinese government was never the stabilizing, reasonable force for order that these Americans wanted to believe it was. We saw the regime’s true nature over three decades of brutal human-rights abuses and censorship and shameless lies to cover that brutality.The controversy over the NBA last year was a vivid demonstration that most of these entities were not going to let little things like the Chinese government forcing over one million ethnic minorities into concentration camps or a brutal crackdown in Hong Kong disrupt these extremely profitable relationships. These American companies had gone way too far down the road of partnership with China to turn back now and could For the last thirty years, the vast majority of powerful institutions in the United States placed a gargantuan bet on the idea that the government in Beijing could be a reliable partner in prosperity and would be a responsible actor on the world stage. Many leading politicians in both parties chose to believe this, many foreign-policy wonks chose to believe this, many academics and university administrators chose to believe this, and obviously, corporate America loved the idea of both using Chinese labor for imported goods and receiving access to the Chinese market. This includes Comcast, Disney, Viacom, AT&T, and Fox Corporation — the parent companies of NBC News, ABC News, CBS News, CNN, and Fox News, among other large multinationals that own major U.S. news organizations.2. Let’s just go with the title of this Jim Geraghty analysis: “Powerful Americans Were Catastrophically Wrong about China.” It makes sense for places like Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Maryland to ban large, avoidable gatherings. But it is an astonishing abuse of power to issue stay-at-home orders, enforced by criminal law, empowering police to harass and fine individuals for nothing more than taking a walk.Maybe a family needs new pajamas for their young kids because they’re stuck a new town. Or maybe mom needs a remote hard drive to help her work remotely. Or maybe dad just likes apples. Whatever the case, it’s absolutely none of your mayor’s business.Under what imperious conception of governance does Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer believe it is within her power to unilaterally I’m not even talking about national political and media elites who, after fueling years of hysteria over the coming Republican dictatorship, now demand Donald Trump dominate state actions. I’m talking about local governments.There has been lots of pounding of keyboards over the power grabs of authoritarians in Central and Eastern Europe. Rightly so. Yet right here, politicians act as if a health crisis gives them license to lord over the most private activities of America people in ways that are wholly inconsistent with the spirit and letter of the Constitution.1. It’s at times of crisis when our freedoms need to be preserved, writes David Harsanyi, not exploited by politicians who hate to see such crises — what was it Rahm said? — go to waste. <strong>The Horn of NRO Plenty Spilleth Forth Many Links, Thereby Providing Intellectual Refreshment and Edification by Thee and Thine</strong>Other ways of attacking this problem, though, depend on technologies and capacities that do not yet exist. A drug to treat the worst cases of the disease would be a godsend, saving lives and reducing the risks of reopening. At this writing there are highly promising signs regarding remdesivir, but we need to be aggressively testing as many options as we can. A good treatment is our most likely route out of this mess.The administration’s guidelines showcase one way of putting these concepts together. Areas with control over their outbreaks and adequate health-care capacity would start by slowly reopening businesses with strict social-distancing rules in place; then proceed, in Phase II, to more relaxed rules and reopening schools; and conclude with Phase III, in which businesses are back in full swing and even members of vulnerable populations can go out and about with some precautions.Even when businesses and schools do reopen, they should work to keep customers and students separated to the greatest degree practicable. Policymakers should also be mindful of the fact that the disease hits the elderly hard while overwhelmingly sparing children: Continuing to isolate the old while the young return to work and schools reopen will often make sense.3. The worst of the worst seems to the in the rear-view mirror. Ahead: The future. What to do about opening up. Because there are no existing vaccines or proven treatments for COVID-19, information is our most valuable resource in fighting this pandemic. Policymakers must calibrate their responses based on data collected domestically and received from abroad. In its capacity as the facilitator of international information exchanges, the WHO is supposed to vet and disseminate data from its 194 member states. The organization fell down on this most basic task by buying Chinese spin wholesale.Tedros objected to Trump’s correct decision to impose travel restrictions on China, claiming it would “have the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit” — a stark contrast with his deferential statements about China’s response. In mid January, the WHO announced that there was “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus,” despite It’s no secret that the White House got off to a late start in combating the coronavirus. Trump downplayed the threat of the disease even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans to brace for an outbreak, and we criticized him for it. But this obviously doesn’t vindicate the World Health Organization. We noted its failures 2. Yes, Mr. President, you are right to clobber WHO. It has indeed been galling to watch many within the press corps repeatedly ask Trump why he has declined to preempt gubernatorial decisions or shut down grocery stores when he does not enjoy the power to do either. It was galling, too, to watch many of those same voices erupt in indignation when, eventually, he began to talk as if he does. But that, ultimately, is of secondary importance. It is the responsibility of the American president not only to uphold the Constitution in action, but to proselytize on its behalf. To hear the words “the authority is total” pass the lips of our chief executive was jarring, unwelcome, and dangerous. Now, as ever, “In fact, “the governors” do not know that, and nor does anybody else for that matter, because it is simply not true. The United States is a federal republic in which the national government enjoys only limited powers, and in which the president plays a subservient role to Congress within that limited government. There are many actions that the White House can take in the course of fighting this outbreak, but usurping the police powers of the 50 states is not among them. On this, the Constitution is clear.Asked during his press conference by what authority he intends to “reopen” the United States when the threat from coronavirus has dissipated, President Trump struck an absolutist tone. “I have the ultimate authority,” he insisted. “When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total and that’s the way it’s got to be . . . It’s total. The governors know that.”1. No, Mr. President, you don’t have total authority. <strong>Editorials</strong>There is much below to entertain your intellect.By the way: In case you were wondering, as surely you must be, the distance between the Green at Lexington and Wuhan’s CCP-run bat-lab — It is good to remember The initial fights (the tubercular Captain Today, Saturday, is the 18th of April, that date esteemed in patriotic poetry, surely a good time to remember those aged, seminal events that sparked our distinct lives of liberty, as free men and women — the rides of Revere and Dawes through the villages and Middlesex countryside, sounding the alarm of the approaching Redcoats, the shot heard round the world (albeit likely from a British pistol), the battles on the 19th at the Green at Lexington (bloody hell for the colonials) and Concord’s North Bridge (our turn to inflict damage), embattled farmers standing under the unfurled flag . . .Dear <em>. . . </em>National ReviewFollow Us",0,"Spirit, That Made Those Heroes Dare . . ."

Policymakers should continue to accelerate drug development and build capacity to administer drugs that work. But the likelihood of a COVID-19 therapeutic in the near future remains slim. Relying on a Hail Mary to reopen the economy is too risky. The White House guidelines for reopening, which emphasize contact tracing and building medical capacity, point in the right direction. While a COVID-19 drug would be a miracle, we should plan for a future without one.Though still unproven, remdesivir shows promise, and we should all hope it works.

Perhaps <span>NOW WATCH: </span>What’s stranger about the exuberant response to the But only critical symptoms lead to death: A COVID-19 As Harvard doctor Jeremy Faust But the results leaked Thursday are far from definitive. The study in question is a “compassionate use” trial, in which experimental drugs are given to patients with severe illnesses prior to FDA approval. Compassionate-use studies do not include control groups of patients not treated with the drug, making it impossible to distinguish between the effects of RDV and the natural course of the illness. Gilead was quick to caution against reading too much into the preliminary results, saying in a statement that “the totality of the data need to be analyzed in order to draw any conclusions from the trial.” Indeed, the outcomes of the Chicago patients could be wholly unrelated to the treatment, and there is some evidence that the results are unexceptional.Remdesivir is a nucleoside analogue that works by inhibiting viral reproduction. Administered intravenously, RDV has a better safety profile than other drugs under consideration for COVID-19 treatment. Gilead initially developed RDV as a treatment for Ebola, and though it did not prove effective in that case, it works against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. If effective in humans, RDV would enable the rollback of physical-distancing measures and business closures. “Problem solved,” the stock-market rally seemed to say.<span class=""drop"">O</span>

Voters should know that there is nothing left of the Democratic Party but self-absorption, partisan greed, and racial trigger happiness.Yes, Democrats. Go ahead and filibuster, so the fragments of your “fight for the little guy” façade will blow away and reveal that the pure, bitter quest for rank partisanship and racial tension are all that remain of this once-presentable party.  
   With each passing moment, Democrats will expose themselves as America’s most selfish people, who — once again — have stepped over the crushed dreams of their countrymen, stood atop the cadavers of their fellow Americans, and split apart this rather re-unified country in its darkest hour since World War II.McConnell should force Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and his comrades to occupy the Senate floor, hour after hour, and tell the American people why racial and gender quotas are more important than saving employees from joblessness and companies from bankruptcy. Let Democrats, one after another, face the nation and detail their pet plans to cleave Americans by complexion and chromosomes. Let Democrats argue that identity politics trumps a $250 billion tourniquet on the economic hemorrhage wrought by this clandestine enemy’s invisible Blitzkrieg against our beloved Republic.For now, Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky should reconvene the Senate. If Democrats continue to torpedo this measure, he should do with Democratic obstructionists what he always should do with them: Make them filibuster.<img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-802407"" data-image-id=""802407"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" height=""417"" loading=""lazy"" sizes=""(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"" src=""https://i2.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Bloomberg-headline-swap-covers-for-Democrats-April-9-2020.jpg?resize=1363%2C417&amp;ssl=1"" srcset=""https://i2.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Bloomberg-headline-swap-covers-for-Democrats-April-9-2020.jpg?w=1363&amp;ssl=1 1363w, https://i2.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Bloomberg-headline-swap-covers-for-Democrats-April-9-2020.jpg?resize=300%2C92&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Bloomberg-headline-swap-covers-for-Democrats-April-9-2020.jpg?resize=1024%2C313&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Bloomberg-headline-swap-covers-for-Democrats-April-9-2020.jpg?resize=768%2C235&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Bloomberg-headline-swap-covers-for-Democrats-April-9-2020.jpg?resize=459%2C140&amp;ssl=1 459w, https://i2.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Bloomberg-headline-swap-covers-for-Democrats-April-9-2020.jpg?resize=800%2C245&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-Bloomberg-headline-swap-covers-for-Democrats-April-9-2020.jpg?resize=50%2C15&amp;ssl=1 50w"" width=""1363""/>Predictably, the Democrats’ But race-warrior Democrats couldn’t care less.The Democrats’ sabotage came the morning after Even worse, Democrats scuttled this small-business rescue mission so that they could savor their favorite indoor activity: destabilizing the USA via racial politics. Before they would consent to this infusion for PPP, Democrats insisted on set asides for minority- and women-owned businesses — as if any American banker today is thinking: “I’ll be damned if I approve a loan application from some black guy or some chick.”Rather than join this emergency bucket brigade, the same Democrats who accuse Republicans of divisiveness stayed busy draining these buckets, and letting the financial fires blaze more brightly.On April 9, news broke that 16.6 million Americans had lost work in the previous three weeks. Democrats chose that of all dates to sandbag, yet again, financial assistance that Trump and Republicans have tried to supply. In this instance, it was $250 billion for additional, potentially forgivable loans in the Paycheck Protection Program, to entice small businesses to keep their workers. These laborers are among the 330 million Americans enduring soft house arrest. While conservatives  did not do cartwheels over a quarter-trillion dollars in job subsidies, the alternative was far less cheerful: Watching millions more blameless Americans lose their jobs, swamp local unemployment offices, and register for months or even years on the dole, as this economy slip slides away.Democrats and leftist journalists then attacked hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a 65-year-old anti-malaria and anti-lupus drug that has shown some hope against COVID-19. Because President Trump has discussed HCQ optimistically, his enemies reflexively have mocked it and even, using gubernatorial power, prohibited doctors and pharmacists from dispensing it to COVID-19 patients. Far better, the Left’s behavior indicates, for them to embarrass Trump with HCQ’s failure than for it to succeed and vindicate Trump. If this would cost COVID-19 patients their lives, that’s elusive on the Left’s list of worries.
Some 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment that week. If Pelosi and Senate Democrats had cooperated, President Trump would have signed that bill on March 22, rather than March 27 — an entire business week sooner. If this had saved 10 percent of these jobs, then Democrats and their partisan fetishism herded 330,000 Americans into unemployment. Probably more.“In the United States, as of this morning, there were 471 deaths reported due to coronavirus,” a disgusted Senator Ted Cruz (R., Texas) said March 23. “As of right now, it’s 573. That means today, 102 Americans died while the Democrats were blocking consideration of this bill.”While Trump stayed busy “not responding,” Democrats hurled wrenches into the works. On the brink of bipartisan passage of COVID-19 relief, filibustering Senate Democrats stalled the $2.2 trillion CARES Act for five business days last month. Pelosi abused this national emergency to demand taxpayer dollars for the musician-hating Kennedy Center, subsidies for windmills and solar panels, an ingenious ruse to fund illegal-alien-criminal-coddling Somehow, while fiddling with bloody hands, President Trump managed to impose his ban on alien-arrivals from China on January 31, one day after the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic.

Joyce’s kids are grieving, and grieving people say overwrought things sometimes; I don’t blame them for that. But printing this entire thing is shoddy and shabby.Let’s walk through this one. Joyce is described as showing severe symptoms 13 days after returning from the cruise. In the interim, he went to work at a bar in Brooklyn. Another of his bartenders got the virus, too; we are not told whether anyone else on the cruise also got it. Brooklyn, every bit as much as Spain, is in the midst of “a full-blown outbreak.” There is nothing here to suggest that Joyce would have avoided the virus by staying in Brooklyn, and there’s significant reason to believe it is likelier that what killed him was going to work while the city was still open. That wasn’t Sean Hannity’s doing.On March 14, they returned to New York from Barcelona, and In fact, Bellafante concedes that she doesn’t even have any basis to say that Joyce got the virus from the cruise:If you got your news from the mainstream media and Democratic politicians, you were still not getting anything like a consistent message at the end of February and early March that this was something to cancel your plans over. And if you did cancel them, you were probably safer on a cruise ship than in Brooklyn, which became a center of coronavirus outbreaks.
Bellafante herself, on February 27, I first started poking a few weeks ago at the idea of whether the mainstream media should have been more alarmist about the coronavirus sooner. When I talked to Brian Stelter, CNN’s media reporter, on March 10, he told me he didn’t want to cause “undue fear” in his coverage, and that extended to the way he edited the on-air chyrons that ran during his While President Trump has been correctly pilloried for describing the coronavirus as less dangerous than the flu, that message was commonplace in mainstream media outlets throughout February. And journalists — including my colleagues at March 1 was two days before the Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Nobody in the world of liberal commentary was talking about delaying them. Peter Kafka of On the other hand, it is also highly unlikely that Joyce was influenced to take a cruise, on March 1, by something Sean Hannity said on his nightly program Ten days later, de Blasio was still insisting that “if you’re not sick, you should be going about your life,” and he was still balking at closing schools. Large gatherings were still permitted. The densely packed subways were carrying over 5 million riders a day. As March 1: Remember that date. It was the day of the first confirmed coronavirus case in New York, a day after the first report of a U.S. death. Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio held On March 1, Joe Joyce and his wife, Jane, set sail for Spain on a cruise, flying first to Florida. His adult children — Kevin, Eddie and Kristen Mider — suggested that the impending doom of the coronavirus made this a bad idea. Joe Joyce was 74, a nonsmoker, healthy. . . . He didn’t see the problem. “He watched Fox, and believed it was under control,’’ Kristen told me. Early in March Sean Hannity went on air proclaiming that he didn’t like the way that the American people were getting scared “unnecessarily.’’ He saw it all, he said, “as like, let’s bludgeon Trump with this new hoax.”The column is framed around the death of Joe Joyce, a bar owner from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Joyce was a Trump supporter; his son, a friend of Bellafante’s, “was at odds with his father politically.” Bellafante admits that Joyce was not the pro-Trump monster of media caricature: “He was not going to make the Syrian immigrant who came in to play darts feel as if he belonged anywhere else. . . . In his bar Joe Joyce had set the tone for what evolved into an incongruously progressive place. From the beginning there had been a quiet gay presence.” But his death is too politically useful, it seems, to resist. And with Joyce gone, his Ivy League–educated kids get the last word.

But right now, it’s already pretty darn bad. It may well be less bad sometime soon. But we need to be prepared psychologically, medically, socially — for this to get really, really bad.The fear is that New York, while having all of these factors, shows what happens when this virus hits a place that just isn’t prepared or taking precautions. Probably no place else in America will get hit quite so badly — but that doesn’t mean that cases won’t increase in other places. We’re probably past the first peak. But sending people back to work means the number of cases and deaths will increase, and we will get at least another peak . . . perhaps a series of peaks and troughs.San Francisco County has 1,160 cases.Dallas County, has 2,428 cases.Harris County, Texas, which includes Houston, has 4,653 cases.Orleans Parish, which includes New Orleans, has 6,000 cases.Suffolk County, Mass., which includes Boston, has 7,696 cases.Miami-Dade County, Fla., has 9,165 cases.Philadelphia County, Pa., has 9,214 cases.Los Angeles County, Calif., has 12,021 cases.Wayne County, Mich., which includes Detroit, has 13,471 cases.Cook County, Ill., which includes Chicago, has 20,395 cases.As of Sunday afternoon, New York City had 134,000 cases.But a lot of big cities in the United States have these factors to varying degrees: a lot of international travelers, somewhat comparable population density, significant numbers of seniors, heavily used mass transit, and at least comparably idiotic mayors. But no city in the United States is even close to the number of cases in New York.One of the great mysteries of this epidemic is why New York City is getting so relentlessly hammered compared to the rest of the country. We can point to a slew of possible reasons — the city is an international air-travel hub, it has high population density, it has about a million people over age 65, it has heavily used enclosed mass transit like subways, commuter rail, and buses, it had Mind you, we know that Then again . . . Massachusetts is Even if we take that low end of that estimate, that fifty infected people are walking around for every detected case . . . do we think almost 80 percent of New York City residents are walking around with the coronavirus? (I doubt this is the case, but if it were, this percentage would be knocking on the door of herd immunity, and we would expect the number of new cases to drop like a stone.) The “fifty people have it for every diagnosed person” theory would mean 12.1 million New Yorkers have it out of 19.4 million; 4.2 million New Jersey residents out of 8.8 million, and 1.8 million Massachusetts residents out of 6.8 million.New York City only has 8.5 million people in the five boroughs, about 20 million in the wider metropolitan area. If your estimated number of cases in an area is more than the number of human beings living in that area, you’re probably overestimating somewhere along the line.If we really are detecting only one out of 50 cases because we are doing so little testing, as that study suggests, applying that ratio to other places gives you some really odd results. As of Sunday, New York City has 134,000 cases. If you multiply that by 50, you get 6.7 million cases. If you multiply the number of cases by 85, you get 11.39 million cases.But there are some reasons to think the conclusions are far too optimistic. You can find People want hope right now, and that study argued, “we’re a lot closer to herd immunity than most experts think we are, because massive amounts of our people have already caught it and fought it off.” It would be wonderful if what this study is suggesting is true.On Friday afternoon, a lot of people started touting <strong>The Rosetta Stone of Santa Clara and the Mystery of New York City’s Disaster</strong>To the extent we can, as safely as we can, let’s reopen the doctor’s offices and all the non-coronavirus health care that’s been forced onto hiatus for more than a month.One of the crazier side effects of this pandemic is hospitals being forced to lay off workers because they don’t have enough cash coming in and because care for coronavirus patients uses up so many resources. This is not a small problem; as of April 17, at least One side effect of all this is that because these procedures are how these hospitals make most of their money, a lot of hospitals, particularly in rural areas, are struggling to keep their doors open. (Please hold off on the debate of whether this is how hospitals On Friday, four big medical associations — the American College of Surgeons, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the Association of perioperative Registered Nurses, and the American Hospital Association — laid out But don’t tell me that Americans are greedy and selfish in the face of this crisis. Americans who were expecting to have surgeries and treatments to relieve chronic pain and serious health problems accepted delays — in some cases, delays of five weeks or more — just so we could collectively increase the odds that everyone else would have a better shot at surviving coronavirus. We have a lot of heroic doctors, nurses, technicians, support staff, janitors, emergency medical technicians, and other people who work in those hospitals. But we probably ought to reserve a round of applause for everybody out there who accepted a delay in treatment — even if they didn’t have much of a choice.The states, institutions, and doctors that delayed those procedures were not callous or “Chicken Littles.” They needed to ensure that hospital beds and personal protective equipment were available in quantities sufficient to handle an influx of coronavirus cases. Thankfully, (In some cases, oncologists may worry that regular cancer treatments like chemotherapy will weaken the immune system of the patient, making them more vulnerable to a coronavirus infection.)I offered this thought “Elective” procedures sound like they’re optional; when some people hear that phrase, they may envision plastic or cosmetic surgery. What they mean, in most states, is non-emergency, a procedure that is not a matter of life and death. But there are a lot of procedures that are important, even if they’re not life-and-death.As the United States begins its first tentative steps out of a widespread and unprecedented lockdown, allow me to recommend that the one of the first changes we make is lifting the restrictions on “elective” medical procedures. <strong>Make America Care for Non-Coronavirus Patients Again</strong>On the menu today: a non-coronavirus medical problem facing America that probably can’t be put off any longer; enormous excitement about that study of the coronavirus in Santa Clara, Calif., and some evidence of why that study’s suggested ratio of unknown infections to known infections can’t fit the worst-hit places, laying out all the possible factors that made New York City the epicenter of the outbreak in America; and one large U.S. company does the unthinkable: It decides it doesn’t need aid money that badly and gives it back to the government.National ReviewFollow Us",0,"Non-COVID Patients Need Care, Too"

While innumerable factors contribute to the fatality rate, the U.S. medical system seems to be doing a comparatively good job of treating COVID-19 patients.While the coronavirus is devastating many America metropolitan areas, and policymakers should have acted sooner to contain it, the U.S. does not seem to be faring worse than comparable countries. We’ve ramped up testing to among the highest levels in the world, and the growth in new cases is slowing across states. Still, there’s a long way to go before a full reopening, which requires higher testing and a contact-tracing apparatus.However, adjusting for population size, the U.S. has about as many cases as most of Western Europe, and is well below Spain and Italy. Singapore had remarkable success in containing the virus initially, but its numbers have skyrocketed lately, with cases doubling over the past few days. If it continues on this trajectory, Singapore will soon reach the per capita caseloads of Western Europe.As of Monday, 760,000 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the U.S., more than three times the number of any other country (I’m leaving out China, since its official numbers are inaccurate). Pundits have cited these numbers in comparing the U.S. policy response unfavorably to other countries fighting the pandemic.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Coronavirus Update: Is the U.S. the Epicenter of the Pandemic?

It is a dispute over whether to permit the act that abortion is, no matter what we call it.My concern about addressing the reality of abortion is precisely why An editorial choice like the one Mahone outlines for Articles such as this one are far more revealing than their authors intend. The battle for public opinion on abortion most often takes the form of a battle over terms. For instance, is a person who supports legal abortion in most circumstances “pro-abortion” or “pro-choice” or an “abortion-rights supporter”? Should those who oppose legal abortion be called “pro-life” or “anti-abortion” or “anti-choice”? Is a human being in utero a “fetus” or an “unborn child” or, as Mahone so blandly puts it, a “product of conception”? These quibbles tend to take up the most space in our broader arguments over abortion policy.“Using language that accurately describes the realities of abortion care won’t stop lawmakers or state officials from trying to take away the constitutional right to abortion,” Mahone concludes, “but it does contribute to our ongoing efforts to reduce abortion stigma in the news.”Mahone then notes that “anti-abortion activists” have “weaponized” the term “surgical abortion” in the era of COVID-19, as governors across the country have deemed elective abortions “non-essential” in order to prevent the spread of disease and conserve medical resources for emergency procedures.The term “surgical abortion” has been used by health professionals—and, until now, by “Instead of referring to ‘medication and surgical’ abortion to distinguish between abortions induced by pills and abortions performed as an in-clinic procedure, The site’s latest editorial is an example of the latter, giving insight into how abortion advocates shift their language to influence public perception of what abortion is and, as a consequence, whether it should be permitted. “Notes on Language: Why We Stopped Using ‘Surgical Abortion’ at <em><span class=""skimlinks-unlinked"">Rewire.News</span></em>National ReviewFollow Us",0,‘Notes on Language’: Rewiring the Terminology of Abortion

Taxpayers and consumers are owed at least this much for a further bailout.As a condition of another pot of taxpayer money, Congress should codify an HHS With all the spending Congress already has approved, additional money for hospitals at this time is not responsible. However, if Congress hastily offers a second bailout, it’s vital that certain conditions be placed to protect consumers. These could be modeled on HHS’s wise decision to condition receipt of the initial bailout funds on hospitals’ agreement not to charge patients more for coronavirus treatments than their insurance company agrees to pay, preventing a practice called balance billing.Policymakers must have realistic estimates of the amount of revenue that will return to hospitals and medical facilities when reopening occurs. Significantly, loan programs, such as the HHS program underway, are designed to get providers through a temporary revenue drought and are far more appropriate than a bailout. And some hospitals have greater needs than others.It’s important to consider that the epidemic has been severe in only a few regions of the country. Can some hospitals and other medical facilities, such as independent surgery centers, open their doors for non-emergency services now, or relatively soon? Are further government bailouts needed, since a portion of delayed care will eventually be scheduled and HHS has created a significant 
Yet before exacerbating the profound fiscal and monetary distortions by spending more on hospitals, policymakers need to confront three questions, particularly since the anticipated coronavirus surge failed to materialize in most of the country.Congress gave enormous flexibility to the secretary of health and human services (HHS) to distribute the funds. The first $30 billion is out the door and was based on past Medicare payments. The HHS secretary also decided to compensate hospitals for treating the uninsured, and this funding will likely be several billion dollars. Although two-thirds of the initial bailout funding still needs to be distributed, hospitals and some of their congressional allies are calling for another $75 billion in taxpayer assistance.But that money isn’t free. Congress provides it through additional borrowing. For the Hospitals appealed to Congress for relief, and Congress delivered, with a $100 billion bailout fund and an increase in Medicare payments for coronavirus treatments.

No charge.Italian banks may end up owning companies because the owners preferred not to pay their debt and quit instead. Extensive shareholding on the part of banks may make them even more vulnerable, after COVID-19 and 0 percent interest rates. Nationalization, or a new IRI, will then be the only option for the Italian government, turning the clock back to 1933. The Italian government seems to eagerly seek the opportunity. There is a question that should haunt the dreams of Italian rulers: Once the lockdown is over, how many of the country’s entrepreneurs will decide not to go back to business? A high regulator burden and a byzantine bureaucracy are typical features of the Italian business environment, and its capitalists know how to handle them. But if their property rights are seized in the pandemic or if they feel they are not the owners of the companies they build, they may be tempted to throw in the towel. But more important, in order to “protect” Italian entrepreneurs from international predators, this measure is de facto dispossessing them, including founders and owners of medium-size businesses, from their own property. A country such as Italy should mind its geopolitical alliances, but this has little to do with crushing property rights. The essence of property over anything is the ability to alienate it if you wish. If you cannot sell it, it is not yours.For another, it is likely to create trouble for Italian start-ups, particularly in new technology. If they seek international angel investors or private-equity funds, eager to connect them with their Silicon Valley equivalents, their life is going to be more difficult. If every country produces a certain number of good ideas, money will move to finance them when it is least hampered.For one thing, this measure (which is supposed to stay on the books only until December 31, but could of course be renewed) is inflicting another blow to Italian small investors. If they can sell their stocks only to fellow Italians, the value of these stocks is unlikely to increase.The government responded not by redefining the concept but by enlarging it. First, it began to include business “at high intensity of technology”: a definition carefully ambiguous. Now the government led by Giuseppe Conte has further extended its golden power to banks and insurers, to “critical infrastructure,” to nanotechnology and biotech companies, to artificial intelligence, robotics and cybersecurity, to companies that deal with “sensible information, including personal data,” and to the food supply chain. It will not matter if new shareholders are European companies; thus, this is another nail in the coffin of the European single market. If any business wants to enroll a new shareholder from outside the boundaries of the EU, possessing a stake higher than 10 percent or worth more than a million euros, it must seek the government’s explicit permission. Let me stress: If Golden power is the Italian version of the British “golden share.” It is a set of rules established 2012 that enables the government to dictate conditions in the procedure of purchasing shares by foreign parties and even to stop a share-purchasing operation. This was, at the beginning, meant for so-called “strategic sectors”: businesses related to national defense, telecommunications, transport, and energy. Certainly it is difficult to know what is “strategic” before you need it: Who would have considered “strategic” the production of face masks before COVID-19 hit us?
At first, in a familiar move, short-selling was banned. Since then, together with a range of measures aimed at supplying liquidity to Italian businesses by offering state guarantees to lenders, the Italian government has engineered an extension of its “golden power.” The consequences of this expansion will be far-reaching.Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the Italian stock market has lost something like 20 percent of its value. As happens in times of crisis, otherwise very sound companies, such as Fiat Chrysler or ENI and Tenaris, have lost something in the neighborhood of 45 percent in their stock value from last year. Fears of hostile takeovers by foreign “predators” have proliferated.It is generally agreed that COVID-19 could be as serious a crisis as 1929. It is possible that this predicament will yield an even greater state ownership of formerly private companies. In most countries this would be an unintended consequence of prolonged lockdowns, but in Italy, it may well happen by design.For this reason, in 1933 the Italian Institute for Industrial Reconstruction (IRI) was established by the fascist regime. The government nationalized the banks and placed the shares of businesses it owned in a dedicated holding, to be managed by a few capable technocrats. Mussolini himself thought it was a “convalescent home” for Italian businesses, aimed at a quick recovery. IRI would later be held by Franklin Roosevelt as a model for his NRA. It was not until the 1990s that IRI was dismantled and its controlled companies privatized; the holding was liquidated in 2000. In other words, it took nearly 70 years for Italy to get its state-controlled businesses out of the convalescent home.<span class=""drop"">I</span>

People become invested in their own work; they come to believe their critics are not just wrong but dangerous; and they end up lashing out in frustration. Still, if the goal is to bring skeptics to their side, this is exactly the wrong way to do it.Nothing from Dr. Vinetz’s quote conflicts with Berenson’s positions — most hospitals are far from overflowing, they have more flexibility than expected, and non-COVID-19 patients should be encouraged to return so that beds don’t go unused. Nevertheless, Dr. Vinetz felt the need to throw in not one, but two gratuitous insults.Why is this guy [Berenson] even getting any oxygen? People are under-using the system in terms of the regular catastrophic circumstances like heart attacks or strokes or elective procedures, so we don’t overwhelm the hospital system, so that’s why some medical workers are being laid off. The fear of getting COVID-19 [is] why people are not coming into the hospitals for other health issues and for elective surgeries. It’s to free up the facilities for COVID patients. He should stick to his novel writing. He should go back to school to learn some science.Not to be outdone in the Finally, even if “all of the models say this is going to be one of the worst epidemics,” that is hardly the end of the policy debate. It can be simultaneously true that we face a terrible epidemic Furthermore, IHME has underestimated its own uncertainty. Although I am a mere policy analyst, I do know that when IHME offers 95 percent prediction intervals, then the actual values are supposed to fall outside those intervals only 5 percent of the time. Applying that standard, critics Note the arrogant tone, the name-calling, and the argument from authority. This is how Professor Gonsalves intends to win over the skeptics? It’s not even clear what his point is. Yes, all predictive models have uncertainty, but it follows that the more uncertain the model, the less useful its predictions are. That should not be controversial.Models are not crystal balls. A modeler is giving you a range of potential outcomes. What he [Berenson] is doing is what a lot of people who don’t understand science do, they take the uncertainty built into a model and say, “Oh, well, it shows these people don’t know what they are talking about.” He is playing with scientific uncertainty in order to say, “See, I know what is right here.” He is somebody with a messianic complex. And to be clear, all of the models say this is going to be one of the worst epidemics we have ever faced.People whose expertise has been questioned often respond in ways that further alienate the skeptics.

He called Hugh a “third-rate radio announcer.” Last month, he tweeted that Rep. Thomas Massie was “a third rate Grandstander.” (Capital G, even!) More recently, he called Jonathan Karl a “third-rate reporter” who “will never make it.” (Karl is the White House correspondent of ABC News.)

But social distancing is now seen by many people as “politically correct.” That’s exactly how President Trump described it — and millions take their lead from him. A Left-Right divide has developed on this thing, as it routinely does. You can only guess that this divide will widen as this pandemic wears on.How does that thinking strike you? Reasonable? It is certainly popular — check out the ratings.• On Friday, Trump tweeted, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” He also tweeted, “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” and so on. These are states with Democratic governors. Laura Ingraham, the Fox host, tweeted, “How many of those who urged our govt to help liberate the Iraqis, Syrians, Kurds, Afghanis, etc., are as committed now to liberating Virginia, Minnesota, California, etc?”People ought to use more imagination.You know, I don’t see why they can’t pick another dictator.

Others are referring to her as “Hitmer.” Get it? Protesters in Lansing held signs that said, “Heil, Hitmer.”  
   This is why this situation is so tricky, even diabolical.When I made this point on Twitter, lots of people responded, “You err on the side of freedom! Freedom, dammit! This is America! Freedom!” Great. But what if your personal decisions affect the health of others? If you want to take risks, fine and dandy. If you want to engage in dangerous rock climbing — and risk tumbling to your death — who am I to stop you? But what if the risks • Then, of course, they have to govern. And it can be very hard — as now. I don’t envy the governors, for the decisions they have to make. What kind of lockdown should they impose, if any?

I think you’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t. This is an excruciating period.These guys know what it takes to get elected. That’s why they’re there. They are clever as all get-out.• Governor DeSantis demonstrated his populist skills when he was running for the office in 2018. He cut an ad, showing him as a parent. He and his little daughter play with blocks, as the governor-to-be says, “Build the wall.” He reads to his infant son out of Said DeSantis, “I think people have been starved for content.” And what content!I think that the great populists of the past — Huey Long, George Wallace — and even the incumbent president, Donald Trump, would have to stand back in admiration, going “Dayum.”• Move, now, to U.S. politics. I believe I have seen the most populist move ever — ever. It was executed by Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who, in this pandemic, has declared professional wrestling an “essential service.”Dispiriting. But in my experience, however limited, the spirits of Thae Yong-ho and Ji Seong-ho are very high. And these men I remark to Thae that it must be bewildering to him to meet apologists for dictatorships — especially North Korea’s, the worst — in free countries. Yes.In South Korea, he meets people on the left who struggled for democracy and human rights in their country, when it was under dictatorship. Yet many of these same people are reluctant to talk about democracy and human rights for North Koreans. They want to change the subject.How do South Koreans, his brother Koreans, treat Thae? It depends, he says. South Korea is polarized on the issue of North Korea. People on the left treat him with scorn. I remark that they might try living in North Korea, if they think it’s so great — which makes Thae smile. . . .• Let me do some quoting — just a little — from my piece on Thae Yong-ho:This is something to remember, the next time someone tells you that this people or that is not fit for freedom and democracy.

But one half lives in the darkness of tyranny and the other half lives in the light of democracy.Try to imagine being born in North Korea, a police state, a gulag state — a “psychotic state,” as Jeane Kirkpatrick called it. The worst place on earth. After many tribulations, you are elected to the legislature in a free, democratic country. It’s not the country of your birth, and you wish it were.

No charge.The United States must protect sovereign immunity, not degrade it by political gestures that, however well-intentioned, could embolden Beijing and make U.S. officials vulnerable without actually helping a single American.China has much to answer for. We should be in aggressive diplomatic negotiations, working with like-minded nations to demand those answers. Our government should seek compensation for Americans harmed by China’s negligence in allowing the pandemic to spread and covering it up — a tall diplomatic order when we are concurrently seeking cooperation and reasonably civil relations. But enabling lawsuits is the wrong way to go about that task.If there is a silver lining in the COVID-19 catastrophe, it is this moment of clarity. We should now realize that the best path ahead involves severing our complex tangle of financial and commercial relations with Beijing, and publicly shoring up our support for Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and other regional allies menaced by China. Perhaps President Trump could stop referring to the monstrous Xi Jinping as if he were a friend, and to Xi’s regime as if its intentions were benign. We don’t court war, but we do want to make clear that we can tell our friends from our foes and act accordingly.The United States would be a safer place if we shed the green eye shades and rose-tinted glasses, stopped regarding China as a coveted market and potential strategic partner, and started seeing it for what it is: a hostile, aggressive power that seeks to displace us on the world stage.Furthermore, let’s bear in mind that no nation on earth is as active as ours in scientific research on substances whose accidental mishandling — let alone purposeful deployment — could have catastrophic consequences. No nation on earth is as active as ours in humanitarian interventions that, however well-intentioned, sometimes result in considerable collateral damage. Do we really want to encourage the adoption of a principle that sovereign immunity from lawsuits should be denied to a country that was acting within its legitimate rights if its actions caused unintentional harm?While China’s misfeasance was probably unintentional, its cover-up has been the opposite: willful and insidious. Day after day come righteous complaints from U.S. lawmakers and American officials that Beijing’s lack of transparency is costing us the time and data that we need to save lives. What incentive, exactly, would China have to be transparent — to act against its own totalitarian, paranoid, insular nature — if disclosure were guaranteed to result in its being sued by thousands of American claimants, whose lawyers would spread that information far and wide in civil complaints designed to frame its actions in the worst possible light?The precedent would be terrible in another way, too. Sovereign immunity protects American officials from even How much would the rogue regimes in China, Russia, and Iran love a world in which the United States, the defender of the international order, undermined the basic protections of that order? How much would they exploit the implicit invitation to use the kangaroo courts of their vassals as a weapon against the West? No one should know better than Senator McSally, a heroic veteran Air Force officer and combat pilot, that if sovereign immunity were eroded, American operatives who act in American interests overseas would be vulnerable to foreign prosecution. Their ability to travel internationally would be paralyzed by the threat of arrest.No nation is more active on the world stage than the United States. No nation, then, has more interest in upholding the doctrine of sovereign immunity than ours. We are deeply involved in overt military operations and covert intelligence operations; our diplomatic officers, as well as our other appointed and elected officials, play a decisive role in policies that dramatically affect people in other countries, mostly for the good, but sometimes for ill, including lethal ill. Sovereign immunity from liability in court proceedings prevents American officials and operatives from being hauled into foreign courts, ensuring that disputes among foreign powers are handled diplomatically.  
     
   And then there is the reciprocity problem.We quite intentionally insulate our courts from this political role. The judiciary’s duty is not to safeguard the public; it is to ensure that parties in court cases are afforded the law’s due-process safeguards. A bill that makes the judiciary responsible for responding to and punishing China over the COVID-19 disaster is a bill that takes that responsibility away from the political branches where it rightfully resides, and gives it to the non-political branch charged with protecting China’s rights as a litigant. That would not be most Americans’ idea of justice.Making lawsuits the response to foreign provocations also distorts governmental responsibilities. The courts do not have a national-security function. In our system, the defense of the nation is committed to the political branches that are accountable to the American people whose lives are at stake. It is the president and Congress who are supposed to deal with provocations by foreign powers, using diplomatic, military, intelligence, and other government capabilities to seek accommodations — including any monetary compensation for victims of willful or accidental harms.In the interim, the enemy has hit us again and again, realizing it has relative immunity: We’re relying on lawsuits while its hierarchy orchestrates forcible attacks from overseas safe havens, outside the jurisdiction of our police and courts. As I recounted in Such proceedings are an exquisite way for a government to choreograph the appearance of action — arrests (cum press conference vows to bring our foes “to justice”) followed by indictments (more press conferences), hearings, long trials, and harsh sentences. The months turn into years of media coverage. It can make a few mostly low-level defendants look like a caliph’s army. People may not notice that we’ve actually hauled into court only a handful of foreign operatives, all of whom the enemy has long since replaced as it continues its hostile operations.This approach emboldened our enemies. It told them that we lacked the will for combat, intelligence activities, and governmental seizures of territory and treasure. We were content, instead, with the simulacrum of national defense: high-profile court proceedings that, far from posing a meaningful deterrent, encouraged more attacks.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Great powers should never pretend that national-security challenges are mere litigation matters. Throughout the Clinton and Obama years, Republicans rightly argued that Democratic administrations were recklessly treating international terrorist organizations, aided and abetted by hostile foreign governments, as if they were just a crime problem. Most prominently, al-Qaeda considered itself at war with the United States, projecting force on a par with a nation’s and mass-murdering Americans. Yet, our government treated it as if it could be quelled by indictments, subpoenas, asset forfeitures, and other legal maneuvers — court cases in which the murderous group enjoyed the presumption of innocence, assistance of counsel, copious discovery of government intelligence files, and so on.This is foolish on so many levels it is tough to know where to begin.Sounds ferocious, right? Except no American victim would actually get compensation, because Beijing would, of course, ignore the lawsuits . . . except to exploit them as a (further) excuse not to cooperate with American and foreign investigations; as a further basis not to honor its treaty obligations; as a reason to step up its aggression in the Far East; and as a rationale for retaliating by encouraging other countries to strip sovereign immunity from the United States, so that our nation and officials may be sued and indicted for harms real and imagined abroad.Senators Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) and Martha McSally (R., Ariz.) are the latest to try this tactic, proposing a <span class=""drop"">S</span>

But having a proper understanding of the virus’s past and present danger matters. Knowing that it is extremely unlikely that the threat will be gone once the first wave passes will help guide the government, businesses, and individuals to take precautions that will limit the virus’s death toll in the months to come.

Despite the rapidity with which the coronavirus has killed tens of thousands of Americans, some on the right have continued to argue that the pandemic will end up being no more serious than a bad flu season. On Fox News last week, Bill Bennett said that “we’re going to have fewer fatalities from this than from the flu.” He pointed to the fact that the IMHE model from the University of Washington estimated that COVID-19 would most likely kill about 60,000 Americans and that the seasonal flu killed 61,000 Americans in 2017–18, a particularly bad flu season.<script async="""" charset=""utf-8"" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script>— Ari Schulman (@AriSchulman) New from the Why ""it's not as bad as flu"" — or car crashes or the 1957 pandemic — is not credible.Last week As for the new coronavirus?

Doing so is in our interest, so long as China remains integrated so deeply in the global economy.Hong Kong’s incredible success as a society and economy of its own depended on autonomy from Beijing and the inherited political culture left from its days within the British Empire. For the first years of its post-1997 relationship with China, little Hong Kong made up a substantial fraction of China’s total wealth. Hong Kong is still very prosperous and is a luxury shopping destination for many mainlanders.

					© 2020 National Review				Please choose a reason below:Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.Please choose a reason below:“Satisfaction” (1965), with its parenthetical prefix (“Can’t Get No”), might have been a better fit for TV if the Stones had not aged into self-parody and if Global Citizen were honest about their activist-agitation. (The lines “I went down to the demonstration / To get my fair share of abuse” belong to Sixties risk-taking; they don’t reflect today’s privileged, self-righteous pseudo-activism, which the media always defends as “largely peaceful.”) The Rolling Stones can’t avoid reducing everything to sex, while Global Citizen reduces everything to politics. Trump’s pop-music choice challenges them all.  
   Progressive activists such as Global Citizen and its naïve patrons fool themselves with all manner of pop-music placebo. Now that they represent mainstream establishment media, they’ve lost the counterculture impetus that once gave the Stones their impact. (No longer rebels, they act as shills for the WHO, even joining the wretched Gaga, Swift, and John Legend in obedient self-isolation.) The Stones’ former persuasiveness works for a different segment of the pop audience — the ones whose hopes were denied by previous political deception, whose most desperate longings are embodied by a figure now grasping the Stones catalogue and who might ensure the promise of their signature song, “Satisfaction.”The Stones typically view the world through sex (erotic rhythm being the foundation of their appeal, as in the imperishable “Brown Sugar”). They rarely make political music — “Gimme Shelter” and “Street Fighting Man” are exceptions — and they acknowledge religion even less. The London Bach Choir’s backing vocals on the original recording of “You Can Always Get What You Want” added gospel irony to the song’s druggy escapism so that the song commented on the solipsism of its era. (Now it also comments on today’s opioid crisis.) This majestic song takes a listener from pragmatism to catharsis to transcendence. (“Born in the U.S.A.” and Rockin’ in the Free World” are just propaganda — leftist jingoism.) But for Global Citizen, the pared-down, acoustic performance for TV was so pseudo-folky that Jagger’s lyrical tendency to seldom look beyond himself indicated that the Left can use the song only disingenuously and petulantly.Here’s where President Trump’s steadfastness pays off. His shrewd choice of that Rolling Stones theme discredited juvenile rock-star tantrums and also forced Jagger to realize the song’s enormous cultural application. It’s not only a greater song than any made by those Global Citizen lemmings Gaga, Beyoncé, John Legend, and Taylor Swift, but Trump’s new political application of it has opened up the process of artistic and political reasoning — the common sense that had calcified since “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” was first released in 1969. Although its title suggests another example of the blues-borrowed idiom that makes Jagger seem as learned as Leadbelly, Slim Harpo, or Muddy Waters, its advice — and sense of lived experience — are more than faddish. That song, a drug addict’s plangent paean, gave uniquely uplifting, even sobering, benediction to the social turmoil of the Vietnam era; it served as epilogue after the harrowing, pitiless “Gimme Shelter” that was prologue on the album This grown-up response to rock ’n’ roll hegemony counters the childish griping by performers such as Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen (and Jagger when pressed), who balk at their songs being utilized by conservative politicians.

By choosing one of the Stones’ non-libidinous songs for the occasion, Jagger managed to get primetime recognition alongside Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, and other Millennial acts on the progressive bandwagon while also shouting out to President Trump — straddling the fence as Jagger always has.The 50-year-old tune predates the birth of Global Citizen’s mostly youthful membership, the Gen-Xers and Millennials who are seduced by the kumbaya notion of globalism without questioning its endorsement by the United Nations or the WHO’s mishandling of COVID-19 data. The lack of such skepticism means the Singer Mick Jagger appeared solo, guitar-strapped, to introduce the song as his band mates appeared via individual, socially distanced panels — a Keith Richards cam, a Charlie Watts cam, a Ronnie Wood cam. “Here’s one I hope you know,” Jagger said, slyly banking on nostalgia.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

For starters, as far as we know, no athletes who participated in the games in Wuhan have been diagnosed with coronavirus — and that’s not the sort of information that could be easily suppressed simultaneously by lots of militaries around the world. The timeline doesn’t fit, even with lengthy incubation period. And even if the Chinese military did want to set off some sort of terrible bioweapons attack on the militaries of the world, there would be no way to ensure they didn’t get exactly the kind of disaster that befell their own country and civilians.

In addition to military personnel from the United States, the games in Wuhan hosted military personnel from almost all of the NATO countries, South Korea, bordering countries like Russia, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar, Vietnam, and quite a few countries in Africa, where the local health-care systems would be terribly unprepared for a threat on the scale of SARS-CoV-2. If SARS-CoV-2 had quietly spread among the military personnel at the games in Wuhan before they returned, the host country could have set off a health crisis in the ranks of military forces all around the world.The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 — the amount of time between the initial infection and the onset of symptoms — can range anywhere from two to eleven days, (Also note these researchers concluded, “the human SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, which is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID‐19, did not come directly from pangolins.” To summarize a lot of writing in the past month, the “lab accident” theory is extremely unlikely if the virus had to jump through pangolins, and more possible (but far from proven) if it could jump directly from bats.)<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.25731"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">One research paper by a group of virologists</a>It is worth noting that as seen with the California news above, the more the world studies the coronavirus, the more it realizes what it thought it knew wasn’t necessarily true.

The fact that Whitmer refuses to distinguish between the two reveals how indefensible her position is.“We stopped elective surgeries here in Michigan,” Whitmer replied. “Some people have tried to say that that type of a procedure [abortion] is considered the same, and that’s ridiculous. A woman’s health care, her whole future, her ability to decide if and when she starts a family is not an election. It is a fundamental to her life. It is life-sustaining, and it’s something that government should not be getting in the middle of.”On April 16, Whitmer was a guest on David Axelrod’s podcast “The Axe Files,” and Axelrod asked for her opinion on state efforts to limit abortions in order to conserve medical resources during the pandemic.The Republican speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, for instance, has noted that while buying seeds for your garden is banned, marijuana dispensaries in the state remain open. In an interview last week, meanwhile, Whitmer gave conservative opponents another reason to question her leadership by defending her choice to allow elective abortions to proceed.Aside from the aspects of the order that clearly seem to be unnecessary overreach, Whitmer’s policies are particularly troubling because of the disparity between the relatively innocuous things she has banned and some of the activities she has allowed to continue.Writing yesterday in the Her order has also prevented big-box stores from selling some home-improvement products, forbidden Michiganders from traveling within the state to their second homes, limited the use of motorboats, and closed golf courses.

This latest legislative effort, useful and necessary though it is, suggests that Congress and the administration are still behind the curve. That needs to change, and fast.We are at a dark and difficult hinge-moment in our struggle against this virus. It does look like some parts of our country may be reaching the peak of this initial outbreak, but that means we are living through a very difficult phase. About 15,000 Americans have died from this virus in just the past week. And yet it is precisely now that we need to be thinking about how to start returning to work.Treatments that could make the worst cases of COVID-19 much less bad are really the only plausible near-term game-changers. They would dramatically transform how we think about and deal with the virus, and make it much easier for us to live with it until a vaccine is available. Since living with it until a vaccine is available needs to be the goal of the policy response at this point, advancing treatment options needs much greater emphasis from policymakers. Getting to an effective treatment this summer rather than next winter, for instance, would make a difference on a scale that we can barely fathom. This calls for more than just including a vague reference to “treatment” on a list of things HHS can do with a paltry sum it is granted in this bill.But there is a role for government in enabling the mobilization required for that to happen quickly. The National Institutes of Health, in particular, is well positioned to break down some of the barriers to cooperative innovation posed by the usual protocols of corporate, academic, and public medical research. The agency even already has the statutory authority to take on that role — That effort would also require a much more intense and urgent focus on the development of treatment options for COVID-19. A vaccine is probably a year or more away, but treatment that makes the worst cases less bad need not be nearly so far away. And America’s uniquely capable pharmaceutical R&D enterprise, made possible by our uniquely commercial and innovative health sector, is likely to be where such progress comes from. China’s rigid and repressive regime has inflicted this nightmare on the world through its unwillingness to acknowledge the scope of the problem early on, and America’s innovative and creative society will end this nightmare for the world through its capacity for scientific and technological ingenuity.There are a variety of plausible frameworks out there, and they are pretty similar to one another. My AEI colleague Scott Gottlieb and a team of other public-health experts have proposed That effort would require, first of all, a much greater investment in testing, tracing, and containment. This has become increasingly clear; it is basically the view of everyone who has looked at it. And given that this bill actually does fund testing, it is hard to imagine why it does not fund far more of it, and why it makes no effort to establish some framework for a massive mobilization of testing to enable a gradual return to work.The bill going through Congress this week patches up the effort to sustain the hard pause, but it does awfully little to help the effort to enable the soft start.That holding out can be sustained by massive government support for a short time, but there is no way to keep the economy on hold with such support in the medium term. The government can’t actually substitute for the economy. And so we need to gradually restart what is paused, but to do it in a way that moderates the risk of the virus and makes it possible for us to live with it while the fight to end it continues.The “hard pause, soft start” view of the purpose of intense social-distancing policies is not an ex post facto redefinition but has at least implicitly been the aim of these policies throughout the five or six weeks since they were broadly enacted. (And it has sometimes been made explicit too; The “debates” we are having over lockdowns and liberation right now are mostly a distraction from this process. The people involved in them paint their opponents as either calling for long-term lockdowns until a vaccine comes or treating the virus as just another seasonal flu and demanding a sudden, total end to the national mobilization to respond to it. It doesn’t help that the president can be found embodying both caricatures at different times, as the obligations of governing and the pleasures of cynical populist politics compete to define his crude conception of a job he has managed not to understand even after three years of doing it. The fact is that almost no one really holds either of those two views, and those few who express them seem to do it mostly to strike a pose.We need to do that not because the pause was a mistake but because it is necessarily temporary. Its purpose is not to wait out the virus but to help the health system avoid being utterly overwhelmed and to enable our society to live with the virus relatively safely while our biomedical enterprise finds the most effective ways to fight and beat it. The balance of safety and activity required to do that could not have been achieved by gradually ramping down from normal life, because the risks involved would have been too great and in the process we would likely have overwhelmed the health system in many places. So it needs to be achieved by gradually ramping up from a near-shutdown of social and economic life that lets us get through the peak of this first wave of the pandemic and prepare the resources needed for the ramp-up. We have achieved that shutdown, we are beginning to reach that peak in some places, and we need to be preparing ourselves for that ramp-up.A month ago, the basic question was how to make a hard economic pause sustainable for a time while mobilizing to respond to the peak of the crisis. That’s what the CARES Act sought to help do, and it has helped. That question is still with us of course, but by now we are also necessarily asking ourselves how to effect the gradual soft start that needs to follow the hard pause.On the whole, it would be fair to say this bill is necessary but far from sufficient. It’s necessary because the needs it sets out to address are very real and the funding it provides will be useful. It is far from sufficient not so much because it doesn’t provide enough money to meet these needs (although in the cases of both economic relief and testing it is grossly insufficient on that front too) but because the broader understanding of the problem to be solved that is implicit in the bill is dangerously behind the curve. The bill is basically conceived as a patch to the CARES Act, which was enacted on March 27 — nearly a month ago. And in the national catastrophe we’re living through, a month is a very long time.The bill’s main purpose is to “top up” the Paycheck Protection Program enacted in last month’s CARES Act to help small businesses stay afloat. The $350 billion appropriated for that program have been spent in just a few weeks, and this bill adds another $320 billion and adds a little bit more structure to the program’s design. It then appropriates $75 billion to support hospitals in this emergency — reimbursing expenses related to COVID-19 and making up some lost revenue. And it provides another $25 billion for testing needs, including money to the states and to HHS to support research, manufacturing, deployment, and administration of testing.The National ReviewFollow Us",0,The Phase Three-and-a-Half Bill

While abortion providers, in challenging Texas’s policy, asserted that medication abortion doesn’t require personal protective equipment, the Fifth Circuit judges on Monday determined that those providers had failed to show that PPE wouldn’t be required at least for examining a woman seeking such an abortion.“The constitutional right to abortion does not include the right to the abortion method of the woman’s (or the physician’s) choice,” the majority opinion said.Last week, the same court allowed the state’s temporary restriction on surgical abortions to remain in place but temporarily blocked the policy limiting medication abortions while it considered whether it is constitutional. According to the two judges on the panel who ruled in favor of Texas earlier this week, the district court that had struck down the policy was wrong to treat medical abortion as an “absolute right.”In a decision on Monday, a panel of three judges on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Texas may be permitted to prohibit medication abortions as part of an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and conserve medical resources.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Fifth Circuit Allows Texas to Restrict Elective Abortions during COVID-19 Crisis

More lawsuit protection means more and faster reopenings, but also reduces incentives for workplaces to protect workers and customers from infection. Given the enormous economic and social importance of getting America back to work, however, the rules for filing such lawsuits should not be left to the courts to work out after the fact, with businesses stuck guessing what will happen and possibly overcompensating by staying closed. Lawmakers should lead the way.  
   Lawsuit protection need not completely abolish lawsuits or legal safeguards. There are five ways to provide protection and guidance for decisions to reopen. The strongest protection would be an absolute bar of the sort given to vaccine makers, possibly coupled (as in that case) with a public fund for compensating those who get sick as a result. The second approach would be a rule-based safe harbor protecting any institution that follows a specific, measurable list of safety precautions from being sued. The third approach would create a permission-based safe harbor that protects any workplace that gets a green light to reopen from government authorities, perhaps after an inspection. The fourth, narrowest approach would be the creation of rules limiting the evidence that could be used against defendants (e.g. preventing the use of evidence that a neighboring school made a different choice). The fifth approach would be to eliminate certain categories of damages (e.g. barring people from suing over fear of infection or infections that did not lead to serious illness). Whatever path is taken, the key will be making the protection afforded clear enough that it can be planned around, and ensuring that it does not require extensive litigation before it kicks in.There is precedent for a legislative response to this problem. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act protects vaccine manufacturers from liability in order to encourage vaccine research, while providing a compensation system for people injured by vaccines. Gun manufacturers are protected from liability for shootings, on the basis of a legislative judgment that the blame for misuse of guns lies with the shooter. A variety of other laws offer safe harbors to protect businesses that comply with certain requirements or receive federal regulatory approvals. Some would object that this is government interference, but   
   <strong><em>Safe Harbors</em></strong>Others, however, do. Cruise ships have faced The plaintiffs’ bar is already circling workplaces and schools; two class-action firms have <strong><em>The Lawsuits Have Already Started</em></strong>What about factories? The outbreaks at Smithfield meat-packing plants led to charges that the company had not provided adequately for employee safety from the virus, and the plants have lately been shutting down despite being classified as essential food-producing businesses under state laws. For factories, plants, or shipping hubs, it is not unreasonable for the state to require some enhanced safety procedures during a pandemic. But social distancing will be impossible for a lot of factories without huge, expensive renovations or massive reductions in the workforce on duty.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Consider the colleges. Cal State Fullerton has In making that decision, they are almost certainly going to talk to their lawyers and worry about legal risk. They will be told that they have some defenses, particularly if they can claim they were relying on the guidance of government leaders and public-health experts. Public schools may have additional defenses based on their status as government entities. Cruise ships are protected by federal laws limiting certain liabilities for deaths on the high seas. Still, uncertainty will linger. Small businesses such as barber shops and nail salons are less likely to have lawyers handy for consultation.The chief reason to act in advance to head off civil lawsuits is to avoid the danger that businesses, schools, and other institutions will be excessively cautious and risk-averse in reopening when it is in society’s interests for them to do so. Right now, many institutions are shut down by direct order of the government; others closed voluntarily before government orders were issued, or have closed without being required to do so. Eventually, government restrictions will relax, and that will leave business leaders, school administrators, church leaders, sports-team owners, and others with decisions about when it is safe to open up again.

There is precedent for using commercial activities exemption of the FSIA, such as in the 1992 Supreme Court case “[This] is the commercial activities exception,” Schmitt explained. “So, if you’re operating a [negligent] virology lab, if you’re hoarding PPE…you no longer have those protections. So we believe that those common law claims that we have fit squarely within that exception, which is why we think we’ll ultimately be successful…to the tune of tens of billions of dollars.” Those damages could be sought from Chinese entities within the U.S.“Our claim, which I think people are starting to understand is a little bit different than what people might have thought it was, is that we believe those allegations fit squarely in an exception to the Federal Sovereign Immunities Act that would typically give immunity to other nations,” Schmitt said in an interview with The suit claims that these entities were negligent in attempting to contain the initial outbreak in Wuhan, and that they deceived the international community as to the prevalence of the outbreak.

					© 2020 National Review				Our Capital Letter email newsletter delivers a weekly digest on finance, business, and economics from an NR sensibility.Oh.If the euro fails . . . Europe fails too, [and so does] the idea of European unification. We have a common currency, but no common political and economic union. And this is exactly what we must change. To achieve this, therein lies the opportunity of this crisis.By contrast, Macron was relatively restrained when he explained to his FT interviewers that “we need financial transfers and solidarity, if only so that Europe holds on.” Neither he nor Merkel were the first to claim that a euro crisis threatened the existence of the EU itself, but Macron’s words were intended to play on fears within the Frugal Four that the stakes were too high for them not to cave in. They will be unlikely to yield to the pressure to agree to the issuance of euro bonds in the near future, as is evident from the way that the importance of Thursday’s EU leadership teleconference has been downgraded, but there is every reason to think that they will eventually succumb to Macron’s dodgy logic. After all, The Euro allegedly has a part to play in keeping the demons of the past at bay. There are those today who want to scrap the supranational idea. They want the European Union to go back to the old purely intergovernmental way of doing things. . . . Those people should come to Terezín and see where that old road leads.Whenever the EU finds itself in a mess, its more excitable leaders like to warn that its implosion would signal a The first part of that passage is characteristically disingenuous. The institutions that evolved into the EU were conceived as part of a grand political project from the very beginning. The economic was always subordinate to the political. It was a motor of integration, a means rather than an end, the cheese on the mousetrap. There are few better examples of that subordination than the creation of the euro, which risked economic disaster for no obvious economic advantage but, politically, looked like a gamble worth taking. Such was the brutality of that perverse logic, it still does: If the only way to save the single currency from the flaws built into its design were even deeper EU integration, the euro zone’s trauma would, to use the entertainingly cynical language of European construction, have constituted a “We are at a moment of truth, which is to decide whether the European Union is a political project or just a market project. I think it’s a political project. . . . We need financial transfers and solidarity, if only so that Europe holds on.None of this appears to worry Macron, possibly because he hopes that France would not fare too badly in any fiscal union, and certainly because of his anxiety over what might lie ahead for the EU:The Frugal Four know that a fiscal union will send a flow of cash from the euro zone’s “north” to some of its poorer nations Establishing a currency union without the backing of some sort of fiscal union was always asking for trouble. If, say, Tennessee falls on hard times, it will pay less to, and receive more from, the Feds. There is no need to devalue a Tennessee dollar to maintain the state’s ability to compete, because the American currency union is supported by a fiscal union. But trapped in the euro, Italy cannot devalue itself back into competitiveness, and there is no ‘federal’ euro-zone authority presiding over taxing and spending to ease its pain. It is not difficult to understand this absence. Tennesseans, Texans, and even New Yorkers feel a national affinity — and thus have a degree of willingness to help each other out — that Finns, Greeks, and Portuguese do not.<span>NOW WATCH:</span>He’s talking about If Macron gets his way, those hands will soon be rifling through the wallets of the euro zone’s “Frugal Four” (Austria, Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands), who are currently holding out against the sort of “solidarity” that he has in mind — namely, “financial aid funded by mutualized debt.”[He is] especially concerned about the EU and the euro. Banging the desk repeatedly with his hands to emphasize his points, he says both the union and the single currency will be threatened if the richer members, such as Germany and the Netherlands, do not show more solidarity with the pandemic-stricken nations of southern Europe.Under the circumstances, then, it is no surprise that, when it comes to Brussels’s embattled union, Macron, like many EU leaders, has learnt little from the debacles of the last couple of decades:Macron is also not the first eco-warrior to have noticed that the measures taken to contain COVID-19 might make a useful precedent for the struggle against climate change. People, he reckons, have come to understand “that no one hesitates to make very profound, brutal choices when it’s a matter of saving lives. It’s the same for climate risk.” The parallel is nonsense, but typical of that strand of environmentalism in which coercion is a feature, not a bug.In his view, the interviewers report, COVID-19 represents an opportunity to put an end to the “hyper-financialized world,” a phantom that exists mainly in the fevered imaginations of communitarians, academics who refer to “late capitalism,” and European politicians. (Recall that, shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, an earlier French president, Nicolas Sarkozy — seemingly oblivious to the political and economic developments of the previous hundred years — They are right, but unfortunately, Macron’s ideas are old ideas, if sometimes repackaged.Macron’s humility only goes so far, and will not have been encouraged by his starstruck interviewers, who write that he is “overtly intellectual [and] always brimming with ideas.”I don’t know if we are at the beginning or the middle of this crisis — no one knows. . . . There is lots of uncertainty and that should make us very humble.<span class=""drop"">A</span>

Unlike most states, California has had long delays in processing test results. We’ll be watching the rate of testing this week as an indicator of how quickly states will be able to reopen their economies.Just over 2,100 coronavirus patients died in the U.S. yesterday, down from 2,600 Tuesday. While the past two days have seen an increase in deaths nationally, New York, the hardest-hit state, reported declining numbers of new deaths.The number of new cases per day has hovered around 27,000 since last week. Yesterday, 27,219 patients received COVID-19 diagnoses. The plateau in new cases reflects the fact that the U.S. is at the apparent peak of the current outbreak. However, the path forward remains perilous, as reopening the economy could spur a wave of new cases.More than 830,000 cases of coronavirus have now been confirmed in the U.S., with the death toll surpassing 42,000. The pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the economy, with 4.4 million workers filing for unemployment Thursday, bringing the total number of jobless claims to more than 26 million.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Coronavirus Update: Reported Tests Spike as California Clears Backlog

Earlier this week, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Texas in one such case, allowing the state’s restriction on unnecessary procedures to include both surgical abortions and medication abortions, the latter of which are performed earlier in pregnancy. In the case of Arkansas, courts have ruled that the prohibition on surgical abortions may stand, but the prohibition on medication abortions may not.The opinion from the Eighth Circuit on Wednesday stated that the federal judge in question had “usurped the functions of the state government by second-guessing the state’s policy choices” and noted that Arkansas was within its rights to limit surgical abortions as part of its broader effort to stop the spread of disease and conserve medical supplies for necessary procedures and emergencies.In a ruling yesterday, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that Arkansas may restrict most surgical abortions as part of its prohibition on elective procedures during the COVID-19 outbreak. Earlier this month, a federal judge had temporarily blocked the policy and ruled that the state could not lawfully restrict abortions as part of its overall order.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Eighth Circuit Allows Arkansas COVID-19 Abortion Restriction to Stand

Very strong views about policy and political philosophy. But, frankly, I think I feel even more strongly that we should have leaders — left, right, or center — who are not liars.

I’m talking about bald-faced liars.• I have a covid comment: When your friends die of the disease, and people point out that they had problems anyway — they were old, they were sick — that is not exactly great consolation, do you know what I mean? A lot of it is whistling past the graveyard, in my opinion.Anyway, gripping, and horrible.  
   It’s about two North Korean fishermen, seeking asylum in the South, but sent back to the North, to their certain execution. They killed the captain of their ship — and about 16 others, with hammers and axes. Why?• One last thing. This is about Mairead, not the late Betty. On the day those children were buried — Mairead’s nephews and niece — Mairead took roses from their grave and presented them to the mother of Danny Lennon, the IRA driver of that fleeing car, which struck the Maguires.Whatever we think of Williams and Maguire in these last decades . . . they did something noble in that summer of ’76, after the death of those three children. and they were very, very brave. Here were two women, going on nothing but nerve, telling the IRA to lay down their arms. The IRA might have killed them for that — they killed for less. And they certainly threatened the women and their followers. Undaunted, the women went to America, to tell the Irish Americans to stop sending money to the IRA. The IRA might have killed them for that, too. Possibly, the Nobel prize, when it came, protected the women, making the gunmen think it unwise to target them — unwise from a PR point of view. The women were called traitors, turncoats, British spies, worse. They persisted, crying against violence and urging peace.But, oh, were they brave, those two. Incredibly so. Let me quote again, please:Mairead Corrigan Maguire was pretty much of the same mind.In 2006, she told schoolchildren in Brisbane, “I have a very hard time with this word ‘nonviolence,’ because I don’t believe that I am nonviolent. Right now, I would love to kill George Bush. I don’t know how I ever got a Nobel Peace Prize, because when I see children die, the anger in me is just beyond belief.” She made a similar statement the next year, in Dallas. “Right now, I could kill George Bush, no problem. No, I don’t mean that. I mean, how could you nonviolently kill somebody? I would love to be able to do that.”There is so much more to say, but I’ll continue for just a little longer. Betty Williams was not always lovable, at least by me. She hated George W. Bush, for the Iraq War, in particular.In 1980, Anne Maguire, unable to live with her torment, killed herself. As Corrigan told it in a speech, Anne left a note saying, “Forgive me. I can’t go on. I love you.” Corrigan went to care for the remaining Maguire children, and in 1981 married their father, her former brother-in-law. She is known today as Mairead Corrigan Maguire.A little more:This group grew into a larger community, a movement.A witness to the horrible event was Williams. In the following days, she got together with Corrigan, a sister of Anne Maguire and an aunt of those children. They formed a group called Women for Peace.What does that have to do with Betty and Mairead?Their prize comes with a tragic story. On August 10, 1976, Anne Maguire was out walking with four of her children. There had been a shootout between the IRA and the British army. Driving a fleeing car, an IRA man was shot through the head. The car crashed into the Maguire family, killing two of the children instantly and claiming a third later. Their mother was badly injured. Of the dead children, the youngest was six weeks, and the others were two years and eight.I wrote about Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan in She won the Nobel Peace Prize for 1976, along with Mairead Corrigan. They were peace activists in Northern Ireland. Betty was 33 and Mairead 32. Previously, the youngest Nobel peace laureate had been Martin Luther King, age 35. (Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani heroine, was a co-laureate in 2014, when she was 17. There will never be a younger winner, almost surely. Those circumstances were very peculiar.)• I was interested to see an Anyway . . .In 2010, Obama mispronounced “corpsman,” making it come out “corpse-man.” We had a field day. Some people said it showed Obama’s unfitness to lead our mighty military.Still: What if Obama or some other Democrat said that? Can you imagine our reaction? The reaction of the Right? I can.We all make slips of the tongue, even if most of us don’t make them in important presidential statements, related to war. Obviously, you don’t shoot down boats, you shoot down planes. But we’re all human.I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea.• One more tweet, from the president of the United States. On Wednesday, he wrote,(Some people say I spend too much time on language, and care about it too much, and care too much about how people express themselves, especially people in leadership positions. They should have known Bill Buckley. Ho, mama. They wouldn’t have liked him It is the job of Trump-’splainers to ’splain, and I wish they would ’splain me this: Why those quotation marks? Those quotation marks around “dumb” and “Speaker”?Nervous Nancy is an inherently “dumb” person. She wasted all of her time on the Impeachment Hoax. She will be overthrown, either by inside or out, just like her last time as “Speaker”.• Feel like another Trump tweet? He does not leave us with a shortage. Several days ago, he wrote,Feelings about “Dr.” are bound up in that bitch-goddess, Status. (Yes, I know: James said Success. But Status is a sister.) The best line in either Austin Powers movie belongs to Dr. Evil, who, when addressed as “Mr.,” says, “I didn’t spend six years in evil medical school to be called ‘Mr.,’ thank you very much!” Our senior editor Jeffrey Hart, professor emeritus of English at Dartmouth, remembers serving as a campaign adviser to Nixon (not that this is necessarily a segue from evil). To Jeff’s amusement, Nixon called him “Dr. Hart.” This accords with the Nixon we know: class-conscious, status-nervous, chip-on-the-shouldery, the boy from Whittier who received a tuition scholarship to Harvard but couldn’t go, because the family didn’t have the money to transport him to and from Massachusetts. Nixon, according to Jeff, would also say, “I’m no Ph.D., but . . .,” before launching into a disquisition on some arcane topic.Let me quote one paragraph from that piece, if you don’t mind, just because it’s kind of interesting:I don’t believe I’ve ever had more responses to a piece than I did in 2002, when I published “Maybe Trump would like to have a word with Fox (as he likes to do) . . .<span>NOW WATCH: </span><span class=""small_caps"">National Review</span>According to legend, the In any case, the convention of the newspaper is to say “President” on first reference and “Mr.” thereafter.

I am not a medical professional and wouldn’t hazard a guess as to what’s going on physiologically. There are some new Here’s another stereotype to retire: the one about blacks as mail carriers and train conductors. The 
Some have suggested that because African Americans are more likely to hold service jobs and interact with the public, they are more at risk. This is somewhat true. Only 20 percent of African Americans in a recent There is little dispute that African Americans have higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease than do whites, Hispanics, or Asians, and those underlying health conditions leave them more vulnerable to various other diseases. But that doesn’t answer the question about COVID-19, or the flu for that matter. The 2009 H1N1 epidemic, for example, affected all ethnic groups similarly. In 2010, the CDC Many reports on racial disparities in deaths from the new virus have unfortunately traded in stereotypes. African Americans are portrayed as largely poor and urban. That’s not the case. In 2018, the black A number of reports have also pointed to higher rates of asthma among African Americans as possibly predisposing them to complications from COVID-19, which seems plausible. But, again, the numbers are surprisingly modest. The Office of Minority Health at the Health and Human Services department found in 2015 that the percentage of African-American adults with diagnosed asthma was 9.1 percent. The percentage among whites was 7.9 percent. On the other hand, the death rate was three times as high for blacks as whites for reasons unknown.

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span><strong>ADDENDUM</strong>Since the outbreak hit, I’m just less interested in what the political ramifications are, at least for now. I’m not interested in Do you see how this makes the usual “Can you believe President Trump said this?” coverage — or its reverse, “You won’t believe that this cable news figure said about Trump!” — seem irrelevant and unimportant? I’d say we have bigger fish to fry, but as you saw above, we can’t even get that fish to the market. We are in the middle of the biggest news story of the century, a problem that touches every single life on the planet and is a threat to just about everyone in one form or another — physically, mentally, economically, socially. And some people can’t break out of their politics-as-usual thinking patterns.Eat more potatoes, America.“It’s going to be a really bad situation in the fall. We just know there’s going to be a huge oversupply of potatoes. And when that happens, the price plummets and our growers can’t even recoup their cost of production,” Houlihan said.Tamas Houlihan, executive director of the Wisconsin Potato & Vegetable Growers Association, said about 60 percent of potatoes produced in the United States are processed for the food service industry. Without restaurants and schools to use up last year’s potatoes, Houlihan said there will be storage problems when the 2020 crop is harvested.We are really not prepared for the Lots of industries are going to find themselves in situations similar to the oil industry’s current troubles. Those who produce the initial form of the product keep generating it, while the processers and middlemen can’t find enough customers, either retail or wholesale. A backlog of supply builds up — and remember, meat, fish and produce can spoil, oil doesn’t — and then no one knows what to do with all the excess supply.“Seldom does a consumer go to a grocery store and want to buy a 5-pound bag of shredded cheese,” said Mark Stephenson, director of Dairy Policy Analysis at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. “They wanted maybe 1-pound bags at a time. You can’t just put 1-pound bags through a 5-pound line. Not possible. You have to have a different piece of equipment set up differently. We’ve had an industry that’s had to shuffle a great deal to move product from where it was produced before to where it needs to be today.”America’s food producers set up their supply chains to cater a certain percentage to restaurants and a certain percentage to supermarkets, and while you might think, “food is food,” “We may find that the food selection is reduced,” said Andrew Novakovic, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell’s Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management. “It’s fairly likely we’re going to be eating more canned foods and have less fresh fruits and vegetables available.”Americans may see less selection or more expensive food than they’re used to as well as a smaller variety of fresh fruit and vegetables. If independent farmers go out of business, some consumers may lose access to locally-produced food.In produce, farmers have seen It’s a Minnesota farmers are Americans aren’t necessarily going to starve, but we are probably going to see a lot less food on our store shelves in the next couple months as these problems in the supply chain get worked out. Tyson Foods <strong>This Is What We Ignore When We Obsess Over What’s Happening in Washington</strong>What’s more important and consequential right now? How about the U.S. food supply chain?Because the media and President Trump are in this well-established symbiotic relationship driven heavily by “YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT THE PRESIDENT JUST SAID” coverage, a lot of days the media act like the most important development in the coronavirus story is what the president said that day. But most days, that’s among the least important and consequential developments.Whether you love this president or hate him or fall somewhere in between, this is the guy we have in the Oval Office for, at minimum, the next nine months. (The meandering comments of President Trump’s Democratic alternative are not really an overflowing fountain of reassurance, either.)Look, in a matter of days, we have seen this president insist that the decision to reopen states is his because Elsewhere, the dominant message from the national media is variations of “President Trump is just the worst,” with I wish the president wouldn’t spitball half-baked ideas during these briefings, but “maybe you can, maybe you can’t” is not the same as declaring sunlight is a cure. But the media has a narrative, and it’s going to stick to it. Despite all the mockery last month, NBC News reports again, “Through several mechanisms, vitamin D can reduce risk of infections. Those mechanisms include inducing cathelicidins and defensins that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs, leading to pneumonia, as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several observational studies and clinical trials reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of influenza, whereas others did not. Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration.Once again, the president appears to be half-remembering accurate information and repeating it in a way that is inaccurate to the point of near-incoherency. When you go out in the sun, CNN writes, “As usual, the president is vaguely, sort of in the ballpark of a valid idea, and half-remembering it and describing it in way that sounds ridiculous. Columbia University’s Center for Radiological Research has In just about every major publication in the country today, the lead story is that President Trump has once again said something outrageous in yesterday’s briefing about the virus response. “So supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just a very powerful light — and I think you said that hasn’t been checked because of the testing” — referring to Bill Bryan, the acting undersecretary of science and technology for the Department of Homeland Security. “And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or some other way, and I think you said you’re going to test that, too. I see the disinfectant that knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs, it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.”<strong>Is It Really Too Much to Ask That We Focus, People?</strong>On the menu today: dissecting some recent comments from President Trump about coronavirus treatments, and why the latest “I can’t believe he said that!” comments in Washington are pretty small potatoes compared to much larger problems — such as the ability of American consumers to continue to have access to potatoes of any size.National ReviewFollow Us",0,"Eat More Potatoes, America"

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.(C) 2020 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY, LLCThat’s just one obvious example. There are far more unknown unknowns waiting for us in the years ahead, because we’re about to enter an era when every single American can start a conversation by asking “What did you do?” or “What happened to you when . . . ?”Consider immigration, which has roiled our politics for so long. Whatever your position is on the issue, the old equation has new variables. In a country with millions out of work, dismissing some work as “jobs Americans won’t do” may well sound offensive (and untrue) in ways it didn’t before. As agonizingly slow as the process already feels, it’s a sure bet that America and the developed world will emerge from the pandemic far sooner than poorer nations. Inviting immigrants from places where the virus is still thriving — regardless of whether you think it’s right or wrong — will simply have a very different political resonance than it did two months ago.Already, the economic calamity the pandemic has caused is guaranteed to blow up a lot of the comfortable assumptions that have defined the contours of our politics for the last two decades.Whether the lockdowns are warranted in every corner of the country is a different conversation. I think there are good arguments (and bad ones!) on both sides of those debates. But if everybody eventually knows somebody who has died, or nearly died, in this pandemic, the conversations to come are going to be very different.But that’s probably not going to last, particularly if the experts are right that we’ll see a major resurgence in the fall.How much of the political squabbling right now is attributable to the fact that many of the people protesting in relatively unscathed regions are still watching this pandemic unfold as an event on TV and not as a menace in their own lives? It’s understandable that if you don’t know anyone suffering from COVID-19 or helping those suffering from it, you might feel that stay-at-home orders are an overreaction.This pandemic is the first event in my life that approaches anything like that. And it’s going to get much more intense before it’s all over. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 59 percent of Americans don’t know anyone who has contracted COVID-19. A week prior, the same pollsters reported that 70 percent of Americans didn’t know anyone who’d been infected. If even the rosiest predictions are accurate, it won’t be long until every American knows someone who contracted the virus, and perhaps someone who died from it.The consequences of those shared experiences were profound, changing our politics and culture in countless ways.There’s a huge psychological difference between watching and participating, and I don’t think anyone is appreciating the difference. For decades after the Great Depression and World War II, the question wasn’t, “Where were you . . . ?” It was, “What did you do?” or, “What happened to you?” During World War I, not everybody served, but nearly everybody knew someone who did and felt the effects of war mobilization — the censorship, the hysteria, the rationing of food, etc.This isn’t to minimize the importance of those events or the emotional effect they had on society. The Cuban Missile Crisis directly involved a small number of players, but millions or even billions of people felt they had skin in the game.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Most historic events of the last half-century, even if significant and tragic, are remembered largely as moments on television. Despite the tendency of politicians to say, “If we can put a man on the moon . . . ,” the number of people among that “we” is only in the thousands. The rest of America experienced it vicariously on TV.The same goes for wars. Less than 1 percent of Americans are in the military, and less than 10 percent of the adult population has ever served. Even among those who wear a uniform, only a fraction see sustained combat.The 9/11 attacks were a huge event for most of us who were alive then. But how many lives did 9/11 directly and meaningfully affect, particularly outside New York and Washington? Not many in the grand scheme of things. (Hassles at airports don’t count.)The unstated thing about such questions is the assumption that you were a spectator of one kind or another when something momentous happened. And for most Americans, that’s how we experience historic events — as spectators.We’ve all asked this sort of question. Where were you when the planes hit the Twin Towers? Where were you when you heard JFK was shot? Where were you when you heard Kobe Bryant died?<span class=""drop"">‘W</span>

But to qualify for loan forgiveness, PPP requires that you hire them back. Owners have no idea, however, when they’ll be allowed to reopen. They also wonder if customers will be eager to come back. That means most restaurants can’t gamble on staffing back up to prepandemic levels.One reason is that many small restaurants don’t have relationships with big banks, in part because restaurants aren’t a high-receivables industry. This makes it more difficult to obtain funding. Many small banks were hesitant to get involved, fearing they’d be left holding the bag when funding ran out and large lenders prioritized their clients. Without capital to stay in business, owners are left to choose between firing their employees and furloughing them.Last week funding for the Payroll Protection Program dried up.

No charge.But perhaps the most interesting section of all was when Pew categorized the responses by religious group. In every religious group represented — Evangelical Protestant, mainline Protestant, historically black Protestant, and Catholic — a strong majority favored giving treatment priority to those most in need. Religiously unaffiliated Americans, meanwhile, went the other way, with only 41 percent favoring giving ventilators to those most in need compared with 56 percent who favored helping those most likely to recover.White respondents were evenly split on the question, with 48 percent in the “need them now” camp and 47 percent in the “most likely to recover” group. The views of black respondents were starkly different: An overwhelming majority (60 percent) favored giving ventilators to those most in need in the moment.There was a similar breakdown when Pew reviewed the data by economic level. A majority of “upper income” respondents (52 percent) favored giving ventilators to those most likely to recover, while a majority of “low income“ respondents (56 percent) favored giving them to those most in need in the moment. Republicans tended to favor treating those most in need (a 53–41 percent split) while Democrats went slightly in the opposite direction (47 percent for most in need versus 49 percent for those most likely to recover).Unsurprisingly, older Americans are far more in favor than younger Americans of giving ventilators to those who need them in the moment; it is older Americans, after all, who would most likely be given short shrift under the “give ventilators to patients most likely to recover” plan. Americans between the ages of 18-29 were the most likely of any category surveyed to favor giving ventilators to those most likely to recover (58 percent) compared with just 39 percent who favored helping those most in need.More interesting still, Pew released the responses for the same question broken down into categories by race, age, income level, party affiliation, and religious affiliation — and the results are fascinating.Overall, the public is about split on the question of which patients should receive a ventilator, if ventilators are in short supply: Fifty percent of respondents chose “patients who are most in need at the moment,” while 45 percent chose “patients who doctors think are most likely to recover with treatment.” It’s a tricky distinction, and one that more likely than not would come down to a question of whether the patient in question is elderly or has a preexisting condition, favoring those who are young and healthy.A National ReviewFollow Us",0,Poll: Religious and Non-Religious Americans Split on Ventilator Rationing

America’s endless culture war is the sort of thing in which rich and free countries engage with a spirit of leisure. Packer’s rant only proves how inadequate it is to the needs of the moment.Indeed, while much of the criticism leveled by Packer and others at the White House is true, their lamentation about American society is mostly false. Our bottom-up, federalist response to the virus is encouraging and showing results. Our partisan lines have blurred somewhat, if you look beyond Twitter: Colorado, governed by a Democrat, is easing restrictions early; some red states, such as Ohio, closed quickly and decisively. A supermajority of Americans that cuts across party lines supports the notion of staying home and Of course, there is much to criticize and lament in the American effort to fight the virus. President Trump’s mixed messages and relentless partisanship have made everything harder. The White House still lacks a clear vision for getting a sufficient test-and-trace regime together. And America has been slower to describe and educate the public on what it will look like to live with the virus between this initial phase of the crisis and its final abatement. But to one extent or another, these problems have plagued our peer nations in Europe, too, and it isn’t as if our response has been without its virtues.It’s actually easier to imagine a British version of Packer’s lament, but that would implicate the austerity policies of more fashionable Europhiles and Tory “modernizers” such as George Osborne and Philip Hammond, rather than the uncouth American right-wingers or the spendthrift populist Boris Johnson. The East Asian states that have done best in fighting COVID-19 are not social-democratic but hyper-capitalist. Compared with them — and to America —Western Europe has done much worse at containing the spread of the coronavirus and the holding down the death toll. Even the response of Germany, which has been praised so much for its competence, looks little different from that of, say, Oregon, or Texas, or even Florida.Packer’s piece depends on the belief in a fairy tale common to prosperous liberals, the myth of a government starved by the Reagan and Gingrich revolutions while more enlightened governments in Europe continued to grow their egalitarian public sectors. In fact, almost the opposite is true. Since the 1980s, as our nation has continued to age, the share of our citizens covered primarily by government entitlement programs has continued to increase, while European countries have tended to engage in privatizing reforms.
The United States “Fine,” you might say. “So the CDC is not evidence of a failed state. But what about the larger health-care system?” Well, there is much to complain about in the way the United States provisions and distributes health-care resources. But the underinvestment and underdevelopment that are characteristic of failed states are not remotely present here.This is just not true.

Given the damage that’s already been inflicted and the massive ratcheting up of the post-COVID-19 politicization of American economic life, my guess, and it’s only a guess, is that confidence will be slow to return and that the recovery from our economic nightmare will be gradual and uneven.Members of the Cambridge School of Economics, which was founded by Alfred Marshall (1842–1924), all concluded that fluctuations in business confidence are the essence of the business cycle. As John Maynard Keynes put it, “the state of confidence, as they term it, is a matter to which practical men pay the closest and most anxious attention.” That is, of course, why Keynes put great stress on changes in confidence and how they affected consumption and investment patterns. Frederick Lavington (1881–1927), a Fellow of Emmanuel College and the most orthodox of the Cambridge economists, went even further in his 1922 book Regardless of the particular economic problem being analyzed or the analytical apparatus used to diagnose it, confidence plays a critical role. Economists have long recognized the importance of confidence. Indeed, most economists find extremes hard to explain — either booms or busts — without reference to it. For example, the American economist Wesley Clair Mitchell (1874–1948) wove “business sentiment” into much of his pioneering work on business cycles. He was not alone.The University of Michigan released its Consumer Sentiment Index measurements today. Thanks to the sledgehammer lockdown of the U.S. economy, the index took its biggest one-month plunge ever recorded. When sizing up the health of the economy, it’s always important to gauge the public’s state of confidence.National ReviewFollow Us",0,U.S. Consumer Confidence Takes a Record Plunge

If government does that, it will show respect for civil liberties, it will propose more sensible restrictions, it will exhibit awareness that it is not our ruler but our servant, and it will win broad support for safety measures that are truly essential.No one wants to see infectious disease spread. No one wants to see the economy destroyed — and see all the attendant social, medical, and financial destruction that entails. We should not be in political combat over this. But we will be until we get the balance right. Government officials must grasp that they may not impose stifling restraints on liberty without convincing the public that these restraints are necessary, that no lesser restrictions will do, and that enforcement will not be arbitrary or discriminatory.This should not be a political issue. It is not politicized in court cases — everyone accepts that the rules are the rules. On that score, let’s remember that a significant majority of people charged in criminal cases are convicted, even though liberty is our default preference and the government bears the burden of proof. The rules are a boon for society. Because the government knows it can only succeed by persuading us, it works hard to marshal its evidence effectively. It does not presume to declare the case proved; it labors to prove the case. Because it does so, its restrictions on liberty, even when severe, enjoy broad public legitimacy.It is not enough for government officials, in reliance on experts, to tell you that they have very good public-health reasons to lock you down, remove your livelihood, deny your children access to education, and blockade your family from the use of outdoor spaces. Again, there is no question that government has a compelling interest in public safety. Nevertheless, before it restricts or denies our fundamental liberties, it has the burden of showing that its proposed restrictions are necessary, that there are no more modest measures that could better balance public safety with our right to live freely.Instead, because I was a government official seeking to infringe on my target’s precious right to privacy, constitutional principles codified in statutory law imposed on the government the burden of proof on two key questions: (a) did the evidence establish probable cause that a crime was being committed, and (b) was there no less intrusive way of getting incriminating evidence than monitoring the target’s private conversations? I had to satisfy the court that there was incriminating evidence that the government was entitled to obtain, and that there was really no less extreme tactic available that would allow the government to obtain that evidence while showing deference to the target’s fundamental rights.Many times in my years as a prosecutor, I had to seek wiretap warrants. It was not enough for me to tell the judge that I was a highly experienced criminal-law expert with years of investigating organized crime and racketeering enterprises under my belt. Indeed, my expertise never entered into the discussion.This is not the way it’s supposed to work.The problem with the counsel government officials are getting from medical doctors and other scientists is not that it is bad advice. It is that government officials seem to think they have the power to make it Attorney General Bill Barr did the nation and the cause of civil liberties a real service over these last days by mobilizing the Justice Department on the side of freedom. The AG’s admonition came down to the burden of proof: It is not an American’s burden to prove that his or her job is “essential” rather than “non-essential,” as some government official subjectively defines those terms; it is the Our justice system for resolving disputes and balancing essential interests is the envy of the world. The American people would revolt if someone tried to change it. Yet, somehow, when we transition out of the courthouse to the variety of other settings in which government officials presume to restrict our rights, we seem to forget these transcendent principles. In court, fact-finders are guided at every step of their deliberations by the burden of proof. Our abiding principle is that liberty may not be restricted unless the government first convinces us that it must be. Restrictions are not imposed just because a government official says they should be imposed. And when all the testimony is in, we don’t leave the decision to a panel of experts. Determinations about our most fundamental concerns are left to ordinary Americans — much as determinations in the political realm are left to officials democratically accountable to ordinary Americans, not to anointed experts. These decisions, whether in court or in politics, are not dictated solely by the scientists’ views; scientific evidence is respectfully given its due, but it is weighed along with other matters of consequence.As science and technology advance, they play an ever larger role in the outcome of criminal and civil litigation. But you know what? We don’t call off the trial or suspend the burden of proof when a distinguished scientist — even someone as undeniably impressive as Dr. Deborah Birx or Dr. Anthony Fauci — authoritatively proclaims a scientific conclusion. Each side of the controversy, the public-safety side and the liberty side, gets to examine the scientists and even summon their own scientific witnesses — whose contrary assessments are also subjected to cross-examination.No. At every key juncture, we admonish the public and every participant in the system that The argument from authority has no place in the justice system. We do not deprive an American of liberty just because highly experienced law-enforcement professionals explain that they are confident the law has been broken. We do not restrict movement and commerce, we do not impose fines and penalties, just because a respected scientist has a convincing theory — supported by carefully crafted models — about how the victim died, or about whether the suspect had the mental capacity to form criminal intent.The justice system powerfully illustrates the same dynamic that is playing out with COVID-19 restrictions that have locked down economic and social life. Day after day, the system pits the government’s compelling interest in public safety against our most fundamental freedoms — liberty, property, and, in capital cases, life itself.And that’s where the burden of proof comes in.This is not a radical concept. No matter what anyone tells you, it is not a conservative-versus-liberal thing, not Republican-versus-Democrat or Trump-versus-Anti-Trump. It is a basic, indisputable fact. It plays out every day in the justice system, which we use to resolve many of society’s most significant controversies.This does not mean that expertise, in particular the mastery of science, is insignificant. It is critical. But it does not have declarative authority. Expertise is not right because it says so. It is there to help us, not order us. It has to compete. It has to convince. And unless it does, it should have no power to infringe on our liberties.
In our society, the argument from authority should never be the final word, notwithstanding the progressive vision of government by bureaucracies of purportedly agenda-free experts.In the United States, authority is subordinate to liberty. Government is the servant, not the master.There is no doubt that governments have a compelling interest in public safety, which includes preventing the spread of a potentially deadly infectious disease. It is nevertheless the foundational conceit of the American republic that governments are created to secure the fundamental rights of a nation’s citizens — our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Moreover, the legitimacy of government is dependent on the consent of the governed.And it will keep doing damage unless and until we restore the burden of proof.The politicization of science has ingrained in our political life something about which we ought to be highly skeptical: The argument from authority. It is doing extraordinary damage to the republic, through governmental responses — federal, state and municipal — to the coronavirus.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

It happened on <strong>Baseballery</strong>Again, do order your pre-publication (May 19) copy of Now it is our job to help President Trump save civilization in the twenty-first century.Churchill did save civilization in the twentieth century.Nick Adams has done a service for all of us and for future generations by tying together the leadership capabilities and moral commitment of these two great men.Since the left was on the verge of destroying America as it has been and replacing it with a radical America, their frenzy at the defeat of 2016 is even greater.These are the kind of changes that drive the left crazy and make Trump their mortal enemy.Trump’s strategic genius (a point Nick Adams makes clear) is in understanding that he wants to effect permanent change toward judges who want to enforce the law. The result has been a principle that all district court judges have to be under fifty years of age. The result is going to be at least a full generation of more constitutionally compliant judges.The success of the Trump-McConnell team in getting 161 federal judges approved (as of the date I am writing, still more are in process) is a mortal threat to the most effective strategy the left has had. For two generations the left has developed weird un-American left wing ideas and then used unelected judges to impose them so the power of the government was coercing the American people into change.President Trump has been attacked and battered twenty times as much as President Reagan was because he is a mortal threat to the left.The very seriousness of the current cultural civil war can be seen in the 92 percent hostile coverage in the major media. The three years of unending and dishonest investigations. The guerrilla war being waged by permanent civil servants especially in the Justice Department and the national security apparatus.President Trump is a much greater defender of Western civilization than his predecessor because he is in a much more difficult situation. In many ways the crisis of the West that Trump confronts is much like Britain after the disastrous withdrawal at Dunkirk.However President Reagan did not wage the cultural war with the left, which meant that we defeated communism in Moscow but lost to it on campuses. The continuing drift to the left was barely slowed by the Reagan administration and not affected at all by the two Bush administrations.Reagan was a great president (I campaigned with him and for him in the 1970s and as a member of Congress worked with him in the 1980s and based the Contract with America in 1994 on Reagan’s ideas). He had an enormous impact on the world and was the key person forcing the collapse of the Soviet Union (it is impossible to imagine a reelected President Jimmy Carter leading to the end of the Soviet Union).If Churchill is obvious as a champion of Western civilization, the case for President Donald Trump is a little more challenging, but in the end I think it holds up.My dear pal Nick Adams, an American born by mistake in Australia, frequent Fox guest, the founder of <strong>The Churchill / Trump Nexis</strong>3. Kat Timpf and Katie Yoder chat about why it’s OK to feel bad and off during the lockdown. 2. John Stossel takes on coronavirus overreach. 1. Dennis Prager interviews the great Paul Johnson. <strong><em>Lights, Camera, Action!</em></strong>His replies have been characteristically adamant. He has extolled his administration’s performance on the measures that are unarguably federal jurisdictions—restricting foreign travel, deploying the military’s medical resources, mobilizing production of materials in short supply and allocating them among states and cities, providing information on the spread of the virus and guidance on mitigation measures. He has been jealous of federal prerogatives and sharply critical of governors and business executives he regarded as uncooperative.Mr. Trump has received criticism from all sides for these measured responses. It is said, on the one hand, that he should aggressively commandeer state police powers and industrial resources to mount a uniform national response—and, on the other (sometimes by the same critics), that the crisis will sooner or later unleash the authoritarian ambitions Mr. Trump has supposedly been harboring all along.Until now. In responding to the coronavirus, the Trump administration has confined itself to longstanding statutory authorities that have been invoked routinely in responding to lesser emergencies. President Trump has used the Stafford Act of 1988 to provide states with emergency financial assistance—but has deferred to their decisions regarding social confinement, business closures, testing and treatment. He has employed the Defense Production Act of 1950 to cajole manufactures to prioritize urgently needed medical equipment—but has relied primarily on consultation, coordination and publicity to coach a private-sector-led mobilization. He has declared a national emergency under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, which can potentially trigger extraordinary regulatory powers—but so far he has used it only for deregulatory purposes, waiving Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act rules that restrict telemedicine and interstate medical practice.It is not only crises that propel the administrative state. Lesser events of the 2000s—accounting scandals and a spike in energy prices—also led to new layers of freewheeling federal power. But major emergencies have unfailingly been major inflection points.In response to the 2008 crisis, the administration arranged corporate mergers and bailouts with only fig leaves of statutory authority. It spent hundreds of billions of dollars without congressional appropriation. These crisis expedients provided the template for the Obama administration’s unilateral responses to mere political frustrations—congressional inaction on its climate change, immigration and other legislative proposals. At the same time, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 commissioned an army of new regulatory authorities with unprecedented discretion and autonomy.BONUS: At theThe first two pages focus on “gender microaggressions” and appear to have been compiled internally at UNH from various internet sources.

No Joking: At For decades, China has been working on its three-pronged strategy: building its economy and fighting capability, including intelligence, technology, cyber and space as well as hard military power; developing global influence to exploit resources and secure control; thrusting back and dividing the US and its capitalist allies.Those who argue China’s right to compete with the West in free markets and on a level playing field seem not to comprehend that Beijing has no free market and no intention of playing on a level field. The world’s leading China today is by far the greatest threat to Western values, freedom, economy, industry, communications and technology. It threatens our very way of life. China’s objective is to push back against the US and become the Like 9/11, Covid-19 must now force the West to wake up and fight back.5. Gatestone Institute’s Richard Kemp sees the coronavirus pandemic as a 9/11 moment for the West, which has long ignored China’s intentions. Moreover, while De Vries greatly improved at scene construction and plotting through the course of his career, he never really excelled at either. What he offered readers in place of these skills was extraordinary wit and cleverness, roguish charm and vivacity, and a graceful style. Those attributes were buttressed by lightness of touch, imagination, and a measure of humanity.This was especially true of his early books De Vries didn’t have this quality. Born and raised in Chicago, he spent much of his working life in and around New York. But the flavor of neither city is in his work. Nor are the people. Like so many of his generation, he moved to the suburbs to raise a family with his wife, Katinka. But Westport, Connecticut—the town in which he lived much of his adult life—turns up only fleetingly in his fiction. Instead, his novels frequently engage in various forms of parody. They are sometimes as much about literature as they are about social currents and trends and the corruption and glamour of modern America.It must be admitted, too, that De Vries had several large defects as a writer of fiction. Somerset Maugham once said that novelists had to be extroverts. I think Maugham meant by this that novelists need to have a basic enthusiasm for the world and the people in it, one that inspires them to go out and investigate their subjects. In that sense, Tom Wolfe was the post-war American writer most suited to carrying on and inheriting the novelistic legacy of Dickens and Balzac.4. In the new issue of Only in the past century have cities ceased to be killing fields. A boy born in Shakespeare’s London or Edith Wharton’s New York City could expect to live six years less than a boy born in the countryside. Water-borne illnesses, like cholera and typhoid, killed thousands until cities spent massively on water systems. Mosquitoes carried yellow fever and malaria. Diseases that travel by droplet, including smallpox and influenza—and now Covid-19—prove particularly hard to disrupt, without a vaccine.One millennium later, another plague struck Constantinople and ended the emperor Justinian’s attempt to rebuild the glory of Rome. Justinian’s plague was the first recorded mass appearance of But density and connection to the outside world— the defining characteristics of great cities—can also turn deadly. Plague struck Athens in 430 BC, when its citizens were packed more closely together than usual because they were avoiding the Spartan army. Thucydides, who caught the disease and recovered, claimed that it originated in Ethiopia and passed through Egypt. The plague killed tens of thousands, including Pericles, and probably led to Athens’s defeat in the Peloponnesian War and eclipse as a great metropolis.3. At The problem with this myth is that it is not true. When confronting slavery, racism, and the exclusion of women from the ministry, the dominant strain of Methodism actually In the current disagreements about same-sex marriage and the ordination of “self-avowed practicing homosexuals,” progressive leaders frequently appeal to a myth of progress in American Methodism. The argument goes like this: Methodism used to read the Bible in a way that supported racism and slavery and prevented the ordination of women. But eventually we realized that the Bible was wrong about those ­issues—or at least, that how we interpreted the Bible on those issues was wrong. The prohibition of same-sex marriage is the next link in the chain of injustice that we need to break. We have been using the Bible to discriminate against gays and lesbians, it is argued, and need to progress in the same way that we aligned ourselves with God’s justice in opposition to slavery and the subordination of women.One can certainly say that the United Methodist Church is a failed experiment in theological pluralism. But that line of analysis does not go back in history far enough. The mistakes made at the founding of the UMC were largely predictable based on previous developments, for the history of Methodism in America is one of conflict over cultural accommodation.2. At The party’s efforts to exert control inside China are far better known than its parallel efforts beyond China’s borders. Here again, insecurity and ambition are mutually reinforcing. Chinese leaders aim to put in place a modern-day version of the tributary system that Chinese emperors used to establish authority over vassal states. Under that system, kingdoms could trade and enjoy peace with the Chinese empire in return for submission. Chinese leaders are not shy about asserting this ambition. In 2010, China’s foreign minister matter-of-factly told his counterparts at a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations: “China is a big country, and you are small countries.” China intends to establish a new tributary system through a massive effort organized under three overlapping policies, carrying the names “Made in China 2025,” “Belt and Road Initiative,” and “Military-Civil Fusion.”Party leaders have accelerated the construction of an unprecedented surveillance state. For the 1.4 billion Chinese people, government propaganda on television and elsewhere is a seamless part of everyday life. Universities have cracked down on teaching that explains “Western liberal” concepts of individual rights, freedom of expression, representative government, and the rule of law. Students in universities and high schools must take lessons in “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism With Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.” The chairman’s 14-point philosophy is the subject of the most popular app in China, which requires users to sign in with their cellphone number and real name before they can earn study points by reading articles, writing comments, and taking multiple-choice tests. A system of personal “social credit scores” is based on tracking people’s online and other activity to determine their friendliness to Chinese government priorities. Peoples’ scores determine eligibility for loans, government employment, housing, transportation benefits, and more.As China pursues its strategy of co-option, coercion, and concealment, its authoritarian interventions have become ubiquitous. Inside China, the party’s tolerance for free expression and dissent is minimal, to put it mildly. The repressive and manipulative policies in Tibet, with its Buddhist majority, are well known. The Catholic Church and, in particular, the fast-growing Protestant religions are of deep concern to Xi and the party. Protestant Churches have proved difficult to control, because of their diversity and decentralization, and the party has forcefully removed crosses from the tops of church buildings and even demolished some buildings to set an example. Last year, Beijing’s effort to tighten its grip on Hong Kong sparked sustained protests that continued into 2020—protests that Chinese leaders blamed on foreigners, as they typically do. In Xinjiang, in northwestern China, where ethnic Uighurs mainly practice Islam, the party has forced at least 1 million people into concentration camps. (The government denies this, but last year 1.

(Nothing here matches the gospel documentary By turning the Clark Sisters into victims, the biopic becomes one more saga about women oppressed by envious, authoritarian men, plus the stigma of conservative religion. You’d never know from this film that matriarch Mattie Moss Clark (played by actress Aunjanue Ellis) was an esteemed, innovative choral arranger driven by religious conviction to change the style of musical gospel’s powerful invocation. She conducted the Southwest Michigan State Choir, made popular through its Savoy-label albums that preserved the spiritual thrust of sanctified music like no other gospel recordings — a power and vibrancy unmatched by such mainstream gospel icons as The Staple Singers who won acclaim as offshoots of secular folk music.It dramatizes how five young women from Detroit, whose mother honed their singing and musical skills, found success in the 1980s. Director Christine Swanson and writer Camille Tucker treat the Clark Sisters like Broadway and Hollywood’s 18. Armond White has a lot to say about the Lifetime biopic In his view, the interviewers report, COVID-19 represents an opportunity to put an end to the “hyper-financialized world,” a phantom that exists mainly in the fevered imaginations of communitarians, academics who refer to “late capitalism,” and European politicians. (Recall that, shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, an earlier French president, Nicolas Sarkozy — seemingly oblivious to the political and economic developments of the previous hundred years — They are right, but unfortunately, Macron’s ideas are old ideas, if sometimes repackaged.Macron’s humility only goes so far, and will not have been encouraged by his starstruck interviewers, who write that he is “overtly intellectual [and] always brimming with ideas.”<em>I don’t know if we are at the beginning or the middle of this crisis — no one knows. . . . There is lots of uncertainty and that should make us very humble.</em>At the end of last week, the 17. Andrew Stuttaford tells of Emanuel Macron leading France with a major recycling effort . . . of bad, old ideas. That’s what raises the broader problem that makes this more than just a quibble about the posturing of Plenty of other outlets have followed suit and parroted China’s bunk. NPR touted China’s claim that “a majority of cases originated abroad.” Bloomberg declared that “China’s virus cases reach zero.” NBC ran a piece entitled “As U.S. struggles, China asserts itself as global leader.”Yet the very day after American news media were kicked out of the country, March 18, the Americans would also be right to wonder why more journalists aren’t pursuing a story about China that appears to tick every box in an investigative reporter’s dream assignment. Here we have an ultra-secretive police state that won’t even let its own citizens use Facebook. They put ethnic minorities in concentration camps. The first doctors who sounded the alarm about the virus were forced to recant at gunpoint. Gee, do you think maybe all that is worth a closer look?16. Ken Langone argues that the public needs to trust journalists, a trust that American journalists are making extra efforts to undermine by carrying water for Communist China. We learned in the 2008 financial crisis that too many Americans do not need to be encouraged not to make their mortgage payments; for a substantial portion of the population, when some economic calculus suggested not paying their mortgage (generally because the value of the home was lower than the debt on the home), far too many were quite comfortable breaching contract and not making payment. In chapter 4 of my book By not requiring basic documentation and support, the government has made the claim of hardship and appeal of forbearance irresistible. The number of borrowers claiming this right under the CARES Act However, where such legitimate need exists, the actual codification that I do understand that included in those with “Federally backed mortgage loans” (these include loans sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Housing Administration, so roughly 65 percent of all American mortgages) are some who would genuinely and perhaps even desperately need mortgage forbearance. Even after the direct infusions to American taxpayers, the unemployment-benefits premium, and the support to small business via the Paycheck Protection Program, there will surely be some whose economic circumstances would make servicing their mortgage painful. My guess is that that number is quite low, net of all other support and programs, but I acknowledge existence of that need and concern.15. Mortgage relief language in the CARES Act is seriously flawed, says David Bahnsen. Okay, urban life is addictive. And I won’t be the one to deny the pleasure of walking around a big city, strolling through gardens where nature is under control and the ground is freshly vacuumed, going into a shopping center and coming out with a bunch of bags full of books and clothes, or spending hours drinking liters of beer in some pub with the music blaring and surrounded by pretty girls. I’m just trying to say that if this way of life collapses, even just a bit, the city will cease to be a liberation and could turn into a crazy prison full of depressed people wearing muzzles and gloves, walking around yesterday’s promenades like zombies among “For Sale” signs and shrouded in dense melancholy.For centuries, the countryside economy was based on The chances of a plague or a meteorological disaster ruining your harvest and your economy and emptying your pantry are much greater in the countryside — before the appearance of this pandemic, at least — and that has resulted in country folk cultivating gratitude, humility, and faith. In the countryside, they respect nature even more than ecologists from Stockholm, no matter how much the latter congratulate themselves on crossing the Atlantic in a non-motorized catamaran. On the other hand, a humble outlook results in farmers having great respect for tradition, seeing it as a source of wisdom, experience, and a moral beacon.A return to the countryside doesn’t just mean changing where we work. In rural life our ancestors cultivated a much healthier family life than we do today. The family, the larger the better, is the cornerstone of life in the countryside. Things work because there is an authority, the hierarchy is obeyed, which also means that elders are respected above all. Many hands and teamwork are needed, and that’s incompatible with the anthropological selfishness inherent in digital leisure.14. Does the countryside beckon? In the Age of Coronavirus, Itxu Díaz can be found idolizing the idyll. But the bad news is that the world has its share of lunatics who don’t worry about those kinds of consequences. In 1984, the followers of  So that creates something of a deterrent factor in the use of bioweapons, along with the U.S. policymakers’ past Of course, bioweapons are particularly dangerous, and the world’s experience with this virus is making the risks of bioweapons vivid and unmistakable. Once a virus is released, it doesn’t follow orders, and a virus rarely stays on the side of the border that a government wants. Even if a regime was certain that its responsibility for unleashing a virus would never be discovered, they would run a considerable risk of a virus spreading into its own society and inflicting damage comparable to the target country.If you asked me what worries me today — and what is 13. Jim Geraghty reflects: Are we looking at the future of bioterrorism? As it is, VOA reminds observers of a media playground where there’s too little supervision. That lack of structure often leads to serious management snafus, such as when Sasha Gong, the head of VOA’s Mandarin service, and two of her colleagues were The charter of VOA declares that it “will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.” Some of its programming must by that standard take the form of a broadcast “editorial page” that lets America’s friends and foes know what Washington is doing and why. Yet staff of VOA’s policy office, which produces editorials, has been cut by some 50 percent. In 2008, Jeffrey Trimble, the staff director of the Broadcasting Board of Governors that oversaw VOA at the time, actually claimed, “Documentary filmmaker Michael Pack has seen more than 15 of his films broadcast on PBS, which has exacting professional standards. He has pledged that if confirmed as CEO, he will insist on the independence of VOA. But he’s been denied a confirmation vote because of foot-dragging and spurious conflict-of-interest allegations by Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Its chairman, Idaho GOP senator James Risch, has so far been unwilling to call time and hold a vote.President Trump’s anger stems in part from the fact that his nominee for CEO of the Agency for Global Media (which runs VOA) has been in limbo for 22 months.12.

In a reductionist sense, this crisis could have been avoided if the Chinese had a Jeffersonian and Madisonian Bill of Rights, and a population protected by it. Nations of the European Union would have done better to one another in this crisis if they’d had a little humility and settled for a confederation of like, but still disparate, democracies and the idiosyncrasies that accompany them — rather than constructing an impossible utopian nightmarish edifice like something out of the old silent movie Does the First Amendment in some sense explain why, when you walk into the supermarket, you see crazy shoppers wearing over their face everything from weird motorcycle-helmet visors and dinner napkins to bandanas, embroidered doilies, silk scarves, used N-95 masks, hospital wraps worn lengthways, and (in the case of one well-meaning nut) a mask worn under the nose? In China, crowds all appear as if they are equipped by “CCP Approved Mask Model #1” of identical shape and color.Authoritarians and petty fascists, eager to issue endless edicts, molt their exoskeletons, as if under their chrysalis suits they were always caudillos, waiting to be reborn with sunglasses and epaulettes. But a free and empowered people, even in times of mortal danger, long nursed on a Bill of Rights, is hard to subjugate or shut up, even after over a month spent locked up in their homes. Thank God, we have a Constitution quite different from those of European nations, which are themselves far superior to other alternatives.No one quite knows the limits of Washington, D.C., or the parameters of federalism. The schizophrenic Left now tends to favor the neo-Confederate idea of federal nullification when it’s a matter of sanctuary cities or abortion laws or opposing anything Trump is for. But at least there is tension there, and that uncertainty itself can limit the power of both a president and a governor. And that’s not always a bad thing when the mentality of the mob takes over.10. Victor Davis Hanson is thankful, in the face of rising authoritarianism, that Americans have, and cherish, their Bill of Rights. While I’ve long defended the right of social-media companies to dictate and enforce their own speech codes as they please without any interference from politicians, it’s difficult to give Facebook the benefit of the doubt here. Government has some leeway in protecting public health, but it has no right, not even during an emergency, to work to preemptively prevent Americans from expressing their political beliefs. If Facebook removed advertisements for protests at the behest of state and local governments — as initial reports suggested it might have — it would be an clear assault on expression, made all the more appalling by the fact that the protests were aimed at the very public policy that allows the state to undercut the ability of citizens to organize a demonstration in the first place. But even if Facebook was merely working with such governments to decide what millions of Americans can say to each other, that would be a big problem for both philosophical and practical reasons.There is Meanwhile, Facebook is reportedly removing the posts of those organizing anti-quarantine protests in conjunction with state governments, calling them “harmful misinformation.”9.

Holthaus is absolutely correct that implementing a plan like the Green New Deal would hold approximately the same gruesome economic consequences as the coronavirus crisis — except, of course, forever.

But in their stunt, that role was reserved for Harry and Meghan themselves, who are simultaneously continuing their role as victims of the tabloid press.Since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, announced earlier this year that they would be “stepping back” from their role as senior royals, they have dogged the headlines.

Indeed, the report says right up front, in the findings section, that the intelligence agencies, over the FBI’s objection, did not include information from the infamous Steele dossier in its December 30, 2016, assessment on Russian interference — though, “as a compromise to the FBI insistence,” dossier allegations were included in an annex to the assessment. The Senate-report findings do not get into why the FBI was pushing so hard on the preposterous dossier. Nor do they mention that, by the time of the assessment, the bureau had already heavily relied on the dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant from the FISA court, and was even then preparing a submission to get yet another warrant — telling the federal judges the bureau believed that the Trump campaign was conspiring with the Kremlin.The real question is whether the Obama administration and its officials held over by the new administration fabricated a tale about the Trump campaign’s 5.

It’s important, Bartholet tells us, “that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints.” Democratic values?

Surfers and bikers are the least of our worries. Yet, there is a segment of American opinion that takes it as its responsibility to scold and shame anyone who dares go out and get a little fresh air.None of these activities has been shown to be a vector for the spread of COVID-19; in fact, no outdoor activities have been shown to be dangerous at all. A recent study examined hundreds of outbreaks and traced only one to an outdoor environment.As the CNN report put it: “The scene at Jacksonville Beach wasn’t one of caution in the middle of a worldwide pandemic. Crowds cheered and flooded the beach when police took the barriers down. People were seen swimming, biking, surfing, running and fishing.”The largest city in Florida partly reopened its beaches, and it became something of a national scandal.

This also meant that much of the press coverage get it exactly backward. The media portrayed as an inherent failure the fact that the administration gave states a portion of their requests. (“Trump sent Arizona a fraction of the ventilators it sought,” a And this is the key thing: The strategy was based on Another important realization was that FEMA could do just-in-time delivery. It could get states and hospitals ventilators within 24 or 48 hours. This created a lot of flexibility. The administration could wait to see how things really played out rather than making decisions based on models that forecast what the demand might be two weeks in the future. “When you started looking at it like that,” the official says, “the numbers went down dramatically.”A data team drawn from various government agencies and at the White House was created to get to the truth on the ground. It used hospital billings at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to estimate how many ventilators were in each state and how many were being utilized on any day, giving administration officials a more granular picture of what was happening in states than many governors had themselves.It became clear that many governors didn’t know how many ventilators their states had, and they were driven by early models that were “doomsday scenarios,” as one senior administration official puts it. Governors were also acting on the normal impulse to want to be safe, and have more than enough ventilators on hand, just in case. “If you are a governor, which is natural, you are going to over-ask because you want to be over-prepared,” the official explains.1.

No charge.Jedrzej Nowicki/ Agencja Gazeta via ReutersA priest stands inside the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary and of St. Joseph, virtually deserted amid coronavirus concerns, in Warsaw, Poland, March 15, 2020.AdvertisementHolding religious services outdoors obviously isn’t a perfect solution. There is a lot more space in small towns and suburbia than in large cities, and thunderstorms or extreme heat could cancel services. But, with the proper precautions, it still seems like a better and safer alternative than holding services indoors at greatly diminished capacity.Asked about allowing religious services outdoors, former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said it could be a good idea if proper social distancing were maintained. “I believe the first things governors will try to restart are some outdoor activities that give us a sense of normalcy. Allowing religious services to take place outdoors with proper social distancing could be a very attractive and appropriate proposal along those lines,” Gottlieb tells The virus A better alternative could be holding religious services in wide-open spaces outdoors.But even if congregants don’t sing, holding religious services indoors at 20 percent capacity presents a problem, which is that an awful lot of people will not be allowed to attend. Who wants to have a bouncer outside a house of worship?The members of the choir used hand sanitizer, avoided physical contact with one another, and tried to maintain distance from one another. “Nearly three weeks later, 45 have been diagnosed with In Washington state on March 10, after residents were aware of and worried about a coronavirus outbreak in the state, 60 members of a Presbyterian church gathered for choir rehearsal practice.
Still, there are some big problems with Carney’s proposal. First, we are still learning about how the coronavirus is spread, and it’s not clear that church in an enclosed environment will be safe even with a greatly reduced number of people in attendance.There is some precedent for what Carney proposes. When the Spanish flu hit the United States, the city of Milwaukee had the lowest fatality rate of any major city in America. Although the city shut down its churches during its first outbreak of Spanish flu, churches in Milwaukee were allowed to operate at 50 percent of their normal capacity during the second wave.Carney proposed that houses of worship be subject to the same occupancy restrictions as retailers: “For instance, in North Carolina, big retailers are allowed to have far more than 10 people in their stores.

No charge.In 1975, as Ronald Reagan left the governor’s office in California and was looking back on his time managing the state, he spoke to a student audience about nuclear power. “I note that an overly excited group of Californians has formed something called People for Proof,” to crusade for a risk-free future, he said. He warned that “But the rest of the world has chosen the lockdown path, and I fear the upper hand belongs to those who wish to reduce the risk of infection regardless of the high associated costs to the overall health or society.In Sweden, in line with national traditions and the culture there, scientists rather than politicians take the lead and establish pandemic policy. Swedish scientists also take responsibility for their decisions and speak honestly of tradeoffs. Johan Giesecke, the country’s former chief epidemiologist, bluntly said on Swedish radio recently that harsh lockdowns make little sense and that it’s the rest of the world that’s conducting an experiment in lockdowns based on shaky models. In Sweden, people are encouraged to stay home, but stores, restaurants, and offices remain open. “Better to have social distancing people can live with for months than severe lockdowns that get reimposed if cases rise once they are lifted,” Giesecke said.  
   “The thing elected officials fear most is social stigma from challenging the conventional wisdom,” Colorado state senator Vicki Meeker told me.  
   Our politicians also face new pressures that their counterparts in 1968 didn’t. Susan Craddock, professor at the Institute for Global Studies at the University of Minnesota, told the Joel Hay, a professor of pharmaceutical economics and policy at the University of Southern California, told me that the role of science has also changed. Medical technology has vastly improved from a time when people still did computations on slide rules. But the data it produces has seduced some into thinking that we know more than we actually do and that we can produce useful models to predict the course of this novel coronavirus disease. “We’re being bombarded with data, but we often act like the guy who looks for his keys under the lamppost because the light is better there,” he told me. “We aren’t asking more fundamental questions, like ‘Does this $20 trillion experiment in lockdowns actually work?’”The global response to COVID-19 couldn’t stand in starker contrast. Leaders have made the decision to do everything possible, including bringing entire economies to a crashing halt, to limit the loss of life. They’ve swept aside considerations of the negative health effects of locking people inside with a virus that spreads most virulently indoors. People who’ve been denied nonemergency surgeries are expected to comply and shut up about their pain, even though some will undoubtedly die from their conditions.Philip Snashall, a now retired professor of medicine, wrote in the Marilyn Brown worked at the Los Angeles Department of Social Services during the Hong Kong flu. “Other than my coworkers bringing their own alcohol to wipe down their desks and wipe down pencils and not use pencils that clients had used, we didn’t do anything,” she recently told During the Hong Kong flu, Americans rode buses less often, washed their hands, and practiced social distancing. But they went to work.We were more resilient then, there were no helicopter parents, and we were brought up in an era when it wasn’t unknown to get chicken pox, measles, mumps, German measles, or scarlet fever. Polio had haunted people’s nightmares until a vaccine was developed in the mid-1950s. Senate majority leader It amazes me now, but I was able to give my oral report in class because the schools didn’t close in California — or anywhere else in the country. Shawn Steel, now a California attorney, remembers attending a Grateful Dead concert in December 1968 at the Shrine Auditorium at the University of Southern California.I am just old enough to remember the Hong Kong flu. Like the majority of those infected, I didn’t get sick. But my family lived down the road from Travis Air Force Base in the Bay Area, the main return point for soldiers coming home from Vietnam in the fall of 1968. Living near the place of that flu’s first contact piqued my interest, and I recall preparing a school report on the virus.The Centers for Disease Control reports that it killed more than 1 million people worldwide, more than 100,000 of them in the U.S. Luckily, a vaccine was developed early — in August 1969. But the Hong Kong flu is still with us as a seasonal malady.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Hundreds of thousands were hospitalized in the U.S. as the disease hit all 50 states by Christmas 1968. Like COVID-19, It was fatal primarily to people older than 65 with preexisting conditions.Just how much so can be seen if we look back at how the U.S. — and indeed the world — handled the now largely forgotten All of this has combined to create an unprecedented public-policy response. For the first time in history, we’ve effectively quarantined the healthy population while also practicing social distancing and protecting the old, vulnerable, and frail. Even public-health experts such as Doctors Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx admit that an economic lockdown is an untried and untested theory.We’re living through a new crisis in which a highly virulent virus arrives at the very moment when ubiquitous media coverage, global interconnectivity, and a certain amount of scientific conformity amplify everything.<span class=""drop"">W</span>

With fewer hospitalizations nationally, the mortality rate should continue to decline modestly.With more testing comes more confirmed cases: More than 40,000 patients tested positive on Saturday alone, the largest single-day increase. However, that number dipped on Sunday, and the positive rate has declined from a consistent rate of 20 percent to 17.6 percent as of Sunday.That appears to be changing. At the rate of the past few days, the U.S. has roughly doubled its testing capacity since last week. With 1.5 million tests reported last week, the U.S. has passed former More than 550,000 tests were administered in the U.S. this past weekend, marking a turning point in the fight against the coronavirus. The first phase of the domestic outbreak was characterized by severe testing constraints, due in large part to tainted CDC testing kits and onerous FDA regulations barring private labs from developing tests. Since the FDA allowed private labs to diagnose the virus in late February, the U.S. has struggled to reach the testing capacity required to roll back economic shutdowns and physical-distancing measures.National ReviewFollow Us",0,U.S. Turning the Corner on Coronavirus Testing

If the media want to know why their reputation is at an all-time low, Kate Smith is Exhibit A.Earlier this month, Smith tweeted this gem: “Writing up the new Texas abortion news and watching Little Fires Everywhere and of course there’s an abortion subplot. I can’t escape this beat!”Imagine for a moment that CBS — or NBC or ABC or CNN — employed a reporter who described her beat as covering “the killing of unborn children,” who openly shared her pro-life convictions while treating statements from pro-choice groups and lawmakers as automatically dubious. Imagine a mainstream reporter who spent the bulk of her time interviewing the president of the March for Life or taking thinly veiled shots at the blue-state lawmakers who seek to remove any possible restrictions on abortion. Such a journalist would be laughed out of the room — by the very same people who treat Smith’s work as objective reporting.Smith’s Twitter account routinely hosts insinuations masquerading as facts — “Restrictions on abortion always disproportionately impact people of color” — and solicitations of sources who will substantiate the pro-abortion argument she’s already decided to make: “Are you a patient in Texas seeking an abortion but can’t get one because of the state’s ban? Please reach out to me, I would love to speak with you. State officials in Texas have told me that people **aren’t** traveling out-of-state to get abortions, but I know that’s not true.”Her latest projects have been on such challenging topics as hosting a chat with the makers of the documentary film glorifying Jackson, Mississippi’s last abortion clinic and repeatedly tweeting updates about which states are facing lawsuits for limiting abortion during COVID-19.But the push for the legislation began, as its sponsor Ben Sasse clearly articulated, in response to comments from Virginia governor Ralph Northam, who had said in January 2019 that he favored allowing doctors and mothers decide whether or not to care for infants born alive after an attempted abortion, at least in some circumstances. The born-alive bill, then, was not an example of GOP debate-shifting but a response to Democratic extremism; Smith, of course, had little choice but to ignore that fact entirely.Smith attempted to frame the bill as evidence of “a push by the conservative right to reframe the reproductive rights debate toward third-trimester abortions.” (Note her use of “reproductive rights,” another phrase that, like “abortion access,” is used only by those who champion unlimited legal abortion.) Later in the article Smith repeated herself: “The push for the legislation is part of an ongoing attempt by Republicans to shift the debate on reproductive rights to focus on so-called late-term abortions.”  
   In February 2019, she produced perhaps the best example of the media’s disinformation campaign against the born-alive bill. Her headline inexplicably placed both “born-alive” and “late-term” [abortion] in scare quotes — a practice Smith adopts every time she uses these phrases — and somehow devolved from there. She alleged that the bill “echoed existing laws and medical practices” and “mirror[ed] previously passed legislation from 2002” when in fact there is no existing federal legislation, including the 2002 bill, that mandates medical care for infants born alive after attempted abortion procedures.  
   Though the bill doesn’t restrict abortion procedures in any way, it draws attention to the fact that botched abortions produce living infants, a reality that is particularly challenging to the narrative of abortion advocates. Naturally, Smith was on the scene to help them spin away the more unpleasant aspects of opposing the bill, chiefly by promoting falsehoods about the bill itself and the motivations of its sponsors.Perhaps the best example of Smith’s inability to cover abortion with anything approximating neutrality has been her effort to report on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. The GOP-led legislation would require doctors to provide the same level of medical care to any infant who survives an abortion procedure as they would to any other infant delivered at the same gestational age.More recently, Smith offered the same treatment in an exclusive, uncritical interview with Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, providing her with a platform to expound on her organization’s lawsuits against states that are attempting to limit unnecessary procedures, including elective abortion, during the coronavirus outbreak.It is hard to imagine how the interview would have gone any differently had it been a PR video crafted by Planned Parenthood itself to give its supporters a polished, inside look at the glamor and gloss of the nation’s largest abortion provider.When Alexis McGill-Johnson became acting president of Planned Parenthood last summer, her first public interview went to — who else? — Kate Smith, who opened their conversation with a broad smile and a hearty, “Congratulations on the new job!” Smith went on to pose such probing questions as “How did you first get involved with Planned Parenthood?” and “There are a lot of different ways that you can get involved with health-care access, especially for women of color, and especially low-income women. Why Planned Parenthood?”Earlier this month, she was the first to report that a “coalition of abortion rights groups” had responded to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals’ ruling in favor of Texas’s COVID-19 abortion restrictions. Her article noted that Texas was restricting “abortion access” and exclusively quoted pro-abortion activists, one from the Center for Reproductive Rights and one from NARAL Pro-Choice Texas.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Let’s review Smith’s most recent work, starting with her verbal virtuosity. She tends to hide her liberal beliefs about abortion in devious language, referring to herself, for instance, as a reporter covering “abortion access” — a euphemism wielded exclusively by the most vigorous activists for unlimited legal abortion.But if you believe that’s what CBS is doing in employing Smith, you’d be wrong. Kate Smith is not a reporter at all. She is an advocate for abortion rights who exploits her perch at CBS to disguise as fact the opinions of the country’s most radical abortion-rights activists. She is Planned Parenthood’s ambassador to CBS, posing as a reporter and constructing articles that more closely resemble press releases for the nation’s most powerful abortion-rights advocacy groups. She has traded her objectivity for access to these organizations, offering them the kid-glove treatment so they will permit her to be the first to publicize their PR campaigns, interview their leaders, and scoop their briefs in court cases.Smith, a correspondent at CBS News, claims to be a reporter. She is employed not by an opinion journal but by CBS News, one of the “Big Three” broadcast television networks and a prominent mainstream journalistic outfit. You could be forgiven for believing that CBS might employ a reporter to cover abortion policy. After all, it’s a topic that requires journalistic skill and nuance. It’s one of the most hotly debated political issues in American public life, a question on which Americans have been harshly split for decades. It deserves reporting that reflects both this intense, deeply rooted polarization and the complexity and moral gravity of the subject.Then there’s Kate Smith.Here at <span class=""drop"">A</span>

No charge.What’s not in doubt is that the small margins of the restaurant business exist at the tail ends of long supply chains, a long list of expectations of what the dining-out experience should be like, the long-term social phenomenon of mass immigration, and the decay of domestic cooking ability. When this pandemic is over, many if not all of those realities are likely to be changed — and with them, perhaps, the industry itself.Commercial real-estate owners have high incentives to be generous with once-profitable tenants. There are no alternatives in this market. A substantial number of people will want to return to as much of their pre-pandemic lives as possible. Those who saw no pay cuts, furloughs, or layoffs may be itching to spend big come summertime. On the other hand, it’s likely that some social distancing will still be mandated by some states even as lockdowns loosen. And big-city restaurants can’t make rent, let alone payroll, if their dining rooms are cut in half by temporary “spacing” regulations.If immigration slows down or the nationalist mood leads to tightened borders, will the favorable prices outside the home remain? How much of America’s recent cultural change, in which “enjoying food” became a fashion statement and an end in itself, will remain when the pandemic’s over?Restaurants also depend on immigrant labor in a time when immigration is almost certainly going to slow to a trickle. One of the more arresting points in Christopher Caldwell’s new book, <span>NOW WATCH: </span>There are larger problems facing the industry too. COVID-19 won’t change everything about the way we live. But it has allowed home cooking to become suddenly fashionable on social media. Whereas before the pandemic a substantial number of customers looked to put their restaurant meals on Instagram, now they do the same for the things they cook themselves. If that trend lasts beyond the worst phase of the pandemic, it will make the restaurant industry’s recovery much more difficult.Other parts of the CARES Act increase unemployment benefits so much that re-hiring workers becomes impossible, especially for restaurants where everyone expects a dining room to be slow. Returning to work for less overall pay than UI benefits and the prospect of fewer tips makes little sense to workers, especially workers in an industry as brutal as the restaurant business. But, entrepreneurs won’t qualify for PPP relief unless they rehire all their fired staff, and rehiring everyone into an industry that won’t be able to employ that extra labor well is both unwise and impossible.One part of the “paycheck protection program” is an attempt to freeze the American economy, at least the healthy parts of it that could be thawed out later. It extends capital to businesses in the form of forgivable loans, so long as they keep or put their employees back on staff. It could have worked, but Congress’s limit on the total amount of money that would be discharged limited its effectiveness. Banks naturally gave priority to their largest customers, many of them publicly traded chains such as Potbelly or Ruth’s Chris Steak House. Now the Treasury Department is making embarrassed pleas for those companies to return the public money they received as headlines inform most smaller restaurateurs that the money available to them has already run out.All my friends and family members who work in restaurants as cooks have been “let go” from their jobs. Will they ever recover? I hope so, but the design of Congress’s CARES Act relief package has put most restaurants into a bind from which they cannot escape.We have tried once a week or so to order in from our favorite local restaurants, but they are getting hammered by the lockdown orders from the state. David Chang is a famous restaurateur, the founder of Momofuku, and the food-media successor to Anthony Bourdain. “I’m not being hyperbolic in any way,” he told the <span class=""drop"">O</span>

   These fictional scenarios assume Democratic leadership — something seldom seen in that party’s presidential debates . . . or elsewhere in the War on COVID-19.Imagine if former vice president Biden announced, “On my invitation, Dick Cheney, Al Gore, Dan Quayle, and Walter Mondale have agreed to join my Former Vice Presidents’ Committee to Crush COVID-19. We have offered the Trump administration our collective experience and individual contacts to assist this enormous national effort. I will spearhead this small, but influential, bipartisan group. We start tomorrow morning.”Viewers could have seen Senator Sanders say: “I challenged Vermont’s small businesses to help defeat COVID-19. Senator Warren could have said, “I invited the chiefs of Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Biogen, and other healthcare institutions that I represent. They joined my new Emergency Committee on COVID-19. I will stay in close touch with them and make their ideas famous as we fight this new plague.”Imagine if Senator Klobuchar had told an earlier debate: “I represent 3M, one of America’s leading safety-gear makers. The former Minnesota Manufacturing and Mining Company is headquartered in St. Paul. I spoke this afternoon with its CEO, Mike Roman. I told him, ‘Prepare for COVID-19!’ He accepted my suggestion and immediately will triple production of N95 masks, which our medical personnel and first responders soon will need — in huge numbers.”What a missed opportunity.Not until the February 25 debate in Charleston, South Carolina, did these pretenders to the presidency even say “coronavirus.”Democrats debated February 19, in Las Vegas.

No charge.Cuomo and de Blasio didn’t merely drag their feet; for far too long, they pointed the public in the wrong direction, the direction of death. Cuomo’s interest in higher office seems evident. As for De Blasio, his mayoralty ends at the end of next year, he is barred from running for a third term as New York City mayor, and not one of the city’s mayors has advanced to a higher elected office in 150 years (although a mere 107 years ago one ex-mayor did manage to win a seat in Congress). Yet his absurd presidential run is illustrative of his utter disconnection from the reality of his political strength. The magnitude of his disconnection from scientific reality is now being seen in the city’s prisons, which he is emptying, and its potter’s field, which is filling up. It would befit de Blasio’s disastrous legacy if the mass grave on Hart Island became commonly known as De Blasio’s Field.Governor Cuomo deserves comparable scrutiny for his role in playing down the crisis. On March 17, the day de Blasio first speculated that a stay-at-home order might be necessary, Cuomo said no such thing was advisable, although on March 20 he reversed course. San Francisco announced its shelter-in-place order on March 15.
Thanks to all the bad messaging, it took a week for New Yorkers to catch up to Seattle residents, who had been encouraged but not required to stay home, in adopting social distancing. “All you had to do was look at the West Coast, and you knew it was coming for us,” epidemiologist Jeffrey Sharman of Columbia University told the Disastrously, on March 4 de Blasio publicly advised New Yorkers who thought they might have the virus to go to their doctor (presumably by subway) — exactly the opposite of what the epidemiologists were saying. People were better off staying home unless they were in extremis. Not till the catastrophically late date of March 15 did the de Blasio administration allow the city’s Department of Health to post a thread advising sick people to stay home because “Everyone in NYC should act as if they have been exposed to coronavirus” and “New Yorkers who are not sick should also stay home as much as possible.” A member of the New York City Council told Duhigg that health officials “had been trying to say that publicly for weeks, but this mayor refuses to trust the experts — it’s mind-boggling.”The Mayor’s office refused to authorize testing the swabs. “They didn’t want to have to say, ‘There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of you who are positive for coronavirus, but we don’t know who,’ ” a Department of Health official told me, adding, “It was a real opportunity to communicate to New Yorkers that this is serious — you have to stay home.” The effort was blocked over fears that it might create a panic, but such alarm might have proved useful. After all, the official told me, panic is pretty effective at getting people to change their behavior. Instead, the Mayor’s office informed the Health Department that the city would sponsor a job fair to find a few new “disease detectives.” That event was held on March 12th, in Long Island City. The Department of Health official said, “We’re in the middle of a catastrophe, and their solution is to make us waste time interviewing and onboarding people!” (The Mayor’s office eventually relented on the sentinel-surveillance samples, and testing began on March 23rd — almost a month after samples were first collected. By then, the outbreak was well under way.)This was mayor-from-Yet on March 2, de Blasio urged New Yorkers in a tweet to go out on the town. On March 10, de Blasio said on MSNBC, “If you’re under 50 and you’re healthy, which is most New Yorkers, there’s very little threat here. This disease, even if you were to get it, basically acts like a common cold or flu. And transmission is not that easy.” On March 11, the day Seattle closed its schools, de Blasio said in a press conference, “If you are not sick, if you are not in the vulnerable category, you should be going about your life.” De Blasio didn’t acknowledge until April 3 that asymptomatic transmission was taking place, claiming he had learned this in the last two days. It had been 63 days since Anthony Fauci declared that asymptomatic transmission was certainly happening. Meanwhile, governor Andrew Cuomo, who often makes a point of publicly opposing de Blasio, this time joined the mayor in lethal obliviousness. “We should relax, because that is what is dictated by the reality of the situation,” Cuomo said on March 2, promising that most of the afflicted would recover easily and that “we don’t even think it’s going to be as bad as it was in other countries.”New York City’s population density is off the charts compared with the rest of the U.S., as is its usage of mass transit. A map of COVID-19’s lethality maps fairly New York is another story: 17,126 deaths in the city, 22,009 deaths in the state, and nearly all of the state’s deaths are in the metro area. That’s out of 53,755 deaths in the entire country. New York City, with less than 3 percent of the U.S. population, has more than 30 percent of the country’s fatalities.

Abbott expressed confidence that Texas “should easily exceed our goal of 25,000 tests per day” by the beginning of May.“Opening in Texas must occur in stages,” Abbott said earlier this month. “Obviously, not all businesses can open all at once on May 1.”The governor stressed that opening up the Texas economy too early would “be more likely to set us back, rather than to propel us forward.”“We must also focus on protecting the most vulnerable Texans from exposure to Covid-19. If we remain focused on protecting the lives of our fellow Texans, we can continue to open the Lone Star State,” Abbott said.Businesses that engage in close contact between people, such as hair salons and gyms, will not be allowed to reopen yet, Abbott said, adding that he wants them to open “as soon as possible” and expects that to be in mid-May.The first to reopen will be restaurants as well as retail stores, malls, theaters, libraries, and museums. Businesses will be required to keep the number of visitors at 25 percent their normal capacity for two weeks or longer. Closer to May 18, businesses will be allowed to increase capacity to 50 percent barring an increase in coronavirus cases in the state.“Now more than ever, Texans must remain committed to safe distancing practices that reduce the spread of Covid-19, and we must continue to rely on doctors and data to provide us with the safest strategies to restore Texans’ livelihoods,” Abbott said during a news conference in Austin, noting that the phased reopening plan for Texas is the “result of tremendous input.”Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Monday that he will allow the state’s economy to reopen in stages beginning Friday, when his stay-at-home order expires.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Texas to Allow Economy to Reopen in Stages Beginning This Week

No charge. <em>© 2020 by King Features Syndicate</em>Governors in some states are now loosening them up, and it’s time for other governors around the country to follow suit, except in true hot spots. In retrospect, the bans fail the cardinal rule of health care: First, do no harm.As with the lockdowns in general, it’s not clear how much of the reduced traffic in the hospitals has been the result of people changing their behavior on their own based on fear of the virus, and how much has been the result of state edicts. But it’s certainly true that the prohibitions on elective surgeries — more than 30 governors had issued some version of them as of late April — were too clumsy and sweeping, and not geographically selective enough.Elective surgeries aren’t necessarily what you think. As a piece in The examples go on and on and on. Even hospitals in New York State, a center for the virus, are feeling the pinch. Catholic Health and Kaleida Health in Buffalo are furloughing workers. So is Mohawk Valley Health System in Utica, Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, and Columbia Memorial Hospital in Hudson.West Tennessee Healthcare, based in Jackson, lost $18 million in March after the state prohibited elective surgeries, and furloughed 1,100 out of a 7,000-person staff, according to Elective surgeries are a major source of revenue for hospitals, which have taken an enormous hit as they have disappeared, often in response to state orders.But this is a case where the cure may be really worse than the disease — or at least has created its own crisis.Drastic measures were called for when the coronavirus hit our shores and began to spread out of control, especially in urban areas particularly susceptible to the pandemic. It is understandable that we wanted hospitals to prepare for the worst, and to preserve and muster equipment necessary to safely care for infected people. Hospitals themselves can become a vector for spread of COVID-19, so keeping away people who didn’t absolutely need to show up was a reasonable impulse.One reason that we didn’t want hospitals to get overrun by COVID-19 patients is that we didn’t want to crowd out everyone else needing care. But, as a deliberate choice, we’ve ended up crowding out many people needing care — even where COVID-19 surges haven’t happened and probably never will.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Not everywhere, of course. Hospitals in New York City and parts of New Jersey have been tested to their limits. But throughout much of the country, hospitals are drastically underutilized, both because states have banned elective procedures and people have been too afraid to show up.We are experiencing an epidemic that bizarrely — and in part because of the choices of policymakers — has created a surfeit of hospital beds and an excess of doctors and nurses.Many hospitals are getting pushed near, or over, the financial edge. At a time when we feared that hospitals would get overwhelmed by a surge of patients, they have instead been emptied out. At a time when we thought medical personnel would be at a premium, they are instead being idled all over the country.You could be forgiven for thinking that’s the upshot of the coronavirus lockdowns that have suspended elective surgeries and generally discouraged people from going to hospitals.<span class=""drop"">W</span>

China’s relationship with the rest of the world has never been more strained. Internal pressures in China have rarely been worse. Around the world, populations are scared, frustrated, newly unemployed, financially ruined, and angry. The revelation that a Chinese lab was the ultimate source of all this misery could set off violent repercussions for the Chinese government, the Chinese people, or Chinese Americans.However, there are a lot of economic or political elites who invested a great deal of their credibility on the idea that the Chinese government could be a trustworthy and responsible partner in prosperity, despite regular disagreements with other countries about topics such as human rights, freedom of expression, and trade-rule enforcement.If the source of the virus is a wet market or natural exposure — say, a farmer going into a cave to collect guano to use as fertilizer — then the villains of the story are familiar and aligned the status quo. No one likes poachers of exotic animals or endangered species. Experts have It is also important to understand that a great many people in powerful positions, both inside and outside of China, are consciously or subconsciously hoping the pandemic cannot be traced back to a lab accident.<a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-npr-report-virologists-faith-chinese-research-labs/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">In case you missed it on the home page yesterday,</a><strong>What We’re Debating When We’re Discussing the Labs in Wuhan</strong>The group also disparaged the idea of using The group has a couple of intriguing conclusions already, including dismissing hydroxychloroquine as a useful treatment, and their warning about antibody testing probably ought to give us laymen reason for caution.Wow.

The report was delivered to cabinet members and Vice President Mike Pence, head of the administration’s coronavirus task force.The Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs have already implemented specific recommendations, such as slashing manufacturing regulations and requirements for specific coronavirus drugs.The group has compiled a confidential 17-page report that calls for a number of unorthodox methods against the virus. One big idea is treating patients with powerful drugs previously used against Ebola, with far heftier dosages than have been tried in the past.This group, whose work hasn’t been previously reported, has acted as the go-between for pharmaceutical companies looking for a reputable link to Trump administration decision makers. They are working remotely as an ad hoc review board for the flood of research on the coronavirus, weeding out flawed studies before they reach policy makers.They call themselves Scientists to Stop Covid-19, and they include chemical biologists, an immunobiologist, a neurobiologist, a chronobiologist, an oncologist, a gastroenterologist, an epidemiologist and a nuclear scientist. Of the scientists at the center of the project, biologist Michael Rosbash, a 2017 Nobel Prize winner, said, “There’s no question that I’m the least qualified.”Next up, the “The rhesus macaque is pretty much the closest thing we have to humans,” Dr. Munster said, noting that scientists were still analyzing the result.

We’re all going to continue wearing masks, perhaps gloves, and trying to stand six feet apart. We’re going to be eating at home more or using take-out and delivery. It won’t be the same, but it will be a step.(I don’t know about you folks, but my step-counting wristband says I’m walking well more than a mile from my house most days, and I sometimes stop for a while.

Authoritarian central planning never works and it wouldn’t “save the planet.” It would just make us all less prosperous and free.For years, we have failed our young by damaging the planet and failing to protect the people most vulnerable to crises. We have a rare and short window of opportunity to rectify that — by rebuilding a better world, not reverting to one that is good for only a minority of its citizens.Toward the end of his piece, Guterres writes:In other words, in the great cause of “saving the planet,” open season would be declared against energy industries engaged in perfectly legal enterprises that have been responsible for creating the best standard of living in human history. The actual outcome of such a policy would be the obliteration of wealth, the stifling of innovation, and the loss of countless jobs.If recent history and the statements of green activists are any guide, “must pay,” is likely a passive way of saying bankrupting the oil industry, natural-gas industry, coal industry, fracking enterprises, pipeline companies, oil and gas storage facilities, oil refineries, etc. — all of which would be strip-mined of every asset they own in the way asbestos companies (actual polluters) were destroyed — with the money used to subsidize industries favored by the would-be planet savers and to pay destitute areas of the world to stifle natural-resource development. Think about the corruption potential!Think about exactly what Guterres is advocating in this mushy paragraph. By “polluters must pay for their pollution,” he isn’t referring to the cost of cleaning up oil spills or the remediation of fouled rivers, for which actual polluters are properly held responsible. Rather, he means Looking forward, public funds should invest in the future, by flowing to sustainable sectors and projects that help the environment and climate. Fossil fuel subsidies must end and How would Guterres get from here to there? The piece is mostly bereft of policy specifics — specifics breed opposition, after all — but there is one point he makes that we should focus on clearly because of its catastrophic certainty (my emphasis):A recovery from the coronavirus crisis must not take us just back to where we were last summer. It is an opportunity to build more sustainable and inclusive economies and societies — a more resilient and prosperous world.He writes:Unsurprisingly, and right on schedule, U.N. secretary general António Guterres has an op-ed in today’s Ever since the COVID-19 crisis erupted, commentators have predicted that leftists/globalists would try to hitch global warming to the ongoing fight against coronavirus — not that this required true prophetic gifts.

And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter’s field, to be a burying place for strangers.Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients, Saying: I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said: What is that to us? look thou to it. And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed: and went and hanged himself with an halter.The towering brick façades that dot the island are an unintentional monument to the various institutions that once housed its temporary inhabitants. But it is Hart Island’s permanent inhabitants that are the isle’s lasting legacy. Not long after the workhouse was built in 1868, the public burials began. In 1869, the city started ferrying inmates from the penitentiary on Blackwell’s Island to Hart Island alongside the unclaimed deceased from Bellevue Hospital. On April 20th of that year, 24-year-old Louisa Van Slyke, who had died at Charity Hospital on nearby Roosevelt Island, became the first person interred on Hart Island.

It’s a provocative one about the complicated subjects of medicine, suffering, and age. People should be able to make counterintuitive and unsettling arguments about the world without getting dragged forever. But if the people who offer anti-humanist thought experiments — the same people who were dramatically wrong about a real-life crisis — are involved in crafting real-world policy, they should, at the very least, be asked to explain their position.A number of liberal pundits But Emanuel, and other Obama-era figures such as Andy Slavitt — who <a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/03/27/ezekiel_emanuel_us_will_have_100_million_cases_of_covid-19_in_four_weeks.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">On March 27</a>The media don’t ask Emanuel about any of this. They do, however, treat him as a leading expert on COVID-19.This kind of zero-sum thinking often lurks within the environmentalist movement, and elsewhere on the Left. Yet if an AIDS patient in 2005 had adopted Emanuel-like thinking, he might have missed out on incredible technological advances that now allow people like himself to live long, fulfilling lives.Of course, Emanuel claims to be speaking only for himself, At 65, Emanuel promises to stop attempting to actively prolong his life. No more colonoscopies and no more flu shots, he assures us. “And if there were to be a flu pandemic,” he writes, “a younger person who has yet to live a complete life ought to get the vaccine or any antiviral drugs.” Does Biden’s scientific advisor believe that it is the moral responsibility of older Americans to deny themselves potential coronavirus vaccines? If not, why not?<span>NOW WATCH: </span>In his essay, Biden’s high-achieving adviser, one of the architects of Obamacare, judges the value of a life by the number of books a person can write or the number of technocratic laws they can help pass or the number of times they can climb Kilimanjaro. Did you know that the average age that Nobel Prize–winning physicists make their great discoveries is 48? Really, after that our feeble minds are “constricting of our ambitions and expectations.”While some of us believe age is catching up to Biden — time waits for no one, etc. — we still believe his life is more than political aspirations. Does Emanuel?It’s quite simple: Does Emanuel believe that Biden, aged 78 on Inauguration Day, is faltering or declining, or in a state that may not be worse than death but is nonetheless deprived? Does Emanuel consider Biden to have been robbed of his ability to contribute to work, society, and the world? Does he believe that Biden will now be remembered as feeble, ineffectual, and even pathetic? Is Biden’s creativity, originality, and productivity pretty much gone? Surely a younger person, according to Emanuel’s own societal prescription, would be better prepared for the job.I suspect that if one of Trump’s advisers on coronavirus had once taken to the august pages of That would be a peculiar position for Biden’s chief adviser on medical issues and a member of the candidate’s Public Health Advisory Committee to take. But if we accept the reasoning behind Emanuel’s infamous 2014 essay, Biden is nothing more than a resource-sucking shell of himself who should stop trying to prolong his life.<span class=""small_caps""><span class=""drop"">D</span>oes</span>

The president’s habit of making grandiose promises with little regard for how those promises will be kept is It did not help that back on March 13, The good news is that week by week, the pace of testing in the United States should increase considerably. The bad news is that despite the president’s pledge that the country would be completing five million tests per day “really soon,” that seems unrealistic considering the current capacity and even with the promised expansions.Heyward Donigan, the CEO of Rite Aid, said Monday, “we are currently operating 40 percent of the current test sites in 25 locations across eight states. We’re doing about 1,500 a day.”Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said Monday, “We’re now up to 20 sites across 11 states. By the end of next week, we’ll be to 45, and by the end of the May — end of May, we’ll be at 100.”Merlo added that beginning next month, CVS will install testing capabilities in up to 1,000 pharmacies in its stores. “We’ll be using our drive-throughs and our parking lots with swab testing. So again, you’ll see that coming online, you know, in May.” Richard Ashworth, president of Walgreens, added that his company would be expanding testing capabilities across all states, including Puerto Rico. “We’ll be able to triple the volume that we do now, in partnership with our lab partners.”Larry Merlo with CVS Health said at the White House event that since last month, “we have opened large-scale testing facilities across five states in partnership with the administration and working with the governors of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Georgia, and Michigan . . . These sites are enabling us to test approximately 1,000 individuals a day with real-time results. We now have a capacity to test about 35,000 individuals each week. And this afternoon, we announced plans to expand that capacity even further.”Once the tests are assembled and shipped, someone who knows what they’re doing has to administer the test. The responsibility of the testing process is gradually shifting from U.S. public labs and hospitals to pharmacies across the country.LabCorp CEO Adam Schechter said, “just 45 days ago, we said we could do several thousand tests a day. We can now do 60,000 tests a day, and we’re continuing to expand that capacity every single day.” He added that regarding serology testing — which is the test for antibodies in a person’s system, indicating that they have already caught and fought off SARS CoV-2 — “we can currently do about 50,000 today, and we’ll be able to do several hundred thousand per day by the middle of May.”At that same event, Steve Rusckowski, president and CEO of Quest Diagnostics said that for his company, “by the end of May, we’ll be close to 250,000 a day, about 7,000 a month. So you put those two numbers together, and it’s about 10 million tests by the end of May that we’ll be doing at Quest Diagnostics.” Marc Casper, president and CEO of Thermo Fisher Scientific, said at a Once a company has all the component parts, swabs, and reagents, it can start assembling them and sending them out the door. All of the big testing companies have dramatically increased their capacity over the past two months. But reaching that several-million-per-day threshold, even collectively, is still a steep climb.The supply chain for assembling a diagnostic test kit is complicated, and Besides the swabs, those processing the tests need reagents, chemicals that react in the presence of the virus. For what it’s worth, Michael Bevan, director of supply chain services at ARUP Labs, told Earlier this month, White House <a href=""https://www.pressherald.com/2020/04/20/maine-company-ramping-up-production-of-nasal-swabs-used-to-test-for-covid-19/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Puritan is “one of only two manufacturers</a>How quickly a company can manufacture tests depends in part upon how quickly and easily they can obtain the supplies.

So, it seems likely that any increase in gap years will disproportionately drain colleges of the students who pay the bills. How the colleges react to that could be one of the major stories of the downstream impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>What happens if the richest students bail out? The entire economic model of campuses could be undermined, especially if nobody at all is paying room and board and there is no revenue to be had from athletic programs, while colleges are still paying for their sprawling real estate and the extensive bureaucratic overhead that supports modern campus life. For some schools, this could create a spiral: Once you are no longer receiving the needed infusion of full-price tuitions, you don’t have the resources to offer as much aid. Doomsayers have predicted a higher-ed bubble-burst for a while now, and we could see it pop. Some schools on the margins may go out of business; others may finally face real pressure to trim back layers of administration and delay campus-life building projects.Colleges, especially private colleges that cost in the $60,000-70,000 a year range, rely heavily on the remaining quarter of students who can afford to pay the sticker price. The pressure to retain a baseline of these full-price students is why a number of colleges in recent years have openly adopted “need aware” rather than “need blind” admissions, pleading that their balance sheets require it. That is partly a matter of bringing in revenue, and partly a matter of subsidizing students who receive non-governmental aid.The impact of a large-scale exodus on campus life can be easily imagined, but could be temporary. Far more worrisome to campus administrators, however, is the fiscal impact. A surge in gap years may not be evenly distributed along economic lines. That could have startling consequences for the finances of colleges. According to the Department of Education’s most recent Students who want more than the bare bones are looking at their options. ABC News The gap year is suddenly a hotter topic, as colleges face the possibility that the fall semester and maybe the entire 2020-21 academic year could be done remotely, or could face serious restrictions on campus educational, extracurricular, and social activities such as sports, science labs, theater, music, clubs, and parties.

					© 2020 National Review				Our Capital Letter email newsletter delivers a weekly digest on finance, business, and economics from an NR sensibility.Sooner or later there will have to be a reckoning, which is going to force Italy’s partners in the euro zone to make some There’s much more in the CEPS report that is worth considering, but overall it underlines the extent to which Italy, a country with a massive and ever-increasing debt load and (thanks to the constraints put upon its competitiveness by the euro) little obvious way to grow out of it, is vulnerable not only to the unforgiving math of its situation, but the danger of a sudden panic.About €400 billion is held by banks. The total exposure of the Italian banking system towards all levels of the Italian government is thus €690 billion. This means that Italian banks are by far the largest source of finance for the Italian government…Bank deposits are supposedly safe. But, in reality, bank deposits are to a considerable degree indirect loans to the government….The bulk of tradable debt is…held by financial intermediaries. About €400 billion is held by banks. The total exposure of the Italian banking system towards all levels of the Italian government is thus €690 billion.Italian households own very little government debt directly. All sources agree the direct holdings amount to only about €100 billion, or 5% of total public debt. The explanation is simple: a lot of debt is held by Italian financial intermediaries (banks, insurance companies, etc.) whose ultimate beneficiaries are Italian households…..This was different in the past, when interest rates were much higher and people held large amounts of debt directly in their deposits. However, with today’s lower interest rates, few households own Buoni Ordinari del Tesoro (BOTs) or Buoni Pluriennali del Tesoro (BTPs)….One source of comfort to many investors has been the fact that so much of Italy’s debt is held domestically (and Italy is a country with a good savings rate), but as this Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte….now has to contend with the prospect of a mass investor exodus. The biggest bond-tracking indices require at least one investment-grade ranking.As a “Italy’s debt is probably heading to somewhere upwards of 170 per cent of GDP next year,” he said. “These are the kind of levels where you get junked; it doesn’t matter how much of your bonds the central bank is buying.”Mike Riddell, a bond fund manager at Allianz Global Investors, said Rome losing its investment-grade credit rating was “a matter of when, not if”.The FT’s report concludes as follows:But however low the interest rate (for now), that debt is still continuing to pile up.The Italian finance minister has commented that Fitch does not take account of the help that Italy is receiving from the EU, and specifically, the European Central Bank. That’s fair enough, the ECB’s support will be enough, at least mathematically, to keep the show on the road for now, both directly as a buyer of the country’s debt and indirectly for its effect on the interest rate that Italy has to pay on its debt. As a result, absent some sort of crisis, the country’s debt service ought to be fairly manageable.If anything, those forecasts about Italian GDP may prove to be too optimistic, and the implication of that on an already daunting debt/GDP ratio will not be pretty.In an unscheduled update on Italy’s creditworthiness, the rating agency said it expected the country’s ratio of debt to gross domestic product to rise by about 20 percentage points this year to 156 per cent, as a surge in spending combined with an 8 per cent contraction in the economy.Fitch has downgraded Italy’s credit rating to a single notch above “junk”, saying the jump in debt levels resulting from the coronavirus crisis will increase doubts about the sustainability of Rome’s borrowings.<a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/4f0cbd96-042a-43b6-919d-e8abf3cb1372"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">The</a>And, right on cue:Whichever way you look at the numbers, Italy needs at least €200 billion in stimulus money and possibly another €200 billion as a safeguard in case the markets do not step up to purchase the portion of its government debt maturing this year. Spain will need more than half those sums. The exact amounts are fuzzy, and a moving target, but they are large and neither Italy nor Spain can rustle them up without outside help.In the euro zone, the northern countries have the money to revive their economies, if just barely. The southern countries do not. Germany, like the U.S., is very likely to end up running a fiscal deficit greater than 10 percent of its GDP as a result of measures to boost its domestic economy, and will probably need additional funds to prop up its banks. Italy and Spain, undergoing much larger economic shocks, have even greater fiscal-stimulus needs, but lack the money to finance them. The Italian and Spanish governments also need to worry about  While all European countries can anticipate a terrible economic year ahead, COVID-19 has landed hardest on the weakest of them: Italy. The Italian economy has not grown since the creation of the euro zone in January 1999, and it was in one of its near-perpetual recessions when the virus began raging through Lombardy and the Veneto, the country’s most productive regions. The cracking of the Italian fault line will send financial tremors throughout Europe and the world.

No charge.Many individual human actors — from people who build and manage supply chains for great enterprises, to politicians and school administrators — will find themselves exhausted at the end of this crisis. Getting back to “normal” will begin to seem like an imperative. And normal means something like the way things were, not some great unknown future. Old habits and old dreams die hard.Political reality is a product of the beliefs, habits, dreams, and self-delusions of everyday people. Events — even great events — can temporarily interrupt those habits. But we sometimes hold on to our beliefs even tighter when they are challenged. We double down.Ask yourself: Have you met anyone whose long-term aspirations for themselves and their children have been altered by COVID-19? I haven’t. The short and medium term may be hazy, but our culture’s vision of a good and successful life is unchanged.So too with COVID-19. China and the United States were already heading for some decoupling, as evidenced by the efforts put into the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Nationalism was already having a vogue moment. Apple had already started experimenting with moving little bits of computer manufacturing back to the United States. The “eat local” movement was itself an attempt to make more durable, if less efficient, supply chains. If mass immigration continues to fall in disrepute, it was already doing so, with borders hardening all over the world.September 11 was supposed to change everything. But looking back, it just reads as addition and complexification. When I was eleven years old, my mother pulled me from school during the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Eight years later, in college, classes were canceled for two days. America’s engagement in the Middle East increased and intensified, but on the whole it remains on the same path it has been on since Jimmy Carter was president.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Having lived through September 11 and the 19 years following it, I’ve begun to believe that social and political transformation is illusory. Very few human beings experience it outside of cataclysmic world war. Things change, sure, but slowly. Humans experience social change as addition and complexification. The transformations are only obvious in hindsight.Suffering from cabin fever and worried about potential food shortages, I think that all sounds so reasonable, even inevitable. But I’m not sure it’s true. The fact that most analysts haven’t changed their fundamental analysis of the world is a clue that even they don’t expect change, so much as an intensification.An economic system that relied on worldwide production and long supply chains is morphing into one that will be less interconnected. A way of life driven by unceasing mobility is shuddering to a stop. Our lives are going to be more physically constrained and more virtual than they were. A more fragmented world is coming into being that in some ways may be more resilient.The very perceptive essayist John Gray intones: “The era of peak globalisation is over.” This fits with his ongoing argument that liberal elites have indulged in decades of self-deception about the justice and sustainability of their way of life. He writes:And yet, there is a funny way in which the change that analysts, pundits, and experts prophesy is the change they already wanted. China hawks say coronavirus will require hard decoupling. Trade hawks say it will require onshoring. Environmentalists want us to develop a taste for their cleaner air that comes with less human productivity. Skeptics of the growth of the American university system predict its imminent collapse. Social traditionalists predict a newer wave of stay-at-home mothers and the growth of homeschooling. People who habitually fret about declining adherence to religion predict that more people will lose the habit of religion. Nationalists predict more nationalism. Each of these predictions is framed in a way to alternately elicit hope or fear for the future.It must, right? Some relationships are unsustainable. A substantial number of people are being forced to do without normalcy and to adapt. Business travel replaced by Zoom. Commuting replaced teleconferencing. School displaced by distance learning and iPads. Restaurants replaced with takeout and home-cooking. Travel replaced with . . . nothing at all. And, economically speaking, the world is going through simultaneous supply and demand shocks.<span class=""drop"">W</span>

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.After the far-left press has gotten its revenge, persecuting Morrissey as a “far-right” traitor to pop liberalism (they prefer the anti-monarchist stance of his early records with The Smiths), this album should win its proper historical position.   
   This album is based in earned wisdom, and every track — creatively exploring dance pop, baroque art pop, and folk confession — confirms the process of tough, unconventional thinking and self-examination. Morrissey understands the snotty, cowardly nature of media braggarts as well as those who envy the commanding heights. In “The Secret of Music,” a trance-like exploration matches emotional uncertainty to artistic means. At precisely the moment that conventional pop media has betrayed the public, scaring it to death, Morrissey refines his purpose. Or, as the audacious rapper DJ Kool once said, “Let me clear my throat.” Morrissey’s most heartrending, scratchy vocal comes next on “My Hurling Days Are Done.”The album splits between individuated tracks on the first half and a second half that moves between several intense personal confessions (such as the exquisite “Darling, I Hug a Pillow”) that deserve more detailed examination than can be done here. (In short, one masterpiece after another.) But a most representative track is “The Truth About Ruth” which has been misunderstood as a song about transsexual rights when it is nothing so inane. (Just as 2018’s “Israel” was a distinctly personal, romantic pledge, not mere nationalism.) Here is where Morrissey exposes figments of the political imagination — the fallacies that keep us apart. The lyric “You know who you are, but you have no idea” exposes the political certainty that anyone (male, female, black, white, religious, atheist) can casually buy into.Following the reevaluated folk songs of last year’s The second-most compassionate track, “Once I Saw the River Clean,” is a remembrance of Morrissey’s childhood and his family history that also recognizes his fate, and ours: “Distant future wait for me. . . . Time will come but it hasn’t yet / Someone’s out to get me.” Overall, the album encapsulates the fine points of mortal consciousness — every song offering specific instances of memory and contemplation, the most profound human faculties.Compassion is Morrissey’s greatest gift, and it shows on the album’s two major tracks. The first, “Bobby, Don’t You Think They Know,” addresses the ongoing drug epidemic as a false response to modern terror and anxiety. Duetting with R & B veteran Thelma Houston, Morrissey powerfully expresses the inner strength of morally based empathy, underscored by Houston’s soulful wailing — a different register from the white indie pop he’s known for but that confirms a universal awareness. “You ain’t foolin’ nobody!” Houston exhorts, talking tough about the delusions of a loved one in pain. This disturbing and magnificent track ranks with Merry Clayton’s vocals on “Gimme Shelter,” Dusty Springfield on “What Have I Done to Deserve This?” and Tammy Wynette on “Justified and Ancient.” It’s a wake-up call to licentious pop that encourages reckless self-justification.
As pop stars grow into maturity (Morrissey will be 61 next month), few maintain ingenuity while risking popularity. This album’s varied and inventive production continue the innovations of 2018’s Morrissey, as defiant as Kanye West, examines the self-protective impulses that characterize human weakness (“Jim Jim Falls” compares moral indecision to artistic suicide). Then he elucidates the faith and courage required in times of deep, existential — even metaphysical — stress (“Love Is on Its Way Out”).Although Morrissey’s skepticism of media maintains the bravery that once made British pop exciting, and Morrissey achieves greatness when the new release opens up punk’s political rebellion to reveal personal urgency in new melodious styles — thinking for himself, singing to all, speaking to you.<span class=""drop"">N</span>

No charge.Unhappily, there is no treatment for what ails Bill de Blasio, and no cure in sight for New York.His incompetence has endangered the lives of his constituents and made the coronavirus situation worse than it had to be. But it is his tinpot-tyrant posturing and his ridiculous preening that really set him apart from your run-of-the-mill municipal bungler.The coronavirus epidemic was a test for Mayor de Blasio, and he has been found wanting — which should be no surprise to anybody who has witnessed the dramatic decline in the quality of city life under his watch. The tricky question of balancing the consequences of an enforced economic stoppage against the risks of an unknown and poorly understood viral epidemic in a free society with democratic norms has gotten the better of better men and better mayors than Bill de Blasio.De Blasio has instructed police to follow a “zero tolerance” rule on gatherings and has threatened to enforce his policy with arrests. Perhaps he has not entirely thought through the social-distancing implications of mass arrests.De Blasio launched a broadside against “the Jewish community” after a large crowd turned out for a rabbi’s funeral in Williamsburg as though the event corporately implicated the more than 1 million Jews living in New York City, drawing criticism from the city’s ADL and other local Jewish leaders.De Blasio moved with much less dispatch than did colleagues in California and Ohio, among other places. And then, after dawdling for so long, de Blasio flipped. We always are happy to see a politician amend his views to accommodate new facts, but Slowpoke de Blasio’s subsequent overcompensation, and the sanctimony and viciousness he brings to the effort, is something else.De Blasio did manage to name his wife as head of a coronavirus-recovery panel. He always has time for that sort of thing. Mrs. de Blasio is fresh off of watching $1 billion walk out the door while overseeing a fruitless mental-health initiative. She has time on her hands and is rumored to be considering a run for elected office herself.Ignoring the advice and recommendations of the relevant experts in order to tend to his political concerns, Mayor de Blasio effectively became a member of that class of villain most hated by his progressive allies: a De Blasio was warned in early March that the city needed to take more aggressive action against the epidemic, but he wrote off advice from health commissioner Oxiris Barbot and others, worried that a lockdown would hurt the city’s economy. Extended deliberations controlled by political concerns rather than medical ones wasted precious time. “He has long distrusted the top brass of the health department,” In all likelihood, the coronavirus has been spreading in New York since February. The city’s jam-packed subway system, carrying five million riders a day, should have counseled particular vigilance. But even with the examples of California’s and Washington’s cities before him, the mayor was slow to move. He dragged his staff along to a crowded YMCA for a workout even as he was ordering gyms closed around the city. The city schools remained open until March 15, and it was left to New York governor Andrew Cuomo to negotiate their closure while teachers were threatening a wildcat strike. De Blasio delayed against the advice of his own aides and health experts. A 36-year-old principal subsequently died of COVID-19. The city’s refusal to disclose infections in the schools “kept families in the dark and left more lives at risk,” as one city councilman put it.We sympathize with those New Yorkers driven to drink or inspired to prayer by Mayor de Blasio’s incompetence, vanity, and stupidity, which have been highlighted by but are by no means limited to his response to COVID-19. For the time being, they must suffer in their households rather than in congregation.<span class=""small_caps""><span class=""drop"">I</span>n</span>

Voluntary exchange needs to be respected. This is no time to cut off companies from the oxygen of capital markets. This bill is a statist nightmare hiding behind the mask of good intentions.At the core of all this is the age-old “knowledge problem.” Warren and AOC’s fatal conceit is to believe that they know more about what a given small business needs or does not need than the owners and management of that business. A time of crisis only makes the stakes higher. Disconnected politicians who have no knowledge of specific company issues, sector challenges, and the countless nuances that exist within an industry can do irreparable harm by insisting that the government should get in the way.An infusion of equity would be the preferred option for many companies in distress. But what about companies 
The unintended consequences of this bill would either be (a) more business failures, meaning more debt defaults, unemployment, and contagion effects throughout that company’s vendor network, or (b) the additional leveraging of companies that are already in distress with an almost inevitably negative effect on their future growth, and with that their ability to increase wages and hire more workers.What happens if an opportunistic buyer is legally banned from taking an equity position in a distressed company? It is worth remembering that acquisitions cannot be closed without The bill would bar acquisitions by certain categories of purchaser (private equity firms, hedge funds, or any company with $100 million of revenues or else $100 million in market capitalization) until the FTC determined that “small businesses, workers, and consumers are no longer under severe financial distress.”What is fascinating is the sleight of hand the two lawmakers are using — calling their bill the “Pandemic Anti-Monopoly Act,” but then defending it on the basis of an anti-predatory rationale. Antitrust laws were not repealed when the coronavirus pandemic struck, so if there is a proposed merger that could violate them, regulatory agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department already have the jurisdiction to step in. This would, of course, cover the formation of an unlawful monopoly, but Warren and AOC’s broader concerns about “predatory” behavior are worth a closer look in their own right.<span class=""drop"">S</span>

No charge.For the first time since the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre 30 years ago, the world has awakened to these ugly realities, and if anything good has emerged from this chaotic geopolitical era, that might be it. Here’s hoping that more aggressive action to counter Beijing comes next.In short, the world finally seems to be recovering from its decades-long love affair with the PRC, which peaked with the rise of Xi, who was initially viewed as a reformer who would bring China onto the world’s stage as an equal, responsible actor. The true nature of the regime is becoming more apparent, and the world doesn’t like what it sees: the dreadful treatment of ethnic minorities and the rural poor; the obvious interference in Taiwan’s recent presidential election; the belligerence toward Hong Kong as the “one country, two systems” agreement is systematically dismantled and pro-democracy leaders are arrested or just disappear; the bullying of emerging economies through debt diplomacy; and now what is very likely a global pandemic caused by Chinese negligence.This backlash is appearing even in European countries that once saw China as a potential counterbalance to the Trump administration. In Sweden, for instance, some cities have ended sister-city relationships with Chinese counterparts, and the country has closed its Confucius Institute schools, dealing a blow to one of Beijing’s other soft-power propaganda operations. European leaders, including NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenburg and French president Emmanuel Macron, have also called for better understanding of how Beijing handled the coronavirus pandemic and pushed back against China’s campaign to deflect blame for it.Xi-era chauvinism is beginning to create a backlash around the world. One example is the cooling ardor toward the Belt and Road Initiative, Xi’s aforementioned effort to gain footholds in foreign markets. Many projects have caused host countries to take on excessive debt. In one instance, a strategic port in Sri Lanka was ceded to China when the debt burden became too high. Politicians in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and other countries have reversed earlier positions of support because of what they see as China’s discriminatory debt diplomacy.  In some ways, the gulf between the rich in China’s cities and the poor in its rural areas has been institutionalized through the longstanding “hukou” system of internal registration, which hampers movement between regions and creates what amounts to an economic caste system. While Xi has made hukou reform a priority in order to create greater opportunity for urban migration and prosperity, the system continues to reinforce the divide between urban haves and rural have-nots. As the former become wealthier and more global in their perspective, the disdain they frequently show for those who are different — whether from Africa or rural China — is becoming more pronounced.Han Chinese make up the same percentage of the population in Hong Kong as on the mainland, and are 97 percent of the population in Taiwan. Neither Hong Kongers nor Taiwanese have suffered any less at Xi’s hands for that. Nor, for that matter, have the 400 million mostly Han Chinese living on less than $5 a day in the country outside China’s megacities, who face vicious discrimination from urban elites.That said, there is a quality to the pattern of behavior in the PRC that transcends ethnicity. Chinese racial discrimination is horrifying in its own right, of course. But it also suggests a farther-reaching chauvinism that is emerging as the defining characteristic of the Xi era.Beijing’s response to critics who note all of this is to try to drown them out by highlighting America’s own well-documented history of racial discrimination. But that’s the point: Our historical sins are well-documented, and they inform just about every aspect of our public policy. A free press and other institutions hold up our actions for the world to see. There is no mystery about how our country continues to deal with the effects of the institutionalized discrimination that persisted for nearly two centuries after our own founding, and for a century after we fought a war to end it.It would be natural to presume that such discrimination is a regrettable result of the dominance of the Han Chinese, who are more than 90 percent of China’s population and dominate its society. (By comparison, ethnic Uighurs, for example, make up less than 1 percent of the population.)  The Han Chinese, with 1.3 billion members, are the largest ethnic group not just in the PRC but in the world. Antipathy, oppression, and discrimination toward minority ethnic groups in a country with such a dominant majority is regrettable but not surprising, and not unique to the PRC.In fact, China’s ill-treatment of foreign-minority populations reflects how the Chinese government treats its own citizens. Muslim minority Uighurs are being held in so-called re-education camps intended to strip them of their religious and ethnic identity, and in many cases subjected to forced labor. In Tibet, which China has oppressed since the very beginning of Communist rule in 1949, things have gotten worse under Xi: Last year, Freedom House named Tibet the second-least-free territory on Earth, behind only war-torn Syria.
Much of this is taking place in Guangzhou, known to some as “Little Africa” because it has the largest African-immigrant population in China. To some extent, African immigration to China is a by-product of Xi Jinping’s effort to build a global network of trade and infrastructure investment that gives the regime a perceived geopolitical advantage over the West in the developing world. Ghanaians, Nigerians, and other immigrants to China are all too happy to take advantage of the work and educational opportunities China offers. But many of them have learned the hard way just how limited the country’s kindness is.There is ample evidence of this. A recent Reuters report noted that ambassadors from several African nations recently engaged the Chinese foreign ministry to raise concerns about how their citizens are being mistreated in China. Passport holders from African countries are subject to extreme stop-and-search practices. Many who are coronavirus-negative are being forced into 30-day quarantines anyway. Foreigners from a range of countries who can document clean bills of health are being denied entry to places of business and other facilities simply because they are foreigners.As NR’s Jim Geraghty has noted, the incident is an example of the “xenophobia and racism” on display just now in China. This phenomenon is not new to the PRC, but the government has an extra incentive to lean into it now, because it helps the government’s concerted campaign to deflect blame for the global coronavirus pandemic.That sounds like what it almost certainly is: a product of the company’s communications department, called in to do damage control. And while we can accept that the McDonald’s corporation itself is not, on the whole, racist, the sign <span class=""drop"">E</span>

No charge.The absence of a much-feared wave of election-induced infections in Wisconsin is one small piece of good news in an otherwise grim month. Voters attempted to keep their distance from one another and mostly waited outside the polling places — perhaps another data point indicating that the virus does not spread well outdoors.A record 1.1 million Wisconsin voters cast ballots by mail (or voted early in person), and that allowed polling places to be sparsely populated in most of the state on Election Day. But thousands of voters in Milwaukee and Green Bay experienced long lines and waits of up to two hours — the type of mass gathering that many feared would spread the virus.The official running Milwaukee’s elections said he didn’t know how many National Guardsmen would be available at the time he decided to only open five polling centers. “Had we had that information [about the National Guard] sooner, I absolutely think it could have influenced the number of voting centers,” Neil Albrecht, the executive director of the city’s election commission, said on April 7.The mayor of Green Bay rejected dozens of volunteers who offered to work the polls, and the city of Milwaukee used more than 80 poll workers and 30 National Guardsman at each of its five polling locations. Milwaukee employs an average of eleven poll workers at each polling place during a typical presidential primary.Such a drastic reduction in the number of polling places did not occur in most of the state, and city officials in Milwaukee and Green Bay have One major factor that spurred Evers’s last-minute attempts to postpone the election were reports that the number of polling places would be greatly reduced in the cities of Milwaukee and Green Bay. While Green Bay usually has 31 polling places, it had only two open on April 7. Milwaukee’s typical 180 polling places were consolidated into five locations.To back up Evers, the state’s health-department secretary-designee, Andrea Palm, expressed absolute certitude that in-person voting would result in more COVID-19 deaths, saying, on April 6: “In-person voting would, without question, accelerate the transmission of COVID-19 and increase the number of cases.

He called on the state legislature to change the law so that an all-mail election could be held in May. The legislature rebuffed Evers’s request, and on April 6, the day before the election, Evers attempted to unilaterally postpone the election — an order he had repeatedly said would be illegal.For several weeks after the outbreak of the coronavirus in the United States, Democratic governor Tony Evers continued to support holding the election on April 7, and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee The weekend before the election, a major fight erupted between the state’s Democratic governor and Republican legislature over postponing the vote.A Democratic state senator suggested last week that there had been a surge of cases because of the election, but as

It may be a very different individual; someone who has been changed by his experiences. Twenty years will have passed — more or less exactly the time between the last movie and today . . . It will be, I promise, I guarantee, something very, very different.”The problem was that this series wanted to have its cake and eat it, too. It wanted to give Picard his noble, self-sacrificing death, Picard clearly aimed to tackle big questions such as “what does it mean to be alive” and “who defines what is really alive?” (If you squint, the villains’ insistence that synthetic beings — basically vat-grown, flesh-and-blood robots — could not possibly count as ‘alive’ looks a little like a pro-life critique of abortion.) But the first season wrapped up those questions a little too neatly and quickly in that final episode. Our protagonists witness the brief appearance of a near-omnipotent ancient malevolent race of sentient artificial life capable of wiping out “trillions” of lives . . . and once the immediate threat ends, they shrug and move on.Some will see the moral and institutional decline of Starfleet depicted in It might have worked better to have the crew recruit Picard rather than the other way around. Our gang of misfits finds out about some terrible plot that’s way beyond their ability to stop, Starfleet thinks it’s a bunch of nonsense, leaving them no choice but to turn to the retired, semi-disgraced Picard.The sudden and then considerable presence of Jeri Ryan’s old Once assembled, Picard’s new gang is generally fine; perhaps the most fun concept is that Captain Rios’s private-ship maintenance crew is a multitude of holograms that all look like him but speak with different accents. (The engineer hologram speaking with a Scottish accent was a great shout-out to the original series’ Scotty. I’d like to think that Starfleet honored Montgomery Scott by requiring all engineers to speak with that accent.)The creators clearly wanted to create a Patrick Stewart is as good as he ever was, meaning Picard the character is as good as ever. With April nearly complete, let’s turn to something lighter: Over the last two months, this newsletter has covered some dark and depressing topics: <strong>Finally, Something Much Lighter: Assessing <em>Star Trek: Picard</em></strong>Ask yourself: Is it really Florida and Georgia that are beset by the worst leadership in this crisis? Are there a certain number of people who would prefer to discuss the controversial decisions of Republican governors, because the failures and bad decisions of the most prominent Democratic mayor in the country are so glaringly consequential?“There’s always a bit of a split between the political appointees, whose jobs are to make a mayor look good, and public-health professionals, who sometimes have to make unpopular recommendations,” a former head of the Department of Health told me. “But, with the de Blasio people, that antagonism is ten times worse.

In other parts of the U.S., 911 calls for medical assistance have dropped. In Seattle, an early epicenter of the pandemic, data shows that EMT and paramedic calls dropped by more than 25% in the first 10 days of April compared with the same time frame last year. It’s unclear how much, if any, of that drop is due to people being fearful of interacting with the health care system.”Experts say it’s possible that some of the jump in at-home death stems from people infected by the virus who either didn’t seek treatment or did but were instructed to shelter in place, and that the undercount is exacerbated by lack of comprehensive testing. It’s also possible that the increase in at-home deaths reflects people dying from other ailments like heart attacks because they couldn’t get to a hospital or refused to go, fearful they’d contract COVID-19.That spiking death rate in major cities reflects the spread of SARS-CoV-2 — Cancer patients needed to postpone most non-life-and-death treatments for about seven weeks: ““I don’t think that Harris is accurately defining moral relativism, but even beside that point, he glides over the fact that people will die if we are to continue the lockdown, too.Like [Colorado governor Jared] Polis, I am willing to accept that some people must die in order to accommodate the return to whatever the post-pandemic version of normal is.

Between $50 billion and $300 billion over two years. But compared to what? The current lockdown regime is the costliest emergency of our lifetimes. The price we are paying now, including eye-popping outlays of up to $350 billion If a vaccine comes along, so much the better. But this roadmap would permit us to cope with a world that contains COVID-19 — or some future pathogen — without letting it wreak devastation on the economy or our health.Phase Two would permit the reopening of many businesses while maintaining social distancing for vulnerable populations. Phase Three would see about 80 percent of the economy back on track, and Phase Four would see a new normal in which the economy returned to pre-pandemic levels but with testing, careful monitoring, and improved decontamination to suppress further outbreaks.Phase One would focus on essential workers, the 40 percent of the workforce who are not able to self-quarantine and alarming numbers of whom are falling ill. Doctors and nurses are at high risk. Seventeen percent of the New York City police force is infected, and the outbreak at meat-processing plants has prompted the chairman of Tyson Foods to warn that the “food supply chain is breaking.”Once infected people are identified, they need to be supported in isolation — meaning that they should be able to expect sick pay, the guarantee of a job when they return, and perhaps temporary housing (hotels may be useful for those who need it). Their contacts also must be informed and urged to self-isolate for the two-week incubation period. Johns Hopkins University has estimated that we will need to hire and train at least 100,000 new personnel. This will involve the use of apps and other technologies that pose privacy concerns, but experience with other epidemics such as HIV has shown that it can be done sensitively. After a negative test, people can safely return to work.
We are currently testing about 150,000 people a day. That number needs to ramp up fast to 2 million a day and then quickly to 5 million per day, reaching 20 million by August. To accomplish this, Safra calls for a Pandemic Testing Board modeled on World War II’s War Production Board to coordinate the innovation, supply chains, and regulatory changes necessary to facilitate this. Testing is always a critical part of disease control but never more than in this case, when so many carriers are asymptomatic.Fortunately, the Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard has gathered experts from across the political spectrum and prepared a very compelling roadmap for escaping from this trap. It requires shifting focus from quarantining the entire population (with its attendant economic pain) to testing on a massive scale, contact tracing, and supported isolation (TTSI). With the proper level of TTSI, we could begin safely to reopen the economy, sector by sector, starting with the most essential.On the other hand, it’s simply untenable to keep huge sectors of the economy in what Will Wilkinson of the Niskanen Center calls “soft house arrest” indefinitely or to open up only to be forced to shut down again in the face of new illness spikes. We are stuck in limbo. We’ve succeeded in flattening the curve but haven’t conceived a way to avoid thousands more deaths without causing an economic catastrophe.Neither reckons with the indispensable bridge — the testing problem. Whatever mayors, governors, or presidents might say, we cannot restart the economy as long as people are too frightened to resume working, shopping, and socializing. An NPR/Marist poll found that 65 percent of Americans believe that it would be a “bad idea” to have people return to work until further testing is available, and 80 percent say the same about eating in restaurants. Even larger majorities oppose opening schools or sporting events.<span class=""drop"">O</span>

But it’s already obvious that the process of its formulation will be more contentious and uncertain than Congress’s pandemic-response efforts have been so far. This is not the end of the world: Contention is Congress’s bread and butter. But it’s vital that members focus on the scope and character of the calamity the country is confronting and look for ways to address the actual problems we face, rather than just revert to longstanding partisan reflexes. Our politics will return to normal in time, and those reflexes will again have their proper place. But that time has not yet come, and pretending it has will only extend the crisis.But all of these divisions, and the great bulk of the ongoing discussions about Phase IV, are about the economic response to the crisis. What about the public-health response? This is the fourth area of uncertainty I’d point to as the bill takes shape. Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress are paying too little attention to the continuing need for federal coordination, action, and funding for testing, tracing, and treatment of COVID-19. We may be passing the peak of this first phase of the pandemic, but to start gradually re-opening the economy and to be prepared for a second phase of outbreak in the fall, we will need to be mobilizing America’s public-health infrastructure and medical-research enterprise. Somehow, there is still not enough urgency on this front in Washington. Support for massively expanded testing and for But ultimately, this crisis is going to require both some form of federal bailout in response to pandemic-related state spending and some sort of reckoning for states whose longstanding recklessness is now becoming untenable. Changes to bankruptcy laws to give states more options (as McConnell implied) should be This is the third area of contention I’d point to: the coming crisis of American federalism. The pandemic and the ensuing economic disaster are placing enormous pressures on state finances, and there is no question that Congress will be called on to help. Some such help is in order, yet some states (Important though both these issues are, however, they are relatively marginal. Core questions of economic assistance, let alone of public health, remain to be addressed, and at this point Republicans do not seem unified around specific ways of doing that. They are also divided when it comes to helping the states, which will be an enormous challenge as Phase IV goes forward.The liability question, which Democrats are dug in on this question—it is their version of regressing to reflex. Some seem almost to see this as a means of enacting more generous minimum wages, failing to grasp the enormous economic harm this approach is likely to cause. So while Republicans are intent on addressing the problem, their ability to do that in this next bill will be limited. They may be able to reduce the extra benefit (from $600 a week) as a condition of pushing back its expiration date. But that remains unclear.On the unemployment question, Republicans seem utterly unified. They are hearing a lot about it from constituents—particularly employers who want to retain their workers through the crisis but are finding that those workers prefer to be laid off onto the unemployment rolls, where at least temporarily they can make more money. This makes it difficult for employers to make use of PPP loans (which are only forgiven if employers maintain payrolls), and will make it difficult for shuttered businesses to re-open when they are allowed to. But above all, it is worsening and will extend the economic downturn we have entered.So what do Senate Republicans agree on? In my conversations, there has been an emphasis on two issues above all: Fixing the perverse incentives in the CARES Act’s increase in unemployment benefits, and providing employers with liability protections as they re-open businesses.But the crisis is not behind us. The worst of it, especially in economic terms, is surely ahead of us. And it’s going to take more than fine-tuning to help Americans through it and to keep it from doing more lasting damage to our economy than it has to. My view, like that of John Thune, the Senate Majority Whip, expressed this view a few days ago to the But just what demands would Republicans make? This is the second source of contention and uncertainty at this point. There has been a peculiar loss of focus by both parties in Congress on the particular challenges the country is facing in this crisis. Both are reverting to their familiar reflexes some. For the Democrats, those reflexes are fundamentally programmatic, and so Republicans are finding that their Democratic colleagues increasingly talk about the response to this crisis in terms of bulking up existing welfare programs and checking off longstanding agenda items with little connection to the pandemic. President Trump has been falling back on careless reflex too, with his ridiculous emphasis on “infrastructure” in the Phase IV bill. For Senate Republicans, the reversion to reflexes points toward the restraint of federal action and spending, so that some members are implicitly beginning to put this crisis in the past tense far too early.So McConnell’s preference is to have the next bill start in the House. At this point, that looks likely to happen, even though House leaders have announced they Some Republican Senators were happy with that, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell clearly wasn’t. He thinks holding the pen put Senate Republicans at a disadvantage, since it gave both House and Senate Democrats enormous leverage to make specific demands. McConnell was also immensely irritated by the administration’s behavior in that process—especially the president’s tendency to change his mind on key issues under the slightest pressure while Senate Republicans were trying to negotiate, and Mnuchin’s willingness to deal directly with Nancy Pelosi and undercut Republicans when the president changed his views.I’d point to four emerging areas of division or uncertainty in the legislation. The first has to do with just who will have the pen and draft the bill. The CARES Act, that $2 trillion measure enacted in late March, began in the Senate and so was mostly drafted by Senate Republicans. Those Republicans were of course under pressure to satisfy both House and Senate Democrats to get the bill passed, and they were also constantly frustrated by the tendency of administration officials (especially Treasury Secretary Mnuchin) to negotiate directly with House Democrats. But they gave the bill its basic character.But the next phase of relief and response legislation, the so-called “Phase IV” bill, does not look likely to go nearly as smoothly. Not only familiar partisan debates but also some divisions among Senate Republicans have been emerging as members turn their attention to that next stage. Ironically, these familiar dividing lines may be the first sign of a return to normality as the shock of the crisis wears off just a little. But they also suggest that Congress is dangerously disconnected from some of the most important realities of both the public-health and economic facets of the national calamity we’re living through.In March, in response to the public-health emergency of COVID-19, Congress passed three large pieces of legislation in short order and with relatively little friction. Even the third and by far the largest of these bills, a $2 trillion economic relief measure that did involve some bargaining and partisan confrontations, was drafted quickly and pretty much passed unanimously. In late April, another bill adding funding to the small-business relief program created in March, again basically sailed through both houses.National ReviewFollow Us",0,The Coming Clashes over Phase IV Legislation

To estimate a more complete ratio of deaths to hospitalizations, we also included data on the probability that a person with a respiratory infection would die outside of a hospital admission. For this we used publically available mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics for the U.S. population in 2010 to identify the deaths attributable to pneumonia and influenza (ICD-10 codes: J10-J18) and the proportion that occurred while hospitalized vs. outside of a hospital admission (e.g., at home, on arrival, in the emergency department, in hospice or long-term care facility).That “ratio of deaths to hospitalizations,” in turn, comes from massaging still other numbers:First, we adjusted the reported annual hospitalization rates from FluSurv-NET [a system that collects flu data from a small subset of U.S. health-care providers] . . . using multipliers that included the probability of being tested for influenza and the sensitivity of influenza testing. . . .

No charge.Brendan McDermid/ReutersA scientist holds a sample during coronavirus testing at New York City's health department during the coronavirus outbreak in New York City, April 23, 2020.   Advertisement<em>© 2020 by King Features Syndicate</em>We as a free people will have to decide the important questions raised by this crisis, not the doctors on TV or the researchers in the labs.Obviously, science already has made an enormous contribution to our fight against the coronavirus, and may — through therapies or a vaccine — go a long way to solving this crisis. But life is not an equation, and neither is politics or policy.The people in our political debate who most volubly insist that they are simply following “the science” tend also to be most resistant to nuance and prone to unscientific fervency. They are using “science” as a bludgeon and conversation stopper.Then, there are the big questions. Science can’t tell us how we should think about the trade-off between the economic misery caused by shutdowns and the public health risks of reopenings. It can’t determine the balance between shutting down a hospital’s elective surgeries so it can prepare for a COVID-19 surge, and tanking its business.We worried about running out of ventilators, but in recent weeks some doctors have been wondering whether they have been overused.If we are going to unquestioningly accept expert opinion, we’d better prepare for whiplash. At first, the elite consensus was that wearing masks was unnecessary. Now, we are told it’s an essential piece of getting out of this mess.The models of how the virus would spread were invested with a certainty that they didn’t deserve.Science can indeed settle debates once and for all — we don’t argue about heliocentrism any more. But an extraordinary feature of the coronavirus is how poorly understood it is. We don’t know how many people have it, what the death rate is, or how best to treat it, among other things.Invoking scientists in this crisis is a little like saying, “My economic policy is going to be guided by an ECONOMIST.” Well, good for you. But is your economist on the left or on the right? Does he care most about inequality or dynamism? Is he Paul Krugman or Art Laffer?Science can make the atom bomb; it doesn’t tell us whether we should drop it. Science can tell us how to get to the moon; it doesn’t tell us whether we should go. Science can build nuclear reactors; it doesn’t tell us whether we should deploy them.Science has a limited competency, though. Once you are outside a lab setting and dealing with matters of public policy, questions of values and how to strike a balance between competing priorities come into play, and they simply can’t be settled by people in white lab coats.The world was slow to react to the coronavirus, and yet the genetic code of the virus was publicly posted by China on January 20, and South Korea had deployed a test kit by early February. It’s <span>NOW WATCH: </span>Modern science is obviously one of the wonders of our age. We owe it an unimaginable debt — for technological advancements in medicine, transportation, industry, communication, computing, and more. All honor to Newton, Turing, Curie, and Einstein.The invocation of science as the ultimate authority capable of settling questions of how we should govern ourselves is a persistent feature of modern Western life going back several centuries and has always been a mistake. It is especially so in this crisis, when so much is still unknown about the coronavirus and immensely complicated and consequential public-policy questions are in play.Neil DeGrasse Tyson calls the crisis “a giant experiment in whether the world will listen to scientists, now and going forward.”Joe Biden has urged President Trump, “Follow the science, listen to the experts, do what they tell you.”Governor Gavin Newsom tweeted the other day, “The West Coast is — and will continue to be — guided by SCIENCE.”<span class=""drop"">I</span>

He indicated its urgency with a teasing innuendo, borrowed from France’s greatest romantic-comedy filmmaker: “As Sacha Guitry said, ‘It [the virus] is against us. But right up against us.’”Baier asks, “Do you work toward precision?” Godard answers, “No, I work toward doubt or passion. Joseph Conrad said doubt is our passion, passion is our duty.” That passion is almost palpable when Godard muses on how today’s film students mostly watch clips of classic movies, extracts rather than the full work of art. With rigorous honesty, Godard relates this Millennial reality to his own collage-based methods — but then the aesthete comes through in a detailed recall of Agnes Moorehead’s performance in one scene of Orson Welles’s There’s mutual respect if not exactly camaraderie for Baier, who directed the remarkable, semi-documentary coming-of-age film <iframe allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen"" frameborder=""0"" height=""630"" src=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wEjNy_y-8Ys"" width=""1120""></iframe>Cinema’s surviving sage, 89-year-old Godard, smiles frequently for Baier, like a slightly distracted elder who hangs in to give you some wisdom. His wispy gray hair arches over his bald spot like an accent The virus brings Godard back to this fundamental process. Just as he revolutionized movies with his 1960 debut feature This is also the basic archetype of film culture, even when we can no longer “go to the movies” but movies (content) now seem to come at us.As celebrities assemble before their quarantined webcams to fatuously repeat, “We’re all in this together,” Godard goes to the crux: “They’re not giving us any actual information. I’m surprised that they don’t give out more information.” He dares scientists to study RNA along with DNA to chart the development of the virus. As always with Godard, he calls us to challenge the source of information and the path of its distribution, which are crucial to the way that we receive knowledge and sort it out, and to how we develop our morality and our politics.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Not playing a doctor, Godard hits on an important aspect of the COVID-19 crisis that pertains to language and propaganda — his long-time preoccupations. “Science too is bogged down in words and numbers. Otherwise there wouldn’t be a catastrophe like this,” he says, confessing, “I don’t know.” His summation: “I am happy to have found filmmaking. It’s sort of an antibody so to speak.”This proposal is as intriguing as the disquisitions in Godard’s poetic lecture-collage films Godard resides in the Swiss town of Rolle, where Baier made his pilgrimage to Godard’s sunlit workspace. Baier and his small camera crew wear facial masks, while Godard puffs on a cigar, speaking past the maduro, maintaining social distance but directly addressing the coronavirus catastrophe in typically theoretical terms: “The virus is a form of communication that needs something to survive on. It needs to latch on to a host, like certain birds.”Who better than Godard to explain this attack on our biology and spirituality as a cultural-political crisis? He gets immediately to the point while also updating his own career history.Godard talks us through film culture’s now-paralyzed state: Owing to social-distancing shutdowns and distributors’ frozen release schedules (not just in the U.S. but across the globe), cinema is no longer a communal art. The unavoidable capitulation to television and digital streaming means we’re drifting further away from movie aesthetics and film history. The all-important spatial dimensions of bringing the world — especially the human face — intimately close are being lost, and so is the idea of larger-than-life discovery.<span class=""drop"">I</span>

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH:</span><strong>ADDENDUM</strong>It turns out that the claims of a great achievement of an endeavor involving the New England Patriots plane were China sent defective masks and received $2 million and received a gushing press conference with profuse expressions of gratitude in return. God knows how many cops, first responders, and other personnel have been walking around the state of Massachusetts thinking they were adequately protected when they were not.Massachusetts spent about $2 million for the masks in the Patriots’ shipment, Torgerson said.She did not directly respond to a question about whether Massachusetts officials knew some of the masks they were buying from China were KN95. “Most of the masks available from China are KN95,” she said.Sharon Torgerson, a spokeswoman for the state’s COVID-19 Response Command Center, said this week that the masks in that shipment were “a combination of KN95 and N95.”At the time of that shipment, Governor Charlie Baker repeatedly described the masks as N95s, but many turned out to be KN95s. State officials said they have received additional masks from the federal government that are also KN95s.. . . And many health care workers in Massachusetts have been wary; earlier this month, several questioned the quality of the KN95 masks the state received from China in an April 2 shipment brought by the New England Patriots team plane.“We had the masks out there for quite some time before we found out about the deficiencies,” said Brockton Police Chief Emanuel Gomes. “They were in daily police use. . . . Officers were using these on every call.”But on Friday, the department received notice from the agency that new tests showed the masks to be severely deficient, filtering just 28 percent of airborne particles — far below what is considered safe for front-line workers. The department immediately recalled the masks.When the Brockton Police Department received hundreds of protective respirator masks from the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency earlier this month, they came as a welcome gift to officers increasingly worried about exposure in the line of duty. The masks were soon distributed to each of the department’s 200 sworn personnel. More were packed into kits and placed inside cruisers.Now fast-forward to “We all know this pandemic is being fought across the globe and we couldn’t have accomplished what we’ve done here without willing partners in China that worked with us to bring this to fruition,” Baker said. “Ambassador Huang Ping at the Chinese consulate in New York was instrumental with the success of this effort.”Gov. Charlie Baker, who came up with the idea to get the Patriots’ team plane involved, praised the Krafts, two other governors and even numerous Chinese officials and government agencies for getting the respirator masks to front-line health care workers.Let us close the week by taking a second look of that much-covered and much-praised account of masks from Chinese manufacturers being brought to Massachusetts on the New England Patriots plane. <strong>The Chinese Did <em>Not</em> Help Massachusetts Personnel</strong>There is this weird wave of pro-Beijing cheerleading going on right now, and I can’t tell whether it’s anti-Trumpism run amok, it reflects the parent companies of media institutions having extensive business interests in China, or whether some American elites look at the stability and social control of authoritarian China and see a system they would like to emulate. It may not matter that much; Just what on earth is going on here?From this coverage, you would have no idea that Even coverage of the regime’s draconian steps to contain the virus are spun as demonstrations of toughness and resolution. <a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-04-13/xi-jinping-won-coronavirus-crisis"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""><em>Foreign Affairs</em> ran an essay with the headline</a>Back on March 26, NBC News declared, “Our Jack Butler noticed an “analysis” piece over at CNN declaring, “Bill Gates insists “In I’m not that worried about those conspiracy theorists, who are mostly on the fringe and preach to the already converted. I am much more worried about prominent Americans who look at this ongoing global calamity — more than 3.3 million cases and 234,000 deaths worldwide, as of this writing — and conclude that the Chinese government is the hero in this story. Right now, a surprising number of prominent Americans are loudly insisting that China has handled this virus outbreak correctly, and the United States has not. The U.S. federal, state, and local governments have made their share of mistakes in this crisis. But that doesn’t make Beijing the good guys or role models.But by and large, the people touting the theory that this is a deliberately engineered and deliberately released bioweapon are easily spotted conspiracy theorists. No, it is not surprising that It doesn’t help that there are genuine conspiracy theorists out there arguing that this was a bioweapon, and that China was willing to expose many of its own citizens in order to harm the rest of the world. It also doesn’t help that a lot of people, in the general public and media alike, keep using the term “made in a lab” — meaning deliberately engineered — and “originated in a lab” — meaning came from an animal or sample being used for testing — interchangeably.I’ve got no beef — no pun intended — with someone who looks at all the evidence and says, “I think the virus originating from an animal brought to the market is more likely.” That’s a very reasonable suspicion — As “There are far too many examples of lab accidents. Our own CDC and everyone else has had accidents, even with very dangerous agents,” Relman said. “There is simply no way around it, since humans are flawed — inconsistent, distractible — creatures.”David Relman, a Stanford University professor of microbiology, said the outbreak at a minimum underscores the need for more stringent standards and comprehensive monitoring of research involving pathogens with the ability to inflict widespread harm on human health and economies.While the source of the outbreak ultimately may be unknowable, the claim that the laboratory could not have been involved in the virus’s release “is not credible,” said Richard Ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University.“Maintenance cost is generally neglected; several high-level BSLs [biological safety level labs] have insufficient operating funds for routine, yet vital processes,” said the paper by Yuan Zhiming, a chief scientist at Wuhan, published in the Journal of Biosafety and Biosecurity. Most laboratories “lack specialized biosafety managers and engineers,” he wrote.Records of accidents in U.S. labs reveal multiple inadvertent infections and exposures to lethal microbes, including the pathogens linked to anthrax, Ebola and the plague. While no comparable records are available for Chinese labs, a Chinese scientific paper last year described widespread systemic deficiencies with training and monitoring of high-security laboratories where disease-causing pathogens are studied.TheA lot of media institutions cite a quote from a virologist expressing skepticism of the theory, or touting the professionalism of Chinese scientists, and more or less conclude, “case closed.” I think the only way this will be definitively ruled out is if some biologist can determine, beyond any conceivable doubt, that SARS-CoV-2 had to pass through a pangolin before jumping into humans.

But we will pay a terrible price along the way.While there are several different ways the “waves” of infection could progress, the University of Minnesota report concludes “whichever scenario the pandemic follows (assuming at least some level of ongoing mitigation measures), we must be prepared for at least another 18 to 24 months of significant COVID-19 activity, with hot spots popping up periodically in diverse geographic areas.”The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the The CEO of Gilead, the company that makes remdesivir, The worst is over, but the months to come are not going to be “good” but merely “less bad.” All in all, we’re probably living with this virus affecting our lives for one to two years, unless there is a breakthrough and really speedy production and distribution of a vaccine.We are likely through the worst. Thankfully, only a small percentage of hospitals received more patients than they could handle. Most hospitals ended up starved for patients.  Some parts of the country are on the downside of the curve — particularly the ones that were hit the hardest in late March and throughout April. Other parts of the country are still on the incline.The number of daily new cases nationwide Yes, you can argue the official death count is likely an over-count because it counts cases that are suspected to be driven by the virus, but not confirmed. You can also argue the official death count is likely an under-count because the We are now four weeks and two days into that five-week period. In that time, the number of confirmed cases in the United States has increased from 168,177 to nearly 1.1 million; the number of deaths has increased from 4,066 to more than 64,000.If we can get through the next five weeks, the worst will probably be behind us.But here’s what we know: For the last week, the number of new cases is increasing by anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000 each day. Yes, some of that increase reflects more widespread testing. Yes, many of those people will recover without needing hospitalization… Hang on, hang tough, try to stay out of a hospital if you don’t need emergency treatment.Everything we are seeing right now indicates that the coming five weeks or so are going to be brutal. You can quibble with this projection or that projection, because all of them are trying to account for a million little variables that aren’t easily seen: How strong are the immune systems of those currently infected? How well will the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatments work? How well are health authorities keeping the virus out of nursing homes and retirement communities? How much are people practicing social distancing? We’re hoping the worst projections are wrong — and perhaps they’re so scary, they spur people to take additional steps to stop the spread and prevent the bad outcomes that they project.<a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/we-have-a-difficult-five-weeks-ahead-of-us/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Back on March 30, I wrote</a>National ReviewFollow Us",0,We Are Nearly Done with the Worst Five Weeks of Virus Hell

They’ll end just as they began: with the American people taking the lead because their elected officials can’t or won’t, muddling their way through an impossible dilemma.  
   Nature is not obliged to cooperate with our civilization, however much we might wish it were. A disease could always come along that wrecks our arrangements for good. A previous civilization on the American continent was destroyed by plague. But humans have a nature too, and the present lockdowns cannot be sustained without the proper combination of hope for sufficient federal aid and fear of the virus that satisfies it.  
   If they can’t — if government institutions cannot tie public health and the economy together in a collective national effort — then Americans can, must, and will begin to divide and make their own arrangements. Non-essential workers who can will work illicitly. People will get into screaming matches over masks and personal space in grocery stores until new social norms emerge.We haven’t gotten consistent answers to such questions, and it has left us unsure. In some cases, this confusion was understandable; there is no good science on a new virus. But if they expect continued compliance, authorities have to be clear, consistent, and honest about what their experts are telling them, and about how confident they are in its accuracy. In the absence of sounder science more soundly communicated, the public will act upon its own understandable anxiety and take signs of abatement as signs of hope, or even invitations to begin rebuilding their lives, livelihoods, and businesses. If the authorities find this behavior foolish, then they must persuade us through intelligent legislative acts, provision, and publicity.The lockdowns began with both suspicion and trust. The suspicion was that China wouldn’t shut down its industrial heartland and Italians wouldn’t give up their lives as free citizens for nothing. The trust was that our scientists were right. That Americans have cooperated so widely and readily with social-distancing directives is astonishing. But they have done so based on the conviction that COVID-19 was roughly twice as transmissible as the flu, and possibly ten times as deadly. Is that true in every environment? Every region? Every climate? Does avoiding a doubling and redoubling of the awful American death toll require this sustained and intrusive lockdown? Or can masks and a little more care and circumspection do the trick?It is, of course, a good thing that New York didn’t become Northern Italy, and that although there have been scary weeks in Seattle, Detroit, and New Orleans, none of those cities became New York. But when is the conversation going to change to reflect as much?
Elsewhere, even our successes have come with unanticipated downsides. The lockdown policies were justified by the imperative of “flattening the curve.” That meant slowing the transmission of the disease to avoid the catastrophic medical-system collapses that sent death rates into truly scary territory in Wuhan, China and Northern Italy. And for the most part, we’ve done this. New York needed fewer ventilators than estimated. The naval-ship hospital has already left city’s waters. The curve is flattened so much that stories of New York emergency rooms filling to the brim have been crowded out by stories of hospitals that are eerily empty. People fearful of contracting the virus have delayed seeking medical attention for other problems. With elective surgeries cancelled, hospitals are actually laying off staff to balance the books. We’ve flattened the curve so much to prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed that they’re now in greater danger of being underwhelmed.Perhaps it was inevitable that all those hopes would be dashed.None of those assumptions has held up. Congress accepted and arguably exacerbated the mass unemployment the pandemic immediately left in its wake. Its limits on “paycheck protection” loans and other small-business aid turned its relief program into a lottery. Talk of increasing test capacity to millions per day has turned out to be just that — talk. Guidelines for re-opening at the state level have proposed hopelessly vague metrics. And federal guidelines, while more sound upon examination, have not been publicized.So now we face a serious dilemma. It goes something like this: We don’t have enough money to stay idle, but we don’t have enough confidence in testing to go out and spend again. The COVID-19 social contract was cobbled together at alarming speed. Everyone quickly adopted three assumptions: First, that the government would compensate — and, as much as possible, make whole — those men and women who, for the sake of public health, lost income, business, or their livelihoods; second, that we would in due course build the kind of mass testing-and-contact-tracing system that would allow us to isolate the sick, rather than locking down everybody; and third, that we would adopt clear benchmark conditions for re-opening, and clear, universal guidelines on masks, handshakes, hygiene, and the like to be followed until we had a vaccine.<span class=""drop"">F</span>

Ohio, Texas, Alabama, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Arkansas sought to temporarily block abortions during the public health emergency, although they have been largely unsuccessful after being met with legal challenges.Despite having small affiliates across the country that employ fewer than 500 people, Planned Parenthood’s corporate structure precludes it from eligibility for the funds, the administration said.

					© 2020 National Review				Our Capital Letter email newsletter delivers a weekly digest on finance, business, and economics from an NR sensibility.Though Powell’s approach is merited by the bleak economic outlook, it could amount to a Faustian bargain. If he lets asset prices fall in the coming weeks and months, the big bazooka of accommodative policy early in the crisis will have been for naught. Bailing out a divided Congress with further monetary accommodation will make fiscal stimulus less likely. But digging in further will require an even greater divergence from conventional monetary policy and feed into the mispricing of risk in asset markets. Financial markets cannot remain on life support indefinitely.Should asset prices continue to fall, it’s safe to assume that the Fed will take further action. At the FOMC press conference on Wednesday, Powell pledged to use his “full range of tools to support the U.S. economy,” including an expansion of current loan programs. But he also emphasized the need for more fiscal stimulus, signaling that the Fed cannot carry water for Congress indefinitely. While an initial $2.2 trillion Senate spending package passed with relatively little partisan bickering, the growing dispute over state bankruptcies suggests that future stimulus debates will be more contentious.As with mechanical ventilation, however, liquidity provisions do not treat the underlying disease: Economic shutdowns persist, and no COVID-19 treatment or vaccine is yet available. Market exuberance has not kept 30 million Americans from filing for unemployment. Constrained by an inability to take risk and by limits on the size of its holdings, the Fed can only put a floor under asset prices for so long. The sugar rush of money-printing now seems to be running out. With the S&P 500 index down roughly 4 percent over the past two days, warnings from investors that equities would test new lows are coming to fruition.Under monetary easing mediated through financial institutions, the Fed brings down borrowing costs by reducing the risk-free interest rate, but asset prices still reflect idiosyncratic risks. By holding debt in corporations directly, the Fed indiscriminately suppressed risk premia, such that firms disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 crisis would face similar borrowing costs to those less affected. Seeing that the Fed would prop up corporate balance sheets irrespective of risk, investors piled into risk assets. With the money machine running full throttle, the shortest bear market in history turned into a rally: Stocks gained 30 percent from their March 23 bottom.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Then, in an unprecedented move, the Fed stepped into corporate-debt markets directly. Instead of channeling liquidity through banks, in keeping with long-held norms, the Fed took on the role of lender of last resort to corporations themselves. Its Primary and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities extended credit to investment-grade firms and even “fallen angels” that had suffered rating downgrades in the pandemic’s wake. The new lending facilities, which also included municipalities and medium-sized businesses, turned the Fed into the single biggest debt-originator in the U.S., with its balance sheet growing at a rate of $41 billion a day.Those interventions did not stave off a bear market, which hit in mid-March as the pandemic spread through the U.S. In response, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee brought interest rates to zero and initiated quantitative easing, buying assets from banks. While unprecedented in magnitude and haste, the Fed’s measures would have a muted impact: Lowering borrowing costs increases aggregate demand in normal times, but the pandemic has made most forms of consumption virtually impossible. Still, Fed chair Jay Powell made clear that he was willing to take forceful, immediate action to buoy markets, and investors took note: The selloff receded.As public-health officials raced to procure ventilators, economic policymakers put the financial system on life support with massive infusions of cash. First, the Federal Reserve stepped into the Treasury and repurchase-agreement markets, where demand for cash had raised short-term borrowing rates. The Fed’s purchases of short-term debt allowed financial markets to withstand some of the pressures of the coronavirus selloff. Soon thereafter, the Fed intervened in the commercial-paper and money markets as well.The economic fallout from the coronavirus has caused its own kind of oxygen shortage in the markets: a liquidity shortfall. The financial system relies on the constant flow of money. If that flow is halted, it can aggravate any underlying distress.<span class=""drop"">I</span>

At Dr. Blight cites Douglass’ 1869 speech “Our Composite Nationality” as the cornerstone of his argument in order to make the case that Douglass had a view of race akin to the modern pluralist. For instance, he quotes the following from Douglass: “Joy and sorrow speak alike in all nations, and they above all the confusion of tongues proclaim the brotherhood of man.” This seems to imply that all peoples are the same and that America ought to be a cosmopolitan, post-racial society. Dr. Blight leaves out some important context in using this quotation. Throughout the speech, Douglass stresses the duties required of citizens and the immense work it takes to form and sustain political society. America may be composed of many races, but there are principles that must be held in common. Dr. Blight notes that his excerpt of Douglass shows that the country would hold true to “universal values,” but he fails to account for the duties of the citizenry of all races to subscribe to those “values.” Douglass’ conclusion has more complex implications than Dr. Blight admits. Douglass believed that there were universal principles that bound together “our composite nationality,” and that all races therein have equal duties they must uphold as American citizens.In 5.

At No one contests that the pandemic constitutes an emergency and that with an emergency some unusual measures are unavoidable. But the fragility of human health in a way constitutes a permanent urgency and may provide the State with a permanent justification for a permanent state of emergency. We now see in the State only the protector of our rights; now, since life is the first of our rights, a broad path is opened up to the State’s inquisitorial power. That said, we gave ourselves over to the State long ago, according it sovereignty over our lives. This long-term tendency has become more acute in recent years. The spontaneity of public speech has been subjected to a kind of prior censorship, which in effect has excluded legitimate debate on most of the important questions of our common life, or even of our personal lives. Whether the question is migration or relations between the sexes and related social questions, an ideology common to society and the State dictates what is permitted and prohibited, which is the same as what is honorable and shameful, noble and vile. In a word, we have altogether internalized the principle of a code of speech and expression, which it is considered suspect to resist. Thus have we quietly left behind the liberal and democratic regime that was informed and animated by rival collective projects, and which presented us with great undertakings, common actions to accomplish, good and bad, judicious and ruinous, but which gave us reasons to put up a good fight, occasions for vigorous argument, and great questions nourishing great disagreements. This happy time is gone. Our world is full of victims who, in a voice that is at once whining and threatening, claim to be wounded by all this talk. They see in the grammatical rules governing gender an offense to all women and find homophobic insult in schoolboy profanity. How can we now oppose the State as guardian of rights while we beg it to intrude into our ever-wounded personal lives?3. In 1989, when Chinese citizens raised a Goddess of Democracy on Tiananmen Square, some pinned their hopes on the People’s Liberation Army: Surely the people’s army would never fire on the people. In fact, PLA soldiers proved quite adept at firing on the people. And to this day Beijing refuses to come clean about how many it killed at Tiananmen.Chinese Communism has particularly benefited from the West’s naiveté. When Maoism first appeared, it was hailed as a more authentic and humane form of communism than its brutal Soviet rival. Then came the persecutions and purges and the Cultural Revolution, which left millions of innocent Chinese dead in its wake.Communism has always been far more about Lenin than Marx—that is, about getting and holding power, rather than any economic arrangement. And it’s extraordinary how consistent the lies and violence have been across time and geography, given the many different flavors of communism. There’s scarcely a Communist Party in the world that doesn’t have a mass killing or two in its past.2. At theThe incident prompted a furious response from the Vietnamese government, which accused Beijing of violating its sovereignty and threatening the lives of its fishermen. The US State Department So far in April, there were The arrival of China’s While the rest of the world is preoccupied with tackling the coronavirus pandemic, China is intensifying its efforts to extend its influence in the South China Sea by intimidating its Asian neighbours.1. At Gatestone Institute, Con Coughlin takes on Communist China’s attempt to exploit the pandemic to increase its power regionally. <strong>The Six</strong>The collision of cultures is recorded in a passage that deserves a place in any anthology to do with human nature and its extremes. Speaking to a cadet, John resorted to a Japanese word meaning “bad, inadequate.” Like someone possessed, the cadet reacted with a rant, frothing at the mouth, sending for his sword and preparing to behead the kneeling prisoner who had given such offense. John in fact saved himself by knowing and reciting what the victim is supposed to say ritually before the sword ends his life. The cadet dropped his sword, burst into tears and invited John to have some cake and a cup of tea, the one and only time when the slave laborer was treated as a guest. John’s misuse of language was wiped away because he had proved his respect for the whole culture.Enrolled in the Intelligence Corps, he arrived in Singapore in January 1942, disastrously timed for the Japanese to take him prisoner. He had learned enough of the language to be an interpreter. “Navigating through the labyrinthine Japanese mind,” he writes, “was, after food, everyone’s favourite intellectual occupation.” In Changi he had an inconceivably far-fetched encounter with Fujita, the well-known painter and a friend in Paris days but now an Official War Artist, who greeted him, “Mon pauvre ami, je ne vous demande pas ce que vous faites ici” (My poor friend, I don’t ask you what you are doing here). Sadism and sentimentality were an incomprehensible combination.3. In which David reflects on John StewartBob had spent the Sixties studying Soviet demographic statistics and census returns in order to measure as accurately as possible the drastic fall in population brought about by Stalin’s criminal policies. Communism was to the 20th century what sorcery had been to the Middle Ages. The claim of the foundational doctrine of Marxism to be a science was pure witchcraft. Something known as the dialectic was said to be the key to progress, but nobody could make sense of this figment. The state was supposed to wither away, leaving us all to look after ourselves as though back in the Garden of Eden, yet in the starkest of contradictions the Communist state granted itself ever more total power over the individual in every aspect of daily life. The organizing principle of class became a sentence of death, exile, or dispossession for tens of millions of men and women defined as bourgeois, capitalist, kulak, or whatever could be profitably exploited.My friendship with Bob goes back to 1963 when he was foreign editor of the 2. In which David discusses Could the restaurant where we took our meals really have been called Nausea? The place had its comic turn too. A man alleged to be the Icelandic national poet was lying at the foot of the bar. Every so often he would haul himself up, point a finger, and bellow, “I know you! You are Hungarian, yes! But not Koestler — your name is Istvan Szabo!” and then relapse to his position on the floor. A reporter once more, Koestler was in his element. “He sniffs the air with animal awareness,” I wrote in my diary. “He makes me think of an otter, trim, the coat in tip-top condition.”Once in Reykjavik, we stepped straight into slapstick. Bobby Fischer had not arrived and might never leave the United States. The opening ceremony was held in a dark half-empty theater without him. According to the grapevine, Spassky was longing to give an interview to Westerners but could not escape the KGB agents escorting him. So we went to his hotel and found him and half a dozen KGB in one of the public rooms on the first floor. He made for the lift and so did we. On the landing, the KGB froze him out, and managed to crowd all non-Russians into the lift and then deposit them on the ground floor.Koestler happened to be ahead of me as I was boarding the flight to Iceland and so we took seats together. It was the first week of July 1972 and we were off to cover the Spassky-Fischer chess championship, he for 1. In which David This week past we celebrated the publication of NR senior editor David Pryce-Jones’ new book, <strong><em>Signatures</em></strong>My father, a university professor with a doctorate in music education, was continually correcting his sons away from such speech. My mother and grandparents did, too. If I’d been born to a different family, I might well have spent my life speaking the West Texas dialect. But then maybe not: The English teachers in Canyon were also constantly correcting their pupils’ grammar and pronunciation in the 1960s and 1970s.While growing up in a small college town in the Texas Panhandle, I was exposed to both educated speech and the regional dialect. Some of my friends’ parents would say things like It don’t make me no never mind. Although I never adopted that particular locution, I did as a child often say things like Me and Leslie are fixin’ to go to the store.This change in approach marks an about-face in education. In essence, it makes the learning of Standard English optional. It dooms many speakers of English to the dialect into which they were born. It also liberates English teachers by letting them skip English-language lessons and focus entirely on literature, which for many is the more enjoyable aspect of the curriculum.The core idea among many educators is that we shouldn’t stigmatize regional and class speech habits because that’s equivalent to teaching children that their parents are uneducated or socially unacceptable. Given that most children learn language from their parents, linguistic correction would supposedly damage those children’s self-esteem.4. Bryan Garner, in his new “Grammarian” column, commences a three-part series he’s calling “Killing Grammar.” The case against Catholics in preRevolutionary Massachusetts was that their religious beliefs made it impossible to integrate them into the political system of the time, which was true: In colonial Massachusetts, church and state were effectively united. Later anti-Catholic animus elaborated on that point, and anti-Catholic polemicists in the Revolutionary era argued that Catholics could not be good republicans and democrats, that they were instinctive monarchists, that they were religiously and culturally incompatible with American-style liberty. (One sometimes hears similar arguments about Muslims today.) That the First Amendment would give license to “popery” was a lively concern in the 18th century.Professor Bartholet’s aggressive secularism is, ironically, a variation on an old American political tendency in Puritanism. The anti-Catholicism of Puritan New England is difficult for contemporary Americans to appreciate. A Catholic priest could be put to death in colonial Massachusetts simply for being present in the territory. (It is not clear how stringently this law was enforced, though Massachusetts did hang Quakers.) Catholic Mass could not be legally celebrated in much of New England, and Catholics were legally second-class citizens in Massachusetts until well into the 19th century, when the state constitution was amended.3. Know-Nothing Redux: Kevin Williamson profiles the homeschool invaders at the Landscapers and lawn crews were idled, too, at a time when they should have been revving up. “Normally we’d be cleaning up yards, removing sticks and leaves, and making our first cuts,” says Spike Lewis of TLC Lawn Care. Lewis, who works by himself, also employs a couple of mowers who operate as a two-man team. They rarely see customers when they work. Lewis bills by mail. “I understand being safe, but I don’t understand why we can’t be out there. Why does she have to shut us down?”Todd Ritchey, the owner of White’s Welding, chose to shut down in March. Whitmer’s order had blocked him from even the simplest jobs, such as repairing a broken metal gate. “I was going to stay open, but when people stayed at home, business dropped off.” He thinks closing the sake of safety, but he says that he and a lot of others need to get back to work soon: “If you make a living at something, then it’s essential. I don’t care if you sell butterfly magnets.”The state government couldn’t get its story straight in other areas either. On April 3, a spokesman for the Michigan State Police told the 2. There’s mucho COVID confusion in Michigan. John J. Miller is on the scene to recount the madness. In 1988, Jesse Jackson led Stanford students in the chant, “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Western Civ has got to go!” The protests attracted national headlines and inspired a television debate between the university’s president and William Bennett, then secretary of education. Bill King, the president of the Stanford Black Student Union, claimed at that time, “By focusing these ideas on all of us they are crushing the psyche of those others to whom Locke, Hume, and Plato are not speaking. . . . The Western culture program as it is presently structured around a core list and an outdated philosophy of the West being Greece, Europe, and Euro-America is wrong, and worse, it hurts people mentally and emotionally.” He presented no actual evidence that reading Locke, Hume, or Plato has ever hurt anyone mentally or emotionally, and that was of course decades before the snowflake generation could proclaim themselves offended by the “micro-aggression” of a raised eyebrow.Mention of the Alhambra in Granada prompts the thought that any course in Western civilization worth its name ought also to include the Umayyad Caliphate, of which Córdoba  in modern-day Spain was the capital between 756 and 929. In the wake of the conquest of Spain and the establishment of the Muslim confederacy of Al-Andalus, Córdoba  became a flourishing, polyglot, multicultural environment in which religious tolerance, despite Jews’ and Christians’ being obliged to pay a supplementary tax to the state, produced an atmosphere of intellectual progressiveness that made it one of the most important cities in the world. Discoveries in trigonometry, pharmacology, astronomy, and surgery can all be traced to Córdoba. At a certain point, then, a very particular set of historical circumstances produced an equally particular set of intellectual ideas, which had significant material consequences. The study of Western civilization is therefore emphatically not solely that of Christian DWEMs.1. Hey, when your lead essay is Andrew Roberts on the necessity of teaching Western Civilization, you’ve got a humdinger of an issue. As is the custom in these here parts, we share four examples of brilliance from the <strong>The Fortnight Has Arrived, Bringing with It the New Edition of America’s Leading Conservative Magazine</strong>Godard talks us through film culture’s now-paralyzed state: Owing to social-distancing shutdowns and distributors’ frozen release schedules (not just in the U.S. but across the globe), cinema is no longer a communal art. The unavoidable capitulation to television and digital streaming means we’re drifting further away from movie aesthetics and film history. The all-important spatial dimensions of bringing the world — especially the human face — intimately close are being lost, and so is the idea of larger-than-life discovery.In the absence of proper new movie openings, Jean-Luc Godard’s Instagram interview by Swiss filmmaker Lionel Baier, who heads the cinema department at the University of Art and Design in Lausanne, Switzerland, momentarily revives movie culture. This almost-two-hour interview has lit up the Internet.18. Armond White checks out the Jean-Luc Godard interview. It was, above all, confusing. The confusion is with us, still.I was present as a young student journalist for some of that drama, although, as was true for most of the media there, what I saw was mostly other media, a fantastical display of lights out in the otherwise dark countryside, a scene having the atmosphere of a kind of grim county fair. A couple of photographers with whom I worked at the University of Texas newspaper were detained by authorities for crossing the police cordon in pursuit of a better shot. (The photographers from my college newspaper staff, a rowdy but gifted bunch, went on to collectively earn four Pulitzer prizes in photography their first few years out of college.) It was a little like an NFL game: You want to be there in person, but you really get a better view on television.The Branch Davidian story is shocking, and it has not lost its power to alarm. For those who do not remember the 1990s (which are turning out to be a decade of our history almost as fiercely contested as the 1960s), the events depicted must seem both unlikely and grotesque: an ATF publicity stunt that turned into a bloodbath, a siege, and, finally, a horrifying fire that took the lives of 76 people trapped inside the compound, including 25 children and two pregnant women.17. Kevin Williamson catches Museums are getting PPP money. San Francisco’s MoMA got $6.2 million. That’ll keep its staff on the payroll until June 30. That money is meant for small businesses, and SF MoMa isn’t a small business, but it’s a sloppy law, and the museum is entitled to the money.The Payroll Protection Plan is the oddest program. The leaders of Congress — a big red flag, as Art certainly told me more than once that politicians are sleazy — conceived and passed this $358 billion program in about the same amount of time it takes to make a good osso buco — another big red flag.I think museums are doing what they can to take care of their people. That said, a museum shouldn’t keep an army of guards or visitor-amenities staff on the payroll if there are no visitors and museums are closed. That’s an abuse of the philanthropy that pays a museum’s bills. The Met was very nice to protect its people for a few weeks on its own dime, but it’s got a big deficit to close. Unemployment insurance exists to help people who are laid off. If they’re upset, their beef isn’t with the museums. It’s with the knuckleheads who closed the economy in the most reckless adventure since we went all guns blazing in search of those weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.The elegant Dr. Birx and the new geriatric pop star Dr. Fauci admit that quarantining an entire country and crashing a world economy to fight a virus have never been tried before. That in itself is a big red flag. NEA’s $50,000-a-pop plan doesn’t begin to address the uncharted territory museums face.16. Brian Allen has a thing or three to say about how the National Endowment of the Arts is spending its $75 million in Coronavirus relief. Critics might object that President Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA two years ago, so Washington has no standing to engage its snapback provision. But it’s not that simple.The State Department is promoting a new Security Council resolution that would extend the embargo indefinitely, which is certain to face opposition from Russia or China, both of whom have veto power. It would be smarter to simply activate the “snapback” mechanism in the JCPOA, restoring the entire pre-agreement U.N. sanctions regime and killing the deal for good.The U.S. is Is the United States still a participant in the Iran nuclear deal? Well, yes and no.15. James Robbins revisits the Iran Deal and suggests an end to it all. Despite all of this, however, there is still no sign that the prime minister will change his mind on Huawei. On April 21, the top-ranking official in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said that “the government has made a firm decision to allow Huawei to have a role” and that, as far as he knew, the decision was “not being reopened.” If the official is right, unwelcome repercussions are inevitable. The American government has made its concerns plain; Australia, likewise. The British public’s concern is shared by growing numbers of U.K. politicians. In early March, backbench MPs from the ruling Conservative Party staged a rebellion over Huawei, against their own government. More MPs have since rallied to the cause. Earlier this month, a new parliamentary group was established to review U.K.–China relations. It is led by Tom Tugendhat, an MP known for trenchant criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).Britain is the only Five Eyes partner to permit a role for Huawei in its 5G system. The others regard Huawei involvement as a serious threat to national security. The British government’s decision, taken in January, to admit Huawei came after years of intense debate at home and abroad. Britain’s allies now look on in alarm as a pillar of NATO and the rules-based international order takes a course that will likely undermine the security of its data — and of data shared by others.14. Matthew Henderson argues that the U.K. should walk away from the Huawei / 5G deal. The unintended consequences of this bill would either be (a) more business failures, meaning more debt defaults, unemployment, and contagion effects throughout that company’s vendor network, or (b) the additional leveraging of companies that are already in distress with an almost inevitably negative effect on their future growth, and with that their ability to increase wages and hire more workers.What happens if an opportunistic buyer is legally banned from taking an equity position in a distressed company? It is worth remembering that acquisitions cannot be closed without 13. David Bahnsen kicks the idiotic AOC/Warren idea to ban mergers and acquisitions right in the choppers. In his essay, Biden’s high-achieving adviser, one of the architects of Obamacare, judges the value of a life by the number of books a person can write or the number of technocratic laws they can help pass or the number of times they can climb Kilimanjaro. Did you know that the average age that Nobel Prize–winning physicists make their great discoveries is 48? Really, after that our feeble minds are “constricting of our ambitions and expectations.”While some of us believe age is catching up to Biden — time waits for no one, etc. — we still believe his life is more than political aspirations. Does Emanuel?It’s quite simple: Does Emanuel believe that Biden, aged 78 on Inauguration Day, is faltering or declining, or in a state that may not be worse than death but is nonetheless deprived? Does Emanuel consider Biden to have been robbed of his ability to contribute to work, society, and the world? Does he believe that Biden will now be remembered as feeble, ineffectual, and even pathetic? Is Biden’s creativity, originality, and productivity pretty much gone? Surely a younger person, according to Emanuel’s own societal prescription, would be better prepared for the job.I suspect that if one of Trump’s advisers on coronavirus had once taken to the august pages of 12. Kevorkian Redux. Another Harsanyi beaut — here he bemoans Joe Biden’s health-care guru, the unsettling Ezekiel Emanuel. Few have accurate figures on recent optional wars. But general estimates put the 19-year-long Afghanistan war at $2 trillion, and the 2003-08 active war in Iraq at another $2 trillion — with more than 7,000 American deaths in action or related to both wars.World War II, aside from well over 400,00 American dead and the resulting generations of disability and mental-health issues, cost the U.S. in modern currency over $4 trillion, despite turning a lingering Depression-era economy into a global juggernaut. No doubt the actual related expense was trillions of dollars higher.Critics of the F-35 joint-strike fighter claim that it will cost in toto over $1.5 trillion in all related costs during its lifespan. We have no idea how they can come up with that number, only that the plane is far more expensive than what was initially promised. The interstate highway system’s first phases probably cost around $500 billion in today’s money — and saved hundreds of thousands of lives in its first few years.NASA’s various space programs probably have cost far more than the often cited $1 trillion price. But going to the moon likely more than paid for itself in a variety of ways — in spin-off industries, new technologies, invaluable scientific data, and the emergence of a new sense of increased national prestige.11. Victor Davis Hanson looks at existential efforts in American history and compares them to “Our Corona Project.” While Rebarber is focused on national-level results, he also homes in on some particularly revealing data from the states. Kentucky fully implemented Common Core three years ahead of most other states, yet it continues to register declines in reading and math. That means prospects for a turnaround in other states in the coming years are dim.With trenchant analysis, buttressed by powerful, easy-to-read graphics, Rebarber shows that since the advent of Common Core, slow but steady yearly gains in math and reading have been turned into sustained national declines in student achievement. In other words, whereas America’s reading and math scores had once been headed up, Common Core has brought them down. What’s worse, declines in test scores have been sharpest for the bottom half of the student population. The whole point of Common Core was to strengthen the performance of low-achieving students relative to the top-of-the-pack. So Common Core has actually hurt the students it was most intended to help.With six years of data subsequent to full implementation now available, the failure of Common Core can at last be decisively documented. That is precisely what Boston’s 10. Stanley Kurtz documents the failure that is Common Core and asks — now what?

Consequence Envy: Poor Max Boot, haunted by the ghost of Phyllis Schlafly, his new bête noire. John Hirschauer has the back of the late conservative who bested the ERA. Griffith’s most egregious propagandizing concerns the Chinese government itself, which deserves most of the blame for the spread of COVID-19. Griffiths seems eager to whitewash that government’s conduct and undercut its critics’ valid concerns. It is “debatable how communist modern China actually is,” Griffiths offers. That may technically be true — China is no longer taking Great Leaps Forward, to be sure. But its political apparatus remains oppressive enough to send hundreds of thousands of Muslim Uighurs, a disfavored minority, to concentration camps. And, directly bearing on the crisis at hand, China engaged in typical totalitarian behavior by suppressing early knowledge of the infection’s spread. By imprisoning whistleblowers, it delayed public awareness of the virus’s spread by several weeks (something it had done before, in the 2003 SARS outbreak).But one would be mistaken. In a CNN “analysis,” James Griffiths admits that China’s leaders “have not been blind to the opportunity” that coronavirus presents to flaunt the supposed superiority of their own political model. Yet Griffiths then proceeds to toe the Beijing line on China’s handling of the coronavirus, America’s efforts, and the global implications of both. It’s propaganda thinly disguised as reporting.The most brazen such efforts belong to the Chinese Communist Party, which is now reinterpreting recent events to exploit the outbreak that its own actions and inactions caused. One would think that, CNN — a news organization that declares itself fond of speaking truth to power, that likes to 8. More MSM Bias: Jack Butler examines CNN’s footsy act with Red China. Earlier this month, she was the first to report that a “coalition of abortion rights groups” had responded to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals’ ruling in favor of Texas’s COVID-19 abortion restrictions. Her article noted that Texas was restricting “abortion access” and exclusively quoted pro-abortion activists, one from the Center for Reproductive Rights and one from NARAL Pro-Choice Texas.Let’s review Smith’s most recent work, starting with her verbal virtuosity. She tends to hide her liberal beliefs about abortion in devious language, referring to herself, for instance, as a reporter covering “abortion access” — a euphemism wielded exclusively by the most vigorous activists for unlimited legal abortion.But if you believe that’s what CBS is doing in employing Smith, you’d be wrong. Kate Smith is not a reporter at all. She is an advocate for abortion rights who exploits her perch at CBS to disguise as fact the opinions of the country’s most radical abortion-rights activists. She is Planned Parenthood’s ambassador to CBS, posing as a reporter and constructing articles that more closely resemble press releases for the nation’s most powerful abortion-rights advocacy groups. She has traded her objectivity for access to these organizations, offering them the kid-glove treatment so they will permit her to be the first to publicize their PR campaigns, interview their leaders, and scoop their briefs in court cases.7. Alexandra DeSanctis outs CBS correspondent Kate Smith as a de facto ambassador from Planned Parenthood. Arguing that unprejudiced hearings (and I’m still not sure why these cases aren’t adjudicated in civil and criminal court) are a tacit approval of rape is repulsive. Even worse: We now know Biden believes that allegations against The former vice president never actually spelled out his specific criticisms of DeVos’s proposal. In a In 2011, the 6. David Harsanyi scores the hypocrisy in #MeToo Biden. The bitter recall of ancient Chinese glories; resentment of past humiliations; insecurity bred by corruption and illegitimacy; disdain, even hatred of America’s easy ways — these are the pathogens coursing through Xi’s circle. A fever for Chinese primacy burns among them. For a time, they might pander to a Western-inspired, rules-based order, a liberal conceit; but this is not their dream. A historic economic rise, technological mastery, a rapidly expanding navy, all causes to be proud of, have freed them to be brazen. Xi now bares the teeth Deng Xiaoping’s smile hid. From South China Sea islets to the New Silk Road’s arid ends, the CCP, ruthless and defiant, pounds the stakes it holds to advance its aims. For Xi’s CCP, it is the fate of small states to bend to the strong.An angry narrative drives this man. Under his hand, the CCP highlights Chinese suffering and humiliation roughly a century ago under Western and Japanese imperialists, while eliding the democratic world’s helping hand and Japan’s benign democracy over four generations since. He slides past the Chinese millions massacred in the intervening decades by the CCP and Mao — China’s legendary leader who spread cruelty and death as he judged useful. In imitation of Mao, Xi has issued his own “little red book” of wisdom. Mao’s iconic image looms over Tiananmen still. Coveting Mao’s autocratic power, Xi strove and won it; now he dare not let it go.Such openness and grace have not been Xi’s way. As he built up islets in the South China Sea, he promised never to militarize them, then dishonored his promise, disregarded international rulings, and dispatched ships in packs to intimidate neighboring states and expand Beijing’s writ. Pledging to protect intellectual property, he enabled ongoing theft and coercion, ineluctably undermining industries of the advanced democracies, and then pressed forward on China’s newly gained advantages. His BRI professes to aid, then exploits poor countries’ weaknesses. Citing the betterment of all in the cause of greater China, he has imprisoned Uighurs, undermined Tibetan culture, and threatened the peaceful regional order that had enabled China’s rise. He violates treaty commitments to curb Hong Kong’s freedoms. Behind an anti-corruption façade, his prosecutors ruined scores of his rivals, as he consolidated and extended his personal powers. These wrongs he continues still. Xi’s are not the ways of grace and remorse.5. Scooter Libby sizes up the threat of Red China and its Mao-fascinated leader, Xi Jinping. In some ways, the gulf between the rich in China’s cities and the poor in its rural areas has been institutionalized through the longstanding “hukou” system of internal registration, which hampers movement between regions and creates what amounts to an economic caste system. While Xi has made hukou reform a priority in order to create greater opportunity for urban migration and prosperity, the system continues to reinforce the divide between urban haves and rural have-nots. As the former become wealthier and more global in their perspective, the disdain they frequently show for those who are different — whether from Africa or rural China — is becoming more pronounced.Han Chinese make up the same percentage of the population in Hong Kong as on the mainland, and are 97 percent of the population in Taiwan. Neither Hong Kongers nor Taiwanese have suffered any less at Xi’s hands for that. Nor, for that matter, have the 400 million mostly Han Chinese living on less than $5 a day in the country outside China’s megacities, who face vicious discrimination from urban elites.That said, there is a quality to the pattern of behavior in the PRC that transcends ethnicity. Chinese racial discrimination is horrifying in its own right, of course. But it also suggests a farther-reaching chauvinism that is emerging as the defining characteristic of the Xi era.4. Therese Shaheen recounts the ugly realities of Chicom chauvinism and its perspective on the rest of the world’s peoples. But The answer to the The new disclosures, in conjunction with all we have learned in the last week, answer the all-important Once you grasp that fundamental fact, it becomes easier to understand the Michael Flynn was not the objective. He was the obstacle.3. Even More Andy: It was a political perjury trap, and Flynn needed to be caught in it, if its perpetrators were to snag the big Prize, POTUS. As I’ve noted several times over the years, it has long been speculated that Flynn — though he did not believe he was guilty (and though the agents who interviewed him also did not believe he had intentionally misled them) — nevertheless pled guilty to false-statements charges because prosecutors from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s staff threatened him. Specifically, Flynn is said to have been warned that, if he refused to plead guilty, prosecutors would charge his son with a felony for failing to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent. Such a so-called FARA violation (Foreign Agent Registration Act) is a crime that the DOJ almost never charged before the Mueller investigation, and it had dubious application to Flynn’s son (who worked for Flynn’s private-intelligence firm).And that is far from the end of the matter.This goes to the point I’ve been pressing for years. 2. More Andy: He analyses the explosive revelations in the government’s shoddy case against General Flynn. After Obama fired him from the DIA post, Flynn became an important Trump-campaign surrogate, which gave him a national media platform from which to rip Obama’s foreign policy. When Trump won the election, Flynn is a retired Army lieutenant general, who made his mark on modern insurgent warfare by helping revolutionize the rapid dissemination of battlefield intelligence. He was promoted by President Obama to lead the Defense Intelligence Agency. He is also a headstrong man who got himself on Obama’s bad side by questioning counterterrorism strategy, particularly the administration’s weakness on Iran. He was detested by Obama political and national-security officials for calling them out on politicizing intelligence. The FBI was not a fan, least of all Deputy Director Andy McCabe, because Flynn had supported an Could anything have made the Obama administration giddier than the prospect of making a criminal case on Michael Flynn?1. Andy McCarthy laid it out in his smashing book, <strong>High-Calorie and Nutritious National Review Intellectual Goodness Awaits, But Remember to Chew Each Piece 32 Times</strong>De Blasio launched a broadside against “the Jewish community” after a large crowd turned out for a rabbi’s funeral in Williamsburg as though the event corporately implicated the more than 1 million Jews living in New York City, drawing criticism from the city’s ADL and other local Jewish leaders.De Blasio moved with much less dispatch than did colleagues in California and Ohio, among other places. And then, after dawdling for so long, de Blasio flipped. We always are happy to see a politician amend his views to accommodate new facts, but Slowpoke de Blasio’s subsequent overcompensation, and the sanctimony and viciousness he brings to the effort, is something else.De Blasio did manage to name his wife as head of a coronavirus-recovery panel. He always has time for that sort of thing. Mrs. de Blasio is fresh off of watching $1 billion walk out the door while overseeing a fruitless mental-health initiative. She has time on her hands and is rumored to be considering a run for elected office herself.Ignoring the advice and recommendations of the relevant experts in order to tend to his political concerns, Mayor de Blasio effectively became a member of that class of villain most hated by his progressive allies: a 3. Own it, de Blasio! Overall, it’s impossible to exaggerate the economic cost of the lockdowns, which have brought on a steep recession that we will probably spend years digging out of. This is why impatience to reopen is an entirely understandable sentiment, even if it is treated by much of the media as heretical. A balance obviously has to be struck. Much economic activity disappeared when people decided, on their own, to change their habits in response to the epidemic. Consumers won’t come back in full force until they believe the pathogen is under control. But we can’t stay locked down until the virus is entirely vanquished, or we will have destroyed the country to save it.On the other side of the ledger, the lockdowns have been too geographically sweeping. Not only are the states of our union vastly different, so are areas within states. There is no reason for rural areas of New York and Michigan, where many counties have a couple of dozen cases or fewer, to be subject to the same restrictions as New York City and Detroit. Likewise, statewide prohibitions on elective surgeries have, perversely, emptied hospital beds and idled medical workers in places that have had no COVID-19 surge. (The iconic Mayo Clinic has furloughed 30,000 staff members.) These procedures, often for serious illnesses such as cancer, need to resume.2. And so the initial, sporadic, minimal lockdown exits have begun. Bueno, we say, in addition to other things. More practically, we believe that our political system itself benefits strongly from the presumption of innocence. If the mere introduction of an accusation is sufficient to prompt a candidate’s withdrawal, the incentives for false charges will grow legion. Joe Biden is a hypocrite and an opportunist, but that is no reason to treat him any differently than we would treat anybody else. If he has truly changed his mind on this most important of questions, we welcome him into the fold. As Biden now argues, Tara Reade’s accusations should be “respectfully heard” and “rigorously vetted.” And, if the evidence does not rise to the level, the man at whom they are aimed should be assumed not guilty. But we will not get to that point with one side throwing a blanket over the story and muttering, “well, this time he’s one of We are of the same view today as we were in 2018, and as we were before that.

I don’t think it has much to do with the Attorney General’s duties under the Constitution.Finally, Rotner complains that Barr offered an interviewer his opinions about how lockdowns ought to proceed. He writes as though Barr intended these opinions as a guide to what his litigation strategy would be, even though Barr never said any such thing. Among the opinions to which Rotner objects is this one: “I think the president’s guidance has been, as I say, superb and very commonsensical, and I think a lot of the governors are following that.”In both expansive and vague. For starters, how are the lawyers at the Department of Justice supposed to reasonably calculate the national economic consequences of state and local ordinance? The answer, of course, is that they cannot. The only purpose of such a threat is to intimidate lawmakers into not adopting measures that might frustrate or delay Trump’s “open America again” policy.Next, Rotner objects to Barr’s having said that states could trigger intervention through “undue interference with the national economy.” Rotner calls that phrasingThird, this isn’t an argument against Barr’s view that the Department of Justice may have to go to federal court if states violate the Constitution — it’s an argument that he should be more willing to do that. It would be a bad thing if Alabama started quartering troops in people’s homes without their consent and Barr let it slide. That bad thing would not justify allowing cities in Mississippi to abridge religious freedom, too.Second, even assuming that abortion is on par with religious liberty as a constitutional right, there is a distinction between challenging a regulation singling out religious services and challenging a regulation that is merely being applied to abortion clinics.This complaint is unpersuasive for three reasons. First, the Constitution actually protects religious exercise — it’s right there in the text of the First Amendment — while the federal courts are just pretending that it protects abortion. The Attorney General is not, in my view, under any obligation to conduct litigation based on a view of the Constitution that he does not hold and that is incorrect. It is possible, of course, to take a contrary view, but one should not pretend that it is obviously true.Rotner argues that Barr’s concern about states’ restrictions on religious services is selective. “Religious liberty is not the only right protected by the Constitution.

No charge.<em>John Fund is a columnist for </em>Now many countries and U.S. states are beginning to follow Sweden’s lead. But California and other states continue to pile up isolation-induced health costs and blow gigantic holes in their budgets with lockdowns that, nationwide, have generated more than 30 million newly unemployed.Of course, Sweden paid a price during the pandemic. But whatever price the Swedes paid for their COVID-19 policy, they will tell you it was worth it. And it is easy to figure out that price. They never cratered their economy or blocked nonemergency surgeries. They had more deaths than their Nordic neighbors, but nothing even close to the 650 deaths per million the U.S. suffered during the 1968 Hong Kong flu, a pandemic that was handled with few social-isolation controls and no lockdowns.Sweden doesn’t have to worry about when and how to end social isolation. They don’t have to decide who to keep locked down and who to let out. They don’t have to get into civil-liberty arguments over involuntary restrictions or whether to fine people for not wearing masks and gloves.Unlike its Nordic neighbors and everywhere else, Sweden doesn’t have to worry about when to reintroduce its “vulnerable” isolated population to social mixing and risk their exposure to the virus. That has been already happening naturally and has generated a defensive reservoir of population viral resistance to COVID-19 that puts it — just like SARS, MERS, and the seasonal flu — in Sweden’s rearview mirror.<em><strong>Myth No. 3: Sweden’s relatively low number of intensive-care beds would spell disaster for its response to the virus.<br/>
</strong></em>So, on an age-adjusted basis, Sweden has done significantly better than the U.S. in terms of both cases per million and deaths per million — and with no lockdowns.It is ironic that half of the Swedish deaths are in people over the age of 86. Life expectancy in Sweden is 83, whereas it’s 79 in the U.S., so it isn’t surprising that there are relatively more frail elderly in Sweden. Out of every 100,000 births, about 10,000 more Swedes are still alive at age 85 than Americans are, so Sweden’s slightly higher COVID-19 death rate, compared with ours, mostly reflects the fact that a larger percentage of Swedes live well past 79.As elsewhere, Swedish COVID-19 deaths are overwhelmingly among the frail elderly and those with serious chronic disease. Over half of Swedish deaths are in nursing homes. Of those who died, 90 percent were over 70 and half were over 86, with just 1 percent younger than 50.Tegnell admits that his country failed to contain the initial outbreak in crowded senior homes. “Something like 50 percent of our death toll comes from the rather small population living in care homes,” he said. “We know that we have had a problem with the elderly homes, this has been a discussion for years.”Sweden has 265 reported COVID-19 <em><strong>Myth No. 2: Sweden did much worse than the U.S. or other countries in managing COVID-19 cases and deaths.<br/>
</strong></em>Jan Albert, a professor in the Department of Microbiology, Tumor, and Cell Biology at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, told CNN that strict lockdowns “only serve to flatten the curve, and flattening the curve doesn’t mean that cases disappear — they are just moved in time.” He added: “And as long as the health-care system reasonably can cope with and give good care to the ones that need care, it’s not clear that having the cases later in time is better.”We look at other consequences for public health, like closing schools. That causes enormous problems, not least for the health of the children. I mean, children that already are disadvantaged, if you close down the schools, this is the one good thing they have sometimes in life. This is where they get their food. This is where they get their social context. So closing schools is not a good thing.Tegnell and his colleagues recognized that the decision to shut down a country was not solely a medical decision based only on the virus The economic costs and health impacts caused by lockdowns are enormous, they realized, so they factored into their analysis the broader societal effects of any restrictions. The saw, for instance, that there is no evidence that children easily transmit the virus. Tegnell told NPR:<strong><em>Myth No. 1: Sweden’s policy was not carefully thought out or well considered.</em><br/>
</strong>Well, a month later we now know more.As A fortunate constellation of circumstances ensured that Dr. Anders Tegnell, the chief epidemiologist of Sweden, was in charge of that country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the misgivings of many Swedish politicians and foreign observers. Tegnell heroically bucked the conventional wisdom of every other nation and carefully examined the insubstantial evidence that social-isolation controls would help reduce COVID-19 deaths over the full course of the virus.
A month ago, we first wrote about The Swedish ambassador to the U.S., Karin Ulrika Olofsdotter, says: “Dr. Mike Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization’s Emergencies Program, says: “I think if we are to reach a new normal, I think in many ways Sweden represents a future model — if we wish to get back to a society in which we don’t have lockdowns.”With a death rate significantly lower than that of France, Spain, the U.K., Belgium, Italy, and other European Union countries, Swedes can enjoy the spring without panic or fears of reigniting a new epidemic as they go about their day in a largely normal fashion.<span class=""drop"">S</span>

We are all sinners, but a society that values goodness and decency would be one that flushes so many poisons out of our system. Now we need a reboot. We probably can’t expect it from politics and those with the loudest microphones, but we can demand it by the choices we make and the conversations we engage and the way we live our lives. May all these virtual encounters with faith and “thoughts and prayers” bear real fruit. As we reopen, let it be a What this coronavirus time should be reminding us is that we are all equally vulnerable. Yes, maybe some of us are more vulnerable than others to COVID-19, but it will be something — we are all mortal beings with an unknown end date. While some know death is coming sooner rather than later. Are we ready? Can virtue be seen in our lives? Do we treat people with respect and defend life? I think we have to do both. Don’t we want to do both? Will this time draw us together, instead of more violently apart, to do what we have been saying we’ve been doing — loving our neighbor, protecting the vulnerable innocent? Let’s do it for real — whether it be the noble service of politics or the gift of family or community or any human life.Both Donald Trump and Joe Biden talk about Christianity. Joe Biden professes, of course, to be Catholic, despite his position on abortion, the killing of the innocent unborn. Donald Trump said at the March for Life this January that everyone is made in the image and likeness of God. Even those he tweets about? Even those in the media? Even Nancy Pelosi and “Sleepy Joe”? These are not moral equivalents, to be sure, but how do we look to our fellow man, really? This has an impact on how policy affects the human person.
During that Mass, Cardinal Dolan preached about the Gospel reading for the day, about the road to Emmaus. That’s the road Christians are meant to be on always. Walking with Jesus, recognizing God present in His creations, even when we can’t be present for His Presence in the sacraments of the Church.That Sunday Mass at St. Patrick’s, with so many people tuned in, gives me some hope. Hope that seeds are being planted. You’ve got to wonder when a few days later the president is back behaving badly on Twitter, though. But God can work in delayed reflections, too. And miracles can happen. A tweet even from a president isn’t the biggest thing in the world, needless to say, but we desperately need of some change of tone with respect to virtue.I normally work overtime to not let life or even a column revolve around tweets, especially presidential ones, but I think that those two offer a critical chance for national reflection. We’ve had our lives upended in many ways these past weeks and months now. And that includes Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Coronavirus has become the priority. Even if we are trying to live as normally as possible, the kids not being in school, the work meetings via Zoom calls, the masks we wear in a world of too many figurative masks anyway, expose the reality. Many of us know that things won’t be the same as before even as we are beginning to reemerge in various places from quarantine. And yet, whatever the truth are to allegations, you get the sense, too, that the same-old is just about to rear its head again — we are going to fall into the same old politics, which, even when it had some good as its end, seemed to bring out the worst in so many of us.The Biden interview came a few days after a post-midnight tweet from the president ridiculing a number of media personalities in cruel ways, including the cohost and spouse interviewing Biden that morning. And before that tweet was another from the president announcing that he would be attending Mass virtually at St. Patrick’s Cathedral the next morning, on Sunday. The cardinal celebrating Mass acknowledged the president, which predictably incited some anger. The comments on YouTube during Mass brought out some of the typical politics in people, but as I saw more than 20,000 people watching, I couldn’t help but pray that miracles were happening. Perhaps a late-night presidential tweet led to little seeds of encounter with God, even through a screen, and brought people closer to Mass than most had experienced in the month of April.<span class=""drop"">W</span>

At the same time, the panel warned that the “breadth of the ban on religious services, together with a haven for numerous secular exceptions, should give pause to anyone who prizes religious freedom.”The panel also found that the governor’s orders likely violate the church’s Free Exercise protections of the federal Constitution. The orders have “several potential hallmarks of discrimination” that deprive them of the deference that generally applicable laws receive. For example, “many of the serial exceptions for secular activities pose comparable public health risks to worship services,” yet the governor “has offered no good reason so far for refusing to trust the congregants who promise to use care in worship in just the same way it trusts accountants, lawyers, and laundromat workers to do the same.”As for Kentucky’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, “[t]he way the orders treat comparable religious and non-religious activities suggests that they do not amount to the least restrictive way of regulating the churches.” “How,” the panel asks, “are in-person meetings with social distancing” (which the orders allow in “typical office environments”) “any different from drive-in church services with social distancing?” And how can the orders “permit big-lot parking for secular purposes [but] not for religious purposes”?In a “While the law may take periodic naps during a pandemic, we will not let it sleep through one.” So declared a Sixth Circuit panel in a ruling on Saturday (in National ReviewFollow Us",0,Sixth Circuit Injunction Against Kentucky Ban on Drive-In Religious Services

In the unlikely event it does not, the church, as supported by the Justice Department, should prevail if it appeals to the Fourth Circuit. Hopefully things will not get that far. Governor Northam should back down. And state and municipal executives should stop thinking of the Constitution as above their pay grade — when they think about it at all.The Virginia restrictions run afoul of the First Amendment. Likely, that is why the state has not tried to defend them in court. Moreover, the Justice Department points out that the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Saturday granted an injunction against similarly capricious restrictions that Democratic   
     
   Obviously, Northam’s rules impose selective burdens on religious exercise. The Justice Department is not saying that a state could never ban gatherings of more than ten people. Nor is it saying that courts should second-guess the wisdom of policies put in place by political officials accountable to the people who elected them. It is simply saying that the Constitution forbids a state from subjecting religion to more burdensome restrictions than it imposes on other activities.Nevertheless, The Justice Department acknowledges that, in its 1905 By contrast, Northam permits the operation of non-retail businesses offering professional services. A law or accounting firm, for example, faces no restrictions on conference room meetings at which people may be crowded together considerably closer than they are in the church. Virginia also permits the operation of retail businesses (e.g., liquor stores, building-supply retailers, dry cleaners), at which customers pass each other and transact business at close quarters.In the Virginia case, 
While no one questions that the state has a compelling interest in preventing the spread of infectious disease, its restrictions on fundamental rights, such as communal worship, must be the least restrictive means practically available. The state must pursue its legitimate public-safety goal while remaining solicitous of the rights that governments are created to protect. If the state social-distancing restrictions are capricious or discriminatory, in their letter or in the way they are enforced, they are unconstitutional. That is, if the state is permitting social interaction for commercial or other purposes, but denying similar social interaction in religious exercise, it is perforce not using the least restrictive means to regulate First Amendment-protected activity.The U.S. attorney general has countered that federal constitutional law is dispositive on this subject. Consequently, it is not the burden of Americans to prove that the exercise of their fundamental rights is “essential”; the burden is on the state to demonstrate that the right in question cannot be exercised safely under any conditions less severe than those the state is imposing.We need not speculate whether insufficient weight has been accorded the Constitution in the fashioning of various prohibitions on worship, work, and assembly. As New Jersey A number of governors and mayors, particularly in blue states and cities, have decreed that, in their considered opinion, religious observance is not sufficiently “essential” to be indulged while the authorities are trying to stop the spread of COVID-19, the potentially lethal infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

It is precisely at difficult times such as these that cool heads and a light touch are needed — and those have been lacking in too many states and cities. There is a difference between social distancing and house arrest, and Governor Newsom owes it to his constituents to stay on the right side of that line.We also believe with the National Recreation and Park Association that parks and other outdoor spaces can be used safely and responsibly. As NRPA puts it: “We believe that many parks, trails and open spaces can continue to be used in a safe manner that allows people to enjoy the mental and physical health benefits these spaces provide. In all instances, we recommend people follow local, state and national ordinances and guidelines regarding the use of these spaces and recognize that these vary from community to community.” In big, diverse states such as California and Texas, it is far more sensible to push these decisions to the municipal level to the extent that doing so is possible. There is every reason to believe that the authorities in Orange County are competent to see to the health and hygiene policies of Orange County and its public places.We very strongly suspect that having figures such as Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot bellowing at teenagers, “We will take you to jail — period” probably does more harm than good. The hectoring and bullying style that has too often accompanied the implementation of social distancing inspires more defiance than the rules themselves do. And such threats bring with them an obvious problem: Make good on them and you are endangering lives with the enforced closeness of arrest and jail; fail to make good on them and the credibility of local government is eroded. Best not to put yourself into such a bind to begin with. There will be some noncompliance, but a domineering approach is likely to make that problem worse rather than better.
We would like to see scrupulous compliance with social-distancing practices. We also believe that people are more likely to accept the legitimacy of those rules when the decisions governing them are made in a way that is reasonable and democratic rather than unreasoning and autocratic, when decisions are made at the local level and respect the genuine diversity among our communities, and when those entrusted with the extraordinary authority of emergency powers are not themselves acting out of hysteria or in response to hysteria.Orange County is, in reality, faring better than much of California in the epidemic: As of this writing, it has suffered 52 COVID-19 deaths out of a population of more than 3 million, substantially fewer than nearby counties such as Riverside and San Bernardino, even though those have smaller populations.

No charge.As I The findings here are broadly similar; the results for case growth are strong, and while these authors do find a result for deaths, they concede it’s “imprecisely estimated.” And the addition that places with high population density benefit more from shutdowns is important.This study explores the impact of SIPOs [shelter-in-place orders] on health, with particular attention to heterogeneity in their impacts. First, using daily state-level social distancing data from SafeGraph . . . we document that adoption of a SIPO was associated with a 5 to 10 percent increase in the rate at which state residents remained in their homes full-time. Then, using daily state-level coronavirus case data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we find that approximately three weeks following the adoption of a SIPO, cumulative COVID-19 cases fell by 44 percent. Event-study analyses confirm common COVID-19 case trends in the week prior to SIPO adoption and show that SIPO-induced case reductions grew larger over time. However, this average effect masks important heterogeneity across states — early adopters and high population density states appear to reap larger benefits from their SIPOs. Finally, we find that statewide SIPOs were associated with a reduction in coronavirus-related deaths, but estimated mortality effects were imprecisely estimated.On to the This paper For U.S. states, the paper focuses on stay-at-home orders, so it doesn’t distinguish among the various specific restrictions they entail. Once again, the results are strong for case growth — “a state’s own policy was associated with a reduction of the growth rate of 16.9 log points [i.e., in the ballpark of 17 percent]” — but not deaths. The paper further finds “spillover” effects among states, where a state’s own trends depend, in large part, on what other states are doing.Note, however, that this measures confirmed cases, which depend heavily on testing. The results for deaths are generally not statistically significant, perhaps because of “our short sample and long lags between implementation . . . and effects on death rate.”The policies most strongly and statistically significantly associated with slowing the [daily] growth rate of . . . confirmed cases in order of magnitude of impact were public transport closures (-0.09 . . .), enforced workplace closures (-0.0784 . . .), limited domestic travel ([-0.065] . . .), and restrictions on international travel (-0.0639 . . .). School closures . . . and limits on public events . . . are negatively related to growth rates of confirmed cases but were not found to be statistically significant.Here are the main results; in reading the following, note that the numbers can be roughly interpreted as percentages (e.g., 0.05 would correspond to about 5 percent):<a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w27099.pdf"">The first paper</a>Both came out today via the National Bureau of Economic Research, and they’re available National ReviewFollow Us",0,Two New Lockdown Studies

Not only do abortion providers — who claim to be offering health care to women — apparently believe that they ought to be exempted from the regulations applied to health-care professionals, but they also appear willing to risk contributing to the spread of a potentially fatal disease simply to continue profiting from abortions.The previous week, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld the Arkansas policy that included elective abortions among the non-essential procedures that the state limited during the COVID-19 response in order to prevent the spread of disease and conserve medical equipment.“Delaying abortion care across the board for a COVID-19 test is especially unwarranted in view of Arkansas’s otherwise permissive approach to letting individuals mix and mingle in restaurants and gyms without negative COVID tests,” the lawsuit states. It also notes that “women who cannot obtain access” to a COVID-19 test are “entirely barred . . . from exercising their constitutional right to receive pre-viability abortion care in Arkansas.”The latest effort from abortion providers to stop states from restricting abortion during the COVID-19 outbreak is an especially troubling one: In Arkansas, the American Civil Liberties Union and the state’s lone abortion clinic have sued to block a policy that would require women to obtain a negative coronavirus test before getting an abortion.National ReviewFollow Us",0,ACLU Sues to Stop Arkansas from Requiring COVID-19 Tests before Abortion Procedures

To quantify it, we would have to weight deaths by age, but what would be the formula? Should there be a single bright line, such as age 80? The death of someone older than that would count as equal to three-fifths the death of someone younger? Whatever formula we came up with would, I hope, provoke strong moral objections, including some from me. If we’re going to imply that you should interpret fatality figures on an “age-adjusted basis,” we need to spell out what we mean, and we need to be specific.In Sweden as elsewhere, COVID-19 is most fatal to the elderly. Pointing out that Swedes (average lifespan, 83 years) live longer on average than Americans do (79) and that more than half of Sweden’s COVID-19 fatalities have been in nursing homes, Fund and Hay imply that in Sweden the population that has died from the virus is on average a little older than in the United States. They may be right about that, although they don’t produce the statistics that would enable us to make the comparison. “On an age-adjusted basis,” they write, “Sweden has done significantly better than the U.S” when we measure “deaths per million.”Arguments for lifting any given lockdown can be made. At this point in the pandemic, however, Sweden’s experience no longer clearly supports them. Granted, the landscape may look different a year from now. We’re still trying to see through the fog. Fund and Hay tout Sweden’s relatively low number of COVID-19 cases per capita, but that figure alone isn’t meaningful unless we know how many Swedes have been tested. In any case, if Swedish policymakers are aiming for herd immunity, they should want the infection rate to be higher, not lower. Twelve percent of Swedes who have tested positive have died. That figure is high — in the United States, for example, the percentage is 7 — and so perhaps Sweden is overcounting deaths related to COVID-19. But perhaps not. We don’t know.The United States should learn from Sweden’s response to the pandemic, Sweden ranks seventh on the list of countries with most COVID-19 fatalities per capita. (I exclude microstates with populations under 100,000.) The six countries with more fatalities per capita are all in Western Europe. (I include the United Kingdom.) The fatality rate in the Netherlands is only slightly higher than in Sweden, but since April 1 it’s grown faster in the latter. Sweden appears to be on track to move up from seventh to sixth place before long.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Sweden’s COVID-19 Fatality Rate Is High

But whether that trade-off turns out to have been wise will depend on what treatments and vaccines we eventually have, and when we have them.Second: The perspective Fund and Hay take on the mortality rate is open to question. They say the rate is higher than that of the U.S. only because it has an older population. But that seems less like a defense of Sweden’s policy than a reason for it to have hesitated to adopt that policy.He told a news conference that many restaurants, hotels and bars were struggling – with a 50% average drop in demand.

No charge.The answer is <strong>ADDENDUM</strong>By early April, it became clear that the Russian government, with its far-reaching surveillance, top-of-the-line propaganda, and extensive authoritarian powers . . . was in about as much trouble as our free societies. “We can gripe about how the U.S. government has responded to this virus, but not many countries have handled this particularly well. The European countries have had way more deaths per capita. Back on March 21, CNN reported, with way too much credulity, “<strong>Hey, Remember When Russia Was Supposed to Be a Coronavirus Success Story?</strong>A .37 percent fatality rate, applied over 150 million Americans, calculates out to 555,000 fatalities.The University of Bonn researchers studied the outbreak in the region of Heinsberg and calculated Here’s a simple but dark way of looking at it: We have 250 million adults in the United States. Some medical experts think we can achieve herd immunity with as little as 60 percent having the virus, some think it’s more like 82 percent. If we only need 60 percent of Americans to catch it to achieve herd immunity, we’re talking about 150 million American adults. One-tenth of one percent of that sum is 150,000 people. For every tenth of a percentage point in the fatality rate, count 150,000 dead Americans.I frequently hear people insisting that the most-frequently cited death rate figures for the virus are useless, because we don’t know how many people have the virus and are asymptomatic. (We’re probably undercounting the deaths, too; Medically, the best possible response to the virus might be to keep Americans in their houses and apartments for months upon months. But that’s just not physically, economically, socially, or psychologically possible.With parts of the country gradually and partially reopening, we should expect the virus to spread at least a little further and a little faster. As the numbers get worse in the coming weeks, you’re going to hear a lot of people who oppose reopening insisting that various states are being reckless and those who are demanding an end to the full lockdown are being selfish. As I’ve tried to emphasize over the past few weeks, most Americans wanted to help protect others from the virus, and they’ve been willing to pay a terrible price, mostly economically, to do so. They also delayed their own medical treatment for non-life-threatening conditions, This doesn’t mean social distancing and all of our other measures are useless. But it appears that between America’s essential workers, people going to the supermarket and picking up take-out food, going to the pharmacy or needed medical treatments, and other necessary violations of the social distancing ideal — It’s worth noting that our number of cases has steadily increased, even with almost all of the country in various states of quarantine and lockdown over the past seven, now going on eight weeks. Gottleib noted, “while mitigation didn’t fail, I think it’s fair to say that it didn’t work as well as we expected. We expected that we would start seeing more significant declines in new cases and deaths around the nation at this point. And we’re just not seeing that.”SCOTT GOTTLIEB: — those thirty thousand cases are really three hundred thousand cases.MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think when you look out to the end of June, it’s probably the case that we’re going to get above a hundred thousand deaths nationally. I think the concerning thing here is that we’re looking at the prospect that this may be a persistent spread, that while the doubling time has come down dramatically to about twenty-five days. So, the amount of days it takes for the epidemic to double in size is about twenty-five now, from day– days or less than a week at the outset of this epidemic. We may be facing the prospect that twenty thousand, thirty thousand new cases a day diagnosed becomes a new normal and a thousand or more deaths becomes a new normal as well. Right now, we’re seeing, for about thirty days now, about thirty thousand cases a day and two thousand deaths a day. And if you factor in that we’re probably diagnosing only one in ten infections —On As of this writing, we’re almost at 70,000 deaths; it will probably surpass that threshold by the time you read this. We’re going to hit 80,000 deaths sometime in the next few days if we’re unlucky and next week if we’re lucky. If you don’t like a particular model or doubt its assumptions, fine. It shouldn’t really alter the broad conclusion: This is a really bad public-health crisis, and even if Those 200,000-cases-per-day and 3,000 deaths-per-day sound like a lot more than where we are now, but it isn’t The big story this morning is a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, used in a draft government report, that projects the United States will have 200,000 cases of coronavirus infection per day by June 1, “a staggering jump that would be accompanied by more than 3,000 deaths each day.” <strong>The Death Projections Are Not Promising</strong>Happy Cinco de Mayo. When this thing is all over, we need to have a two-week festival of all the holidays we’ve been forced to celebrate under limited circumstances. On the menu today: some blunt talk about death projections, why even fatality rates that seem really low will still add up to many deaths before herd immunity is reached, and why the American media shouldn’t trust Russian boasts on the coronavirus or any other topic.National ReviewFollow Us",0,"Whichever Model You Use, This Virus Is Going to Kill a Lot of People"

The truth is that, because of the generosity of unemployment benefits, many firms will have a hard time retaining their employees and will end up having to repay their PPP loans. No solution can help businesses if the economy stays on ice for many months longer. But this is a good start and less chaotic solution.It is the perfect time to plug Arnold Kling’s idea, which Apparently, the second round of PPP funds already is We construct a new measure of geographic exposure of regions to banks that over or underperformed in terms of PPP allocation relative to their share of small business lending. States with higher exposure to banks that performed well in terms of bank PPP exposure also saw higher levels of PPP lending.Lender heterogeneity in PPP participation appears to be one reason why we find a weak correlation between economic declines and PPP lending. We find significant heterogeneity across banks in terms of disbursing PPP funds, which does not only reflect differences in underlying loan demand. For example, because of an asset cap restriction in place since 2018, Wells Fargo disbursed a significantly smaller portion of PPP loans relative to their market share of small business loans. . . .But the data highlight the role played by the banks in the less than desirable distribution of funds:I assume that this has to do with the way the program was designed and the fact that every firm tried to apply, whether they needed it at the time or not, out of fear that the funds would run out when they actually needed it. Bigger and better organized firms probably had a leg up, since many banks would only lend at first to firms they were already doing business with.PPP loans were disproportionately allocated to areas least affected by the crisis: fifteen percent of establishments in the regions most affected by declines in hours worked and business shutdowns received PPP funding; in contrast, thirty percent of all establishments received PPP funding in the least affected regions.And:We find no evidence that funds flowed to areas that were more adversely affected by the economic effects of the pandemic, as measured by declines in hours worked or business shutdowns. If anything, we find some suggestive evidence that funds flowed to areas less hard hit.A central goal of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was the prevention of mass layoffs and firm bankruptcies though the injection of liquidity to companies affected.

					© 2020 National Review				Our Capital Letter email newsletter delivers a weekly digest on finance, business, and economics from an NR sensibility.Fears of a zombie apocalypse may not come to fruition. If the coronavirus shock ends in the next few months, the Fed might succeed in quickly unwinding its balance sheet, and the Fed’s corporate-lending facilities remain limited in scope and scale; the riskiest businesses will still have to tap private markets to stay alive. But a protracted economic shock could put more capital in the hands of weak businesses, especially if Powell expands the new lending facilities to include more junk-rated companies. Policymakers must strike a balance between staving off a deep recession and permanently hindering economic competition.In a functioning market, Boeing would pay a hefty premium for loans. A global halt in travel, coupled with the costly 737 Max debacle, has severely weakened its operations. If enough Boeings obtain capital at below-market rates, we could see a zombie apocalypse in the U.S. corporate sector. In such a scenario, inefficient businesses surviving on life support would put a drag on GDP growth for years to come. As Hoshi and Kashyap outline, zombies raise the cost of capital for productive firms, decreasing innovation and reducing economic growth. They also depress prices by fueling overproduction, and drive up wages as central-bank largesse subsidizes labor costs.Now, in response to the coronavirus, the Fed has followed Japan’s lead. By backing corporate-credit markets, the Fed incentivized investors to capitalize companies suffering from the global economic collapse. Boeing, which had negotiated a $60 billion congressional rescue package in March, ended up raising $25 billion from the private markets and withdrawing its request for government assistance. Seeing that they could simply unload bonds to the Fed if the economic outlook soured, investors lined up to provide capital to Boeing and other companies that were facing default just weeks ago.This financial collapse impaired the collateral held by Japanese banks, corporations, and households, threatening the foundation of the country’s economy. Though the bursting of the bubble represented a return to reasonable valuations, Japanese authorities had their hands tied: If they didn’t intervene to bolster the financial system, economic catastrophe would follow. They thus pushed banks to roll-over nonperforming loans in order to fend off “public criticism that banks were worsening the recession by denying credit to needy corporations,” as Takeo Hoshi and Anil Kashyap explained in a 
The “zombie” phenomenon emerged after the 1992 Japanese financial crisis. In the 1980s, Japan appeared poised to overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest economy. So rapid was the rise of its high-tech manufacturing sector that economists called it the “Japanese miracle.” Thinking the country’s sky-high growth rates would last forever, investors piled in Japanese assets, prodded by Japan’s state-managed banking system. In the early ’90s, the house of cards came crashing down: Stocks fell by 60 percent, with real estate suffering similar losses.But Powell’s actions come with downside. Lending to corporations could lead to the emergence of “zombie” firms — inefficient companies relying on cheap credit as life support. The Fed’s lending facilities allow some risky firms to fund their operations even if they’re losing money. That’s bad news for the economy, because zombies eat up capital and workers that should go to better businesses.The Fed’s programs staved off a severe collapse, and turned the shortest bear market in history into a rally. Buffett praised Fed chair Jay Powell on Saturday for his forceful action, ranking him alongside Paul Volcker as one of the best central-bank helmsmen in modern history.But during the massive sell-off in March, Buffett sat on the sideline. While investors waited for the familiar headline announcing a blockbuster Berkshire Hathaway deal, the investment firm sold more stock than it purchased, building up $137 billion in cash. Berkshire’s inactivity is a result of the Federal Reserve’s emergency-lending programs, which propped up asset markets and precluded the kind of undervaluation that Buffett seeks out. “There was a period right before the Fed acted” when companies asked Buffett for capital, he said, but “after the Fed acted, a number of them were able to get money in the public market frankly at terms we wouldn’t have given.”<span class=""drop"">W</span>

While many who catch SARS-CoV-2 will recover, they will still be counted in the case total; “cases” and “active cases” are different measurements. “Total number of cases” is always going to go up until there’s a vaccine or herd immunity, and then it will level off.

In the meantime, it’s time for our elected officials to recognize that Americans are going out into the world again, and that they will perish for lack of good information about how to do so safely.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>What do public-health experts think of the growing intuition that it doesn’t spread well outside, which is driving people back to the beach? How long does it survive on soft and hard surfaces, really? Should the especially nervous cease disinfecting cardboard boxes delivered to their houses? What about the chilling anecdotes about church choirs and singing congregations? Could churches dramatically curtail risk by going instrumental, or by having virus-negative soloists rather than choirs or congregations do the singing? Can people easily spread the virus while sitting together, but not closely, on a patio or deck? Can larger groups of people who trust each other begin congregating if they follow social-distancing guidelines? Can kids playing with plastic or rubber toys transmit the virus to each other?If the government wants to help, its public-health experts need to be appraising us of what’s actually risky and what’s not, where we can mitigate chances of infection and where we cannot. We could surely use regular, scrupulously transparent updates on the development of the scientific community’s thinking about the virus and how to respond to it.In an ideal world, Americans would be going out confident in the knowledge that infections had declined significantly and a fully operating test-and-trace regime was in place to warn the exposed and quarantine the ill. As it is, neither of those things is true, and state and federal leaders still probably can’t keep the majority of Americans inside much longer. Only fear can do that. A big spike in infections and death may push people back inside despite their desperate desire to get back to normal. But the key words there are “desperate desire”: After being told they had to dramatically reorder their lives to save our health-care system, Americans who see that system surviving the initial surge of COVID-19 cases are more than ready to go out and see each other again.Data from Apple suggest that in Georgia, 60 percent more people were back on the roads this weekend than had been in mid April. California still has non-essential businesses shut, but the cell-phone data show people are still coming out in hard-hit areas of the state. Even in New York, a rainy and miserable April gave way to inviting May sunshine, and people are beginning to go out more.The American people led the charge on social distancing and locking down before the government acted. All the data show as much: Commutes, air travel, shopping, and restaurant reservations all began to show dramatic declines in late February, before stay-at-home orders became part of our collective vocabulary. Now, the self-governing American people are leading themselves out, guidelines from the White House and instructions from state governments be damned.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

No charge.As the pandemic abates, the U.S. and our allies should clearly and openly call out the abuses that China has perpetrated on the Western world since its admission to the WTO. The mantra of accommodation to China to mollify the PRC and slowly integrate them into existing global trade relationships has failed — or, more precisely, has worked for China but no one else. China’s leaders are repressive, they violate trade norms, and they steal intellectual property. They project hegemonic power wherever they can. We need to develop a partnership with American, European, and Asian businesses and governments to bring China’s exploitation to an end.How can American business and government oppose China’s outsized influence? One way is to create new supply chains and reinforce existing ones with U.S. allies in Asia, and in the Western Hemisphere and Europe. Chinese leaders do not think that our leaders and businesses have the resolve to accept higher costs in a less efficient supply chain for imported products, and we need to call their bluff. Policymakers should create new incentives for businesses to reorient supply chains away from China and disincentives for companies to invest there. A “sovereignty tax” on American investment in China, reflecting the value that U.S. companies derive from U.S. sovereignty but the damage they are doing to our strategic position by investing there, could be an example. It is worth incurring higher costs to be strategically secure.
Since China’s addition to the WTO, it has been carefully but fully abusive toward American companies and businesses. The Institute for Supply Management estimates that three-quarters of American companies report supply-chain disruptions in China. Their manipulation goes beyond supply-chains. When Marriott and Delta posted maps showing Taiwan as an independent country, China objected and demanded that they remove these maps from their websites. Sadly, both companies buckled to authoritarian China and changed their maps. As Lenin said, “the capitalists will sell us the ropes we will hang them with.”China’s scope of power goes beyond its domination of the production of everyday medications. Its exploitation of intellectual property led me to introduce the SHEET Act to prevent countries such as China from stealing technology and intelligence from educational foreign-exchange programs, a method which illustrates the Communist country’s desire to steal and misuse intellectual property from the U.S.While the world suffers from health and financial challenges, China has touted its ability to take advantage of the American economy and our weakness in trade. China controls many critical products and components of America’s supply chains. Of U.S. imports, China In early December, China knew an infectious virus had been discovered in Wuhan. It was not until December 31 that China reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) that there was a risk of human-to-human transmission of the virus. The WHO failed the world by not publishing this. However, our intelligence services briefed the president on January 3, and eleven times after that throughout January and February about the magnitude of the coronavirus threat. Nothing happened.<span class=""drop"">W</span>

It is worth noting that a large percentage of the over-40 population has one of these conditions, and so it will be essential to monitor COVID-19 cases over time for evidence that helps us narrow the categories of risk, and also evidence regarding the relationship between positive antibody tests and immunity.If you’re wondering about whom the plan means when they say “at-risk individuals” . . .Similarly, we should reopen workplaces to healthy, non-elderly individuals who don’t live with vulnerable people. At-risk individuals with jobs should continue to have opportunities to work from home or to receive paid medical leave.(Keep in mind, Children who live with the elderly or other at-risk individuals should continue to stay home. Teachers and staff from vulnerable populations should stay home as well, with paid leave. School districts should immediately begin to develop virtual lesson plans for those who must remain home.To start, states and localities should work as quickly as possible to reopen pre-K and K-12 schools. Children have a very low risk of falling seriously ill due to Covid-19, and the majority can and should return to school this academic year. Switzerland, for example, is planning to reopen schools on May 11, based on research showing that school closures were among the least effective measures at reducing European Covid-19 cases.You should read the whole thing — I’m not going to lie to you. This plan stinks. It just happens to stink less than all of the other options. The Avik Roy plan assumes we can’t create a vaccine in the coming year, we can’t test everyone as often as we would like, and that we won’t get a miraculous treatment that mitigates the danger of the virus.With no enthusiasm, I contend that the United States is going to have to enact some version of the He’s not crazy — or at least not on this particular point.<strong>Emanuel</strong><strong>Bazelon</strong>By the way, as much as I enjoy reminding Ezekiel of his terribly wrong early assessments, he’s also willing to tell the <strong>Reopening Society with Manageable, but Still Existent, Risk</strong>I can’t begrudge someone for recoiling from the thought that more than 71,000 Americans have succumbed to the virus. But that doesn’t mean that a smaller number must be the more accurate one, In reading the debates about the virus and how to handle the ongoing outbreak, you get the sense that some people placed bets early on and are determined to see those early assessments turn out right. Some people insist that because the In January, we saw many inaccurate reassurances that Americans should be more worried about the common flu than this new virus that emerged in Wuhan, China. Back on January 30, former Obama White House health advisor Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel told CNBC: “One of the recurring points in discussing this virus over the past — <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2007/03/08/7458809/embrace-the-suck-and-more-military-speak"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">“Embrace the suck” is a military slang term</a><strong>In Order to Get Through This, We Need to Be Able to Handle Bad News</strong><a href=""https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2020-04-29-arthritis-drug-presents-promise-as-treatment-for-covid-19-pneumonia.aspx"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Tocilizumab is another immunosuppressant drug that is being used in trials to treat the coronavirus.</a>From this, you can get a sense of how and why hydroxychloroquine might be effective in some circumstances and not others. If the patient’s immune system is strong enough to fight off the coronavirus, but is at risk of going into overdrive and setting off a cytotkine storm, administering the right amount of hydroxychloroquine might put their immune system back in the Goldilocks zone — strong enough to fight off and defeat the virus, but not so strong that it starts attacking vital organs by mistake. It’s also easy to see why we would only want people taking this drug under a doctor’s recommendation and possibly supervision — take the drug too early, and you suppress the body’s immune system just when it needs that system functioning well to fight off the invading virus. Take the drug too late, and the damage to the vital organs can’t be overcome.The coronavirus identified as SARS-CoV-2 can generate a “cytokine storm” — when the body’s immune system kicks into overdrive and starts attacking healthy cells in important organs. Dr. Randy Cron, an expert on cytokine storms at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, People might wonder why anyone would want to take a drug that weakens their immune system. Hydroxychloroquine can be an effective drug for lupus, because with lupus, the body’s immune system becomes overactive and starts attacking healthy, normal cells. It is also used to treat arthritis, because in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, their immune system attacks the lining of their joints. With Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine actually slow down parts of a patient’s immune system by “interfere with lysosomal activity and autophagy, interact with membrane stability and alter signalling pathways and transcriptional activity, which can result in inhibition of cytokine production and modulation of certain co-stimulatory molecules” — whichPart of the frustration in dealing with a really bad situation is a ravenous hunger for magic bullet solutions. One reader wrote in, contending that hydroxychloroquine is effective 100 percent of the time if it’s administered early enough, so why not reopen society and give everyone a prescription for hydroxychloroquine at the first sign of the virus?<strong>We Need to Stop Expecting a Miracle Pill</strong>A lot to chew over today: why the drug hydroxychloroquine will prove to be a life-saver for some coronavirus patients and useless or even a life-ender for others; why the country needs to “embrace the suck” and be able to accept, process, and respond to bad news; why we are likely to be forced into a reopening plan that lots of Americans will vehemently dislike; and the 2020 campaign’s forgotten man.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Why Hydroxychloroquine Didn’t Turn Out to Be a Miracle Pill

No charge.We have been warned.“Hoarding cash may be inconvenient and risky,” wrote Rogoff in a related paper, “but if rates become too negative, it becomes worth it.” He would clearly prefer to see that emergency exit locked and the key thrown away, leaving savers helpless in the face of whatever central bankers (and not only central bankers) might dream up.Indeed, they will: To its credit, the central bank of Switzerland, one of the countries now burdened with negative interest rates, has made it clear that it has no plans to junk its thousand-franc bills. It accepts that these are used as a store of value, something that Rogoff, no friend of the saver, might regard as reprehensible but the sensible Swiss do not….Before dismissing this as a form of madness that only Europeans could embrace, check out what Harvard’s Kenneth Rogoff has been saying. Writing in the In a speech last September, Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England’s chief economist, grumbled about the “constraint physical currency imposes” on setting negative interest rates. After considering various ways of dealing with this nuisance, he concluded that an “interesting solution” would be to “maintain the principle of a government-backed currency, but have it issued in an electronic rather than paper form.” This “would allow negative interest rates to be levied on currency easily and speedily.” Translation: Make people hold their cash in electronic form (and thus in banks); they will then have no means of escaping the levy on savings that negative interest rates effectively represent.Or The Fed has reduced rates to zero, and there are strong lobbies seeking to push them below zero, as in Europe and Japan. The main protection against this is the ability to hold cash, which at least offers a safe zero return. That is why Keynesians are trying to move us to an all-electronic payments system, in which the cash alternative would no longer be available . . . Should cash be eliminated, there would be nothing to stop “stimulators” from pushing interest rates to negative 5 percent, wiping out small savings and making speculative real-estate and private-equity investments hugely profitable. That would be inflationary — further damaging savers.Well, one thing, which Hutchinson sets out in his article, is this:What could possibly go wrong?If central banks around the world created digital currencies, each person could have a segregated account. This idea is gathering steam. US Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown initially sought to include digital banking as part of the coronavirus response. He wants the US Federal Reserve to create digital dollar accounts and wallets for all citizens. If that happened, all banking would happen through a digital backbone and wallet. ATMs and bank branches, which are already closing at a rapid rate, would become obsolete.

Bowmar Professor in Humanistic Studies.</em>If after such a debate American students leave college opposed to capitalism, then so be it. But never let them reach that conclusion without having first studied the murderous reality of what Communism has wrought for all of humanity.It’s time for university educators and their students to discuss openly the flaws of applied Marxism and the enormous damage it has caused. We need a no-holds-barred, free, and open debate on the comparative merits of Communism versus capitalism. If not now, when?Although the pernicious actions of the Chinese regime are sometimes denounced by university professors and administrators, too often links to the supporting ideology are omitted. Many academics still ignore the connection.While the Chinese regime has been credited by some for bringing hundreds of millions of people up from poverty, the credit belongs to the Chinese people themselves, enterprising and hard-working as they are. The regime merely got out of the way after decades of disastrous social engineering. Oppression still exists, particularly for Uighurs, Tibetans, defenders of civil liberties in Hong Kong, and outspoken people everywhere in China.The denunciation of Communism is left to those viewed as unsophisticates, retrogrades, or even racists by many elites and academics. Criticizing the Chinese Communist regime should not be viewed as a criticism of its people, and Communism should not get a pass because people fear being called racist.China has been ruthless in its quest to steal research, control information, and gain approval. It has distributed targeted funds to strategically selected academics in American universities (as seen in this year’s allegations How could Chinese authorities have acted so irresponsibly, and with such disregard for the welfare of others? The answer is that China remains a Communist tyranny, with the Chinese people among its greatest victims. All of humanity is now bearing the cost. A democratic government might have been blindsided and mishandled its initial response to the virus. Indeed, many democratic governments did just that. However, whistleblowers, accurate reporting, and aroused public opinion have quickly forced a change.

Nothing, it seems, can shake such a stubborn faith or such an insouciant blindness. Today, the overarching view in universities is that the global spread of COVID-19 is little more than an unfortunate natural event. Not caused by the Chinese regime’s repression, corruption, and flat-out lying. No one is to blame, and certainly not any particular political ideology. Or if there is an ideology to blame, it’s not Communism. Retired MIT professor Today in academia, one is far more likely to hear about the depredations of capitalism than the ravages of Communism. Calling oneself a Marxist has long been trendy. According to the dominant narrative in much of U.S. higher education today, absolutely nothing. A well-documented left-wing bias in colleges and universities, particularly in those considered elite, produces students who are poorly prepared to recognize such behavior. Compounding the problem, history plays a smaller role in secondary education than it once did, and civics has all but disappeared.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

No charge.The ill-treatment of Samaritan’s Purse and its selfless volunteers demonstrates that officials in New York no longer view the “other side” of the marriage and sexuality debates as anything but obstacles to the “inclusive” society — a goal apparently more precious even than the lives of New York City’s COVID patients.There are issues where either there is no “other side” in any more than a formalistic sense, or where “the other side” is demonstrably “regressive” and impedes possible improvement of the human condition. To tolerate propaganda for inhumanity vitiates the goals not only of liberalism but of every progressive political philosophy.In a 1968 postscript to “Repressive Tolerance,” Marcuse wrote,Most striking was Johnson’s decision to defend “inclusion” and “diversity” by excluding those with unfashionable views from the city. This Orwellian sense of “inclusion” recalls Herbert Marcuse’s essay on “repressive tolerance” — a defense of a “liberating tolerance” that requires “In this telling, the charity’s offense was requiring its volunteers to affirm the Samaritan’s Purse statement of faith, which contained blasphemous views on LGBT issues. New York City effectively banished Samaritan’s Purse for failing to adhere to its own One marvels at the abuse of language by protesters and elected officials. State senator Brad Hoylman, for instance, claimed that the city’s mere “association with Franklin Graham and Samaritan’s Purse” inflicted “reputational harm with LGBTQ New Yorkers and the wider public.” The suggestion that Samaritan’s Purse — an organization that brought volunteers to the front lines of a collapsing hospital system at no charge to the city — was somehow It is now clear — if it wasn’t before — that the leaders of our cultural revolution are not interested in coexisting with their perceived enemies. So appalled were the city’s leaders by the mere presence of volunteers with traditionalist views on marriage and sexuality that they refused their help in the middle of a lethal pandemic. Johnson conceded that the “battle against COVID-19 is still ongoing,” and the city “still needs support” in defeating the virus. Even with lives on the line, Johnson resolved that “a city that values diversity and compassion for all” could not, in effect, defile itself by coexisting with the ideologically unclean. Metaphors abound, but practically speaking, what message are Johnson and New York’s elected officials sending to the observant Jews, Christians, and — yes — Muslims in the city who hold beliefs identical to those espoused by Samaritan’s Purse?
The demonstrations outside the Samaritan’s Purse COVID-19 field hospital have been covered, perhaps too closely. Many of the protesters were clearly disturbed. Their anger at an innocuous group of religious volunteers provided a window into some of the excesses of LGBT politics and the desperation for enemies in a moment in history when enemies are scarce. But the protesters were a small, if vocal, group without much pull. The way in which the presence of Samaritan’s Purse has exercised the organs of government, however — the city council, the New York is an inclusive city, he says: Get the hell out.Since the coronavirus pandemic began, the volunteers for Samaritan’s Purse, an Evangelical relief organization run by the televangelist Franklin Graham, have been the most notable heretics in New York City. After weeks of protest from the city’s diversity clerics, the volunteers are at last collapsing the group’s field hospital, disinfecting its tents, and leaving New York City in apparent disgrace. In two weeks, the volunteers will return home, shunned by the city whose sick they treated free of charge without regard to race, religion, or sexual preference. The city officials who usher them out offer the group nothing but scorn: A New York treats its blasphemers better than Pakistan does, but neither society seems eager to tolerate those who offend its most basic religious convictions.<span class=""drop"">I</span>

Ferguson declined to release his original code so other scientists could check his results. He only released a heavily revised set of code last week, after a six-week delay.In 2009, a government estimate, based on Ferguson’s advice, said a “reasonable worst-case scenario” was that the swine flu would lead to 65,000 British deaths. In the end, swine flu killed 457 people in the U.K.In 2005, Ferguson predicted that up to 150 million people could be killed from bird flu. In the end, only 282 people died worldwide from the disease between 2003 and 2009.In 2002, Ferguson Ferguson was behind the disputed research that sparked the mass culling of eleven million sheep and cattle during the 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. Charlotte Reid, a farmer’s neighbor, recalls: “I remember that appalling time. Sheep were left starving in fields near us. Then came the open air slaughter. The poor animals were panic stricken. It was one of the worst things I’ve witnessed.

No charge.But such thorny issues are, if anything, one more reason to think Congress is going to send states money for elections without strings attached, rather than attempting to impose a universal set of election procedures on them: The low-hanging fruit is the likeliest to get picked. There will, of course, be significant fights in the states and the courts over expanded absentee voting. Snead urges states to ban “ballot-harvesting” — the practice of third-party collection of ballots — in order to combat potential intimidation and voter fraud as well as the spread of the virus. Yet, in January, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals It remains unclear whether Democrats in Congress will dig in on forcing states to adopt particular election procedures, but there’s good reason to think Republicans would be open to sending money to the states for elections without strings attached. Congress already agreed in the CARES Act to appropriate While Weiser would prefer to see Congress “set some minimum standards for what kinds of procedures need to be in place” in November’s elections, she says “the most important thing Congress can do is get money to the states and localities. That needs to happen, and it needs to happen quickly.”“Even without changing any rules about the election, states are going to incur significant costs just to be able to respond to the changing ways in which Americans are going to be voting,” says Weiser. She points to the additional need for personal protective equipment, poll workers, improved computer systems for voter registration and requesting ballots, and paper and postage for mail-in ballots. In Wisconsin’s April elections, she notes, not all absentee ballots were processed in time, and in November twice as many such votes will be cast in the state.The April 7 election in Wisconsin proved as much: With only a few weeks’ notice following the outbreak of the coronavirus, more than 70 percent of Wisconsin voters opted to cast absentee votes by mail or voted early in person, sometimes at drive-in, curbside polling places. (Wisconsin’s election also proved that in-person voting, with proper precautions, In other words, even if states pass no new legislation regarding how to conduct the November elections, the states that are going to decide control of the White House and the Senate are going to hold elections where the overwhelming majority of voters vote absentee or early.Twenty-nine “It makes sense to see expanded absentee voting” amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Snead says, because it would “make sure that people who are among the most vulnerable elements of society have the opportunity to get a ballot and vote safely.”But here again, there’s reason to believe a partisan fight will be avoided, because it seems unlikely states are going to completely switch to California-style all-mail elections. “It would be impossible for a state to have an all-mail election on such short notice,” says Wendy Weiser of the liberal-leaning Brennan Center. “I think what everybody is really going towards is moving as many voters as possible to mail ballots while maintaining polling-place options.”Many conservatives and Republicans are wary of making the kind of all-mail elections run in a handful of states, such as California, the nationwide norm, seeing that as a recipe for disaster. “I don’t think that we should be seeing an election in which ballots are sent directly to all people registered because of, among other things, the inaccuracies of voter-registration records nationwide and the logistical burdens that would impose,” says Jason Snead, the executive director of the Honest Elections Project, which he founded in February after working for a decade at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
McConnell opposes the federal government’s forcing states to run elections in a particular way, but he hasn’t objected to providing more funding to the states to assist with the November elections, and Pelosi hasn’t yet insisted upon attaching strings to such funds.This disagreement is real, but if you look a little closer, the divide between Democrats and Republicans may not be as stark as it seems.Meanwhile, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell adamantly opposes the federal government’s usurping the states’ power to run their own elections. “The federal government is not going to take over the way we do elections,” McConnell told the Congressional Democrats are proposing to give states roughly $4 billion “to enact a slew of policies that range from requiring states to enable online and same-day voter registration, to mandating prepaid postage on mail-in ballots, to a nationwide minimum of 15 consecutive days of early voting,” the <span class=""drop"">W</span>

To climate-shame corporations without the sanction of law or regulation will extinguish the economic dynamism that justifies capitalism. Remove its capacity to do so, and we will have entered a post-capitalist era. This is how capitalism ends.The arrogation of the rule-making prerogatives of a democratic state by a handful of climate activists raises profound questions on the demarcation between the rightful domains of politics and of business. It also raises profound questions about the future of capitalism. “Capitalism pays the people that strive to bring it down,” Joseph Schumpeter, the greatest economist of capitalism, observed in the 1940s. They won’t succeed, but for the efforts of soft anti-capitalists within the capitalist system.If governments — the legal parties to the Paris Agreement — have no collective intention to achieve net zero, why should America’s corporations? There is no environmental, economic, or ethical good when a corporation cuts its carbon dioxide emissions to meet the net-zero target when the rest of the world doesn’t, unless, that is, you’re one of the select few who believes that self-impoverishment is inherently virtuous. Yet corporations are increasingly being held to ransom by billionaire climate activists like Mike Bloomberg and BlackRock’s Larry Fink with the demand that they commit to net zero, make their shareholders and stakeholders poorer, and give a leg up to their competitors in the rest of the world, especially in the Far East.Led by Britain, several European countries have legislated net-zero targets without having a clue how they might meet them or their economic impact. Indeed, Britain can claim to be the world’s leading climate hypocrite. Having offshored its manufacturing base to China and the European Union, it is the G-7’s You don’t have to be a Milton Friedman to fathom the incompatibility with free markets and capitalist growth of what the IPCC terms “enhanced institutional capabilities” and “stringent policy interventions.” So it’s easy to understand why the governments of the world have no intention of achieving net zero by 2050. As Todd Stern, one of the principal architects of the Paris agreement,  Rather than address the possibility of a sustained slump in economic activity the IPCC’s approach is to say the benefits of holding the line at 1.5°C are — surprise, surprise! — greater than at 2 degrees Centigrade while studiously ignoring the extra costs of the more ambitious target. A few numbers show why. A carbon tax sufficiently high to drive emissions to net zero would range up to $6,050 per metric ton, over 60 times the  Thanks to COVID-19, we have a foretaste of what the IPCC intends. It envisages, for example, the industrial sector cutting its emissions by between 67 and 91 percent by 2050, implying a contraction in industrial output so dramatic as to make the 1930s Great Depression look like a walk in the park, a possibility the IPCC choses to ignore. The IPCC places its bets on a massive transition to wind and solar, but no amount of wishful thinking can overcome the inherent physics of their low energy density and their intermittency, which explains why countries with the highest proportion of wind and solar on their grids also have the highest energy costs in the world. One option the IPCC does not favor — a wholesale transition to nuclear power — seems unachievable anyway on the timetable it has in mind. Nuclear power stations typically take The IPCC makes no bones about viewing net zero, it says, as providing the opportunity for ‘intentional societal transformation.’ Limiting the rise to rise in global temperature to no more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels — an ill-defined baseline chosen by the U.N. because the Industrial Revolution is our civilization’s original sin — requires ‘transformative systemic change’ and ‘very ambitious, internationally cooperative policy environments that transform both supply and demand.’
That timeline is now being used to bully American corporations into aligning their business strategies with the Paris agreement and force them to commit to eliminating greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. In fact, the text of the Paris agreement speaks of achieving a balance between anthropogenic sources and removals “in the second half of this century.” The net-zero target has no standing in American law or regulation. Net zero is not about a few tweaks here and there. It necessitates a top-down coercive revolution the likes of which have never been seen in any democracy. This is spelt out in the Help was at hand. As skeptics had long been pointing out, IPCC lead author Myles Allen Having incorporated 1.5°C into the sacred texts of the U.N. climate process, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was charged with coming up with a scientific justification for it. In 2018, the IPCC published its report on the 1.5°C limitThe sinking-islands trope has been endlessly recycled by the U.N. for decades.

No doubt, President Trump made all Yesterday I noted that there’s “We now have enough data to feel pretty confident that New York was the primary gateway for the rest of the country,” said Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health.The findings are drawn from geneticists’ tracking signature mutations of the virus, travel histories of infected people and models of the outbreak by infectious disease experts.The research indicates that a wave of infections swept from New York City through much of the country before the city began setting social distancing limits to stop the growth. That helped to fuel outbreaks in Louisiana, Texas, Arizona and as far away as the West Coast.New York City’s coronavirus outbreak grew so large by early March that the city became the primary source of new infections in the United States, new research reveals, as thousands of infected people traveled from the city and seeded outbreaks around the country.But you don’t have to live in or close to <strong>As New York Goes, So Goes the Country</strong>At first we were warned not to wear masks. The M.T.A. said it would panic the public. The M.T.A. takes stern action against workers seen without goggles or cotton knit safety gloves. Yet we had to work without protection against the coronavirus.The irony was that we didn’t have soap and water. At my terminal at that time, the restrooms were closed for three days after a water main break. Most employee restrooms are in similarly bad shape. Crew rooms are packed.In mid-March, a bulletin came out mandating that conductors make an announcement every 15 minutes. Wash hands, soap and water, sanitizer, elbow-sneeze. “Together we can help keep New York safe.”Even worse, the transit authority’s management handled this as badly as any cynic would fear:A Metro Transit Authority conductor wrote in the And beyond the question of whether public transportation will have enough riders to remain financially viable, contemplate whether large metropolitan public transportation systems will be able to find workers.The consequences of this argument will be long-lasting. Everyone knows we’re going to be living with this virus for a while; if the subways are perceived as the place you’re most likely to catch the virus, people will avoid it for at least the coming year, and maybe more. People who can afford alternative ways to get around will choose those options. The inability to get around the city safely will be Yet the idea of subways being one of the main vectors of the virus’s spread makes complete sense: lots of people, often crowded together with much less than six feet separating them, breathing recirculated air, sitting in the same seats, touching the same poles and handrails and turnstiles and subway card machines.

Age also played a factor, the data shows that 73 percent of people being hospitalized were 51 and older, the survey found.“This is a surprise: Overwhelmingly, the people were at home,” Cuomo said during a briefing on Long Island. “We thought maybe they were taking public transportation, and we’ve taken special precautions on public transportation, but actually no, because these people were literally at home.”The governor said it was “shocking” that 66 percent of new coronavirus hospitalizations are people who are either retired or unemployed and not commuting to work on a regular basis.The majority of recently hospitalized coronavirus patients in New York are people who have followed the precaution of staying home, Gov. Cuomo said Wednesday.It took a long time for the lockdown to “bend the curve,” and somehow, people staying at home are apparently still catching the virus. We should also note that no one would paint either New York State or the city as being a slouch when it comes to lockdowns . . . and yet they still saw the horrific and rapid spread that they did. Back on March 20, New York governor Andrew Cuomo issued new restrictions declaring, “non-essential workers should stay inside their homes at all times except for critical travel, such as going to the grocery store or pharmacy.” The lockdown will be in place until at least May 15, with subsequent extensions likely “The problem has stopped getting worse” is not the same as “the problem is solved.”New York City’s new case total for Monday is higher than the new case total reported Wednesday in the states of Kentucky, Arkansas, Utah, New Mexico, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Rhode Island, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Washington, Wisconsin, Kansas, Connecticut, Arizona, Louisiana, Delaware, Colorado, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, the District of Columbia, or Michigan. Only twelve states have higher number of new cases — and that includes the rest of the state of New York. Of course, some of this reflect the city’s larger and denser population — if New York City was a state, its 8.3 million residents would be around our 11th-largest — but the upshot is that while New York City is “bending the curve,” that curve still has a long way to go.Still, Monday’s new case total in New York City is higher than the Wednesday’s case total for Alaska, Hawaii, Vermont, Wyoming, Maine, Idaho, West Virginia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, and New Hampshire . . .

Her successor, Boris Johnson, has endorsed this target, and so (the If something akin to the COVID-19 economy for decades is what you want, going for ‘net zero’ by 2050 may be a way to achieve it.Thanks to COVID-19, we have a foretaste of what the IPCC intends. It envisages, for example, the industrial sector cutting its emissions by between 67 and 91 percent by 2050, implying a contraction in industrial output so dramatic as to make the 1930s Great Depression look like a walk in the park, a possibility the IPCC choses to ignore. The IPCC places its bets on a massive transition to wind and solar, but no amount of wishful thinking can overcome the inherent physics of their low energy density and their intermittency, which explains why countries with the highest proportion of wind and solar on their grids also have the highest energy costs in the world. One option the IPCC does not favor — a wholesale transition to nuclear power — seems unachievable anyway on the timetable it has in mind. Nuclear power stations typically take well over five years to build, and not many are planned for now. Germany is switching out of nuclear power, the Japanese are, to quote the New York Times “racing to build new coal-burning . . . plants” and the Chinese are wary of overdoing their nuclear construction because of the risk of accident.The IPCC makes no bones about viewing net zero, it says, as providing the opportunity for ‘intentional societal transformation.’ Limiting the rise to rise in global temperature to no more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels — an ill-defined baseline chosen by the U.N. because the Industrial Revolution is our civilization’s original sin — requires ‘transformative systemic change’ and ‘very ambitious, internationally cooperative policy environments that transform both supply and demand.’Rupert Darwall 1.5C is the target that emerged from the [“If Covid-19 leads to a drop in emissions of around 5% in 2020, then that is the sort of reduction we need every year until net-zero emissions are reached around 2050,” said Glen Peters… from Cicero.To keep the world on track to stay under 1.5C this century, the world needs similar cuts for the foreseeable future to keep this target in view.From a National ReviewFollow Us",0,The COVID-19 Economy and a Taste of ‘Net Zero’

Far more than he and his fellow Democrats think it is.He signed the bill in a ceremony on the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in To Cuomo, it appears to be worth something only when it is located outside the birth canal. Last January, the governor enacted one of the most radical abortion laws in the country. It permitted abortion for any reason up to 24 weeks, after fetal viability, and made it easier to obtain an abortion until birth.How much is a human life worth?As health-care professionals around the country work tirelessly to save lives from the coronavirus, abortion advocates fight to continue intentionally taking them.  
   To comply with the stay-at-home order in Pennsylvania, Planned Parenthood closed every clinic save those that perform abortions. In Colorado, the president of the local Planned Parenthood affiliate described the number of abortions performed at her clinics as “pretty extraordinary,” citing an increase in women traveling from out of state.  
   Meanwhile, advocates of unlimited elective abortion have used the pandemic to The same day, he signed into law the Reproductive Health Protection Act, allowing non-physicians to perform abortions, removing parental-consent requirements for minors seeking an abortion, and removing standard informed-consent procedures.In Virginia, Democratic governor Ralph Northam outlined his response to the spread of COVID-19 in nursing homes, tweeting, “We will continue to do everything possible to help the Virginians living and working in these facilities. These are our parents and grandparents, and we have an obligation to protect them.”Several other states have designated abortion “essential,” even as they place strict limits on most health-care procedures in order to curb the spread of disease and conserve medical supplies.In Michigan, Whitmer deemed elective abortion “essential,” even as she limited most medical procedures as part of the state’s coronavirus response. “A woman’s health care, her whole future, her ability to decide if and when she starts a family is not an election,” Whitmer said. “It is a fundamental to her life. It is life-sustaining, and it’s something that government should not be getting in the middle of.”Yet instead of responding to abortion the way they’ve responded to the pandemic, pursuing every possible means of saving as many lives as they can, Democratic politicians have carved out a space to allow abortion to carry on despite the health risks.As much as Democrats might wish otherwise, abortion isn’t a routine health-care procedure to remove an unwanted clump of cells or an inhuman parasite from a woman. Abortion intentionally kills a genetically distinct, living human being — that woman’s son or daughter. The small size of a fetus makes her no less valuable than the adult men and women dying of COVID-19. Her location inside her mother renders her no less unique, no less human, and no less worthy of life.It is difficult, though, to take these politicians seriously when they and their party intensely oppose offering protection of any kind to human life in the womb — and when supporters of abortion rights have capitalized on the COVID-19 crisis to push their preferred abortion policies.It has been good to hear these and other politicians, on both sides of the aisle, affirm the value of life and place such an emphasis on crafting policy that attempts to recognize its dignity. It has been reassuring, too, to witness the willingness of Americans to temporarily sacrifice a great deal of freedom, and in many cases their livelihoods, to reduce the risk to the most vulnerable.
Earlier this week, Cuomo doubled down on his rhetoric as he argued against reopening the economy, asking at a news conference, “How much is a human life worth? . . . To me, I say the cost of a human life, a human life is priceless.”Defending her harsh lockdown policies in Michigan, Democratic governor Just yesterday, Joe Biden expressed the same sentiment. “I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: No one is expendable.

In its outward-facing communications, the Trump administration has continued to tout the supposed effectiveness of its response. But up to now, the American people have faced down this pandemic on their own, while their president attempts to market his way out of another crisis.Our nation has the capacity and resources to accomplish what has been accomplished in East Asia and what is beginning to be accomplished in Europe. All the pieces of the system needed to do so are being developed. They may begin to be assembled through private efforts alone. But assembling them with speed and with a straight line of communication to the public would require real leadership from a White House willing and able to solve coordination problems and blend the efforts of private actors, states, and municipalities into a coherent national plan.Fitting all these moving parts together into a workable test-and-trace system is the kind of coordination problem that an energetic White House could solve. It’s certainly not a task beyond the capability of other Western governments. Germany, with a robust test-trace-and-isolate regime in place, has already re-opened, having avoided the type of outbreaks seen in Italy, Spain, and France. The United Kingdom has begun its pilot test-and-trace program in the Isle of Wight. Why is the U.S. so far behind?
Moreover, testing is only part of the puzzle: It needs to be joined to a contact-tracing system. Even a primitive tracing operation would require tremendous manpower to conduct interviews and inform those exposed. A more advanced one, like those used in South Korea, would incorporate data generated by cell phones. But the federal government hasn’t indicated whether it would set up its own contact-tracing app (as Germany and the U.K. have done), or whether it would build on existing private efforts, such as the one at Columbia University and the one being jointly developed by Google and Apple, which has been criticized by some governments for protecting users’ privacy at the expense of insight into the spread of the disease.<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/05/01/google-verily-covid-testing/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">By the end of April</a>To hear the president tell it then, one expected to see the quick roll-out of drive-through testing centers in the parking lots of Walmart and Target retailers. CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid were said to be joining in, too. Google would launch an easy-to-use website helping people determine whether they should get a test, and directing them where to get one. This should have been the beginning of America’s test-and-trace scheme. But of course, it wasn’t.On Friday, March 13, after weeks of criticism of his disorganized response to the pandemic, Trump offered an answer: an “extraordinary public-private partnership.” China had controlled the virus with its massive, repressive state apparatus. South Korea and Singapore had done so with their more nimble states and publics conditioned for such a fight by the 2003 SARS outbreak. Trump’s new approach felt very American: Our marquee corporations would coordinate with the White House to beat the coronavirus. Stocks made a major rebound as Trump gathered a squadron of CEOs and announced the various initiatives on the White House lawn that Friday.There’s a term in Silicon Valley for software that’s advertised before anyone can guarantee it will even exist. It’s called “vaporware.” Much of the federal government’s response to the crisis has been vaporware. We’ve gotten lots of advertising and an implicit promise of a world-class operation to fight the disease. But it doesn’t exist yet and it’s becoming clearer that the White House is spinning its wheels, looking for something — anything — to do other than solving the crisis at hand.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

Some businesses are trying to ramp up hiring even while others are laying off workers, and policy should allow individuals to respond to market incentives, rather than condition aid to businesses on their retention of workers regardless of how much those workers are needed.They also list Certificate of Need (CON) regulations (they mention Policy responses to major shocks and inherited features of the policy landscape can further stretch out the creation response, slowing the recovery. In this regard, we discuss four aspects of U.S. policy that can retard creation responses to the pandemic-induced reallocation shock: Unemployment benefit levels that exceed earnings for many American workers under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, policies that subsidize employee retention irrespective of the employer’s longer term outlook, occupational licensing restrictions [that] impede mobility across occupations and states, and regulations that inhibit business formation and expansion.Next comes a must-read discussion of the economic forces that will slow down the recover by reducing the job reallocation, including:Drawing on our survey evidence and historical evidence of how layoffs relate to recalls, we estimate that 42 percent of recent pandemic-induced layoffs will result in permanent job loss. If the pandemic and partial economic shutdown linger for many months, or if pandemics with serious health consequences and high mortality rates become a recurring phenomenon, there will be profound, long-term consequences for the reallocation of jobs, workers and capital across firms and locations.In other words, the COVID-19 shock caused 3 new hires in the near term for every 10 layoffs. These sizable new hires amidst a tremendous overall contraction align well with our anecdotal evidence of large pandemic-induced increases in demand at certain firms. …They then go on to explain how the developing “evidence on the extent and character of this reallocation shock for the U.S.” They summarize their results this way:As noted in a recent Wall Street Journal article, “The coronavirus pandemic is forcing the fastest reallocation of labor since World War II, with companies and governments mobilizing an army of idled workers into new activities that are urgently needed.” In other words, Covid-19 is also a major reallocation shock.This National ReviewFollow Us",0,CARES Act and Regulatory Fixes Needed for a Faster Recovery

As a recent Department of Education complaint about universities reporting income from China makes clear, there is big money involved: Yale alone may, according to the DOE, have failed to report $375 million in overall foreign financial support. So, too, is there the risk that intellectual cooperation is a one-way street, as seen in the recent case of a Harvard chemistry professor charged with lying to federal officials about being paid to share his research with the Chinese government. But the greatest risk of all may be selling legitimacy to an illegitimate regime.Of course, one never knows what seeds one plants, perhaps even over informal dinner discussions. I recall quietly citing the work of Harvard economist Dani Rodrik, finding that economic growth is more likely to be sustained over time in democratic societies. Perhaps the right person was listening. But I fear not: Cooperation between Harvard and the Chinese Communist Party government continues today, even as it is increasingly clear that the country is becoming less, not more, free.  As the class went on, it became clear that Harvard’s involvement had unforeseen effects on the enterprise we were all engaged in. Chinese officials would now be able to boast of having been trained by Harvard professors, and local officials who were participating were getting the message that the Communist Party had, in some sense, the approval of Harvard. What’s more, officials from the Organization Department — the HR branch of the Party Central Committee — were in the class, likely evaluating the hand-picked up-and-comers who were our students on grounds of political correctness. Over time, we noticed that participants were looking to senior officials for guidance as to what to say.I’d never encountered that sort of response to the La Paz case before, although I’d taught it around the world. The important thing, it seemed, was for the Chinese government’s middle managers to demonstrate to officials higher up the food chain that the corruption problem was contained. In the People’s Republic, the “people” really didn’t play a role in the government’s thinking. Arguably, the same systemic weakness could be seen in the belated response in Wuhan. Secrecy is a feature, not a bug, of the CCP system, and it has real consequences.I recall specifically our discussion of a case I wrote myself, about police corruption in La Paz, Bolivia. It tells the story of a reform-minded mayor of La Paz dealing with a largely illiterate and corrupt local police force. The mayor, Ronald MacLean, who went on to co-found Transparency International, considered a variety of ways to weed out the corrupt from the force and motivate the rest. But his approach was not embraced by the class. One official had a dramatically different and revealing perspective. The mayor, he said, should simply assemble a “secret army of replacement police” and, without warning one morning, have them swoop in and take over, replacing all the current cops, who would be brought up on charges. Might that not spark popular resentment? Would police work improve? The questions did not resonate.Despite such promising signs, the program, it turned out, also took some ominous turns that made clear the serious limitations of outside efforts to reform China — and foreshadowed the COVID-19 crisis.The central figure in the case was Hong Kong’s public-health commissioner, Margaret Chan, who went on to become the head of the World Health Organization. When it was revealed that live-market chickens were the likely cause of the bird flu, Chan told Hong Kong residents, “I eat chicken every day.” Eventually, Hong Kong chose to kill every chicken in the territory, a decision widely judged to have saved the world from the illness. Our students mocked Chan’s statement as the Hong Kong public had, thus opening the door to the idea of accountability for public officials and citizen influence over public policy, both foreign concepts in China. And because the story had a relatively happy ending, another essential principle was made plain: It’s possible to make mistakes in handling a public-health crisis but they are best openly acknowledged and corrected.
One such case directly foreshadowed the coronavirus pandemic. It dealt with Hong Kong’s response to the bird-flu epidemic of 1997, and it was meant to provoke discussion about how officials speak to the public at times of crisis: Can reassurance and candor be reconciled?My role was to teach classes by the famous Harvard case method, in which narratives (cases) framed political or policy decisions to be discussed and argued over. Open debate alone represented the possibility of progress for China, or so I told myself. Of course, we were using cases set in other countries, in order, we hoped, not to upset Chinese government officials.It was above my pay grade to question whether the school should have entered into such a relationship in the first place. As I reflect, it’s possible that we planted some seeds for a freer society — but it’s just as likely that we helped provide legitimacy for a totalitarian government.How to handle crisis was part of the curriculum when the Harvard Kennedy School struck a deal with the Beijing government to provide public-management education for local officials from across China. I have no idea whether the mayor of Wuhan was in the group I helped teach, but it’s quite possible. Our goal was to expose local and regional officials to Kennedy School-style techniques, which combine technocratic policy analysis with political leadership. It didn’t take long to see that the school’s dedication to fostering “freer” societies was going to be tested in the weeks a group of faculty spent at Tsinghua, thanks to what I understood to be the cooperation of the opaquely named Organization Department of the Central Committee.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>The national media have paid copious amounts of attention to the risk of spreading the coronavirus in places like the beaches of Florida and the reopening of businesses in Georgia. A refocus of the national media’s attention and criticism upon the nursing homes in states like California, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York is long overdue. A lot of people have relished accusing the anti-lockdown protesters of “killing grandma.” It is time we took a more serious look at what lawmakers’ decisions led most directly to the deaths of so many grandmothers and grandfathers.Right now, a lot of people really want to believe that as bad as the coronavirus outbreak is, the consequences have been mitigated by good decisions made by governors like Gavin Newsom, J. D. Pritzker, Gretchen Whitmer, Tom Wolf, Phil Murphy, and Andrew Cuomo. But those governors, whatever their other strengths, all presided over state governments that served their nursing homes and assisted living facilities poorly — either through an inability to provide protective equipment (Illinois), insufficient attention (Pennsylvania), or by sending recovering but still contagious patients back into buildings with lots of other vulnerable elderly (California, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York).A defensive Cuomo on Tuesday claimed the state had done “everything you can” to keep the coronavirus from spreading among New York’s seniors. But that’s just not true.No Sunshine State patient can be discharged from a hospital into a nursing home without a negative test result. Florida hospitals had already refused to send coronavirus-positive patients back; the new rule means even those who show no symptoms must be tested and confirmed negative.The So why on earth did his health commissioner, Howard Zucker, force nursing homes to take in virus-positive patients starting March 25?Cuomo downplayed the count Tuesday: “I would take all of these numbers now with a grain of salt,” since “what does a ‘presumed death’ mean, right?”The new Health Department info released late Monday adds 1,700 presumed coronavirus deaths to the grim total, suggesting that COVID-19 complications have killed 4,813 residents of nursing homes and adult-care facilities — and that doesn’t include those who died in hospitals.Notice the New York state policy “The State of New Jersey has direct regulatory oversight over these nursing facilities.  Although the population of nursing homes makes up less than 0.7% of the Garden State’s population, the 4,151 deaths in these facilities accounts for half of all New Jersey’s COVID-19 deaths,” concluded Senator Pennacchio.“New Jersey has continually cited testing as a way to identify and respond to COVID-19.  Therefore, it doesn’t make sense that we would specifically not want to test patients who would enter isolated nursing homes containing our most vulnerable population,” said Pennacchio (R-Morris, Essex, Passaic).The letter also states “post-acute care facilities are Senator Joe Pennacchio has obtained a letter sent by the New Jersey Department of Health dated March 31 directing hospitals and nursing care facilities not to inhibit transfer of hospital patients with COVID-19 entering post-acute care settings such as long-term nursing and rehabilitations facilities.Notice the New Jersey policy Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine, testifying Thursday before two Senate committees, said the state focused its response in the early days of the Pennsylvania crisis on hospitals because it wanted to be prepared for a potential surge of patients.This week, the nursing homes operated by Lehigh and Northampton counties, Cedarbrook and Gracedale, respectively, both reported sharp increases in deaths.But about 80% of deaths newly reported by the state Thursday ― 247 out of 310 ― were at the facilities. In the Lehigh Valley, the state reported 177 deaths in such facilities, with 77 in Lehigh County and 100 in Northampton County. The region has seen 263 deaths overall.A total of 3,416 coronavirus deaths has been reported statewide through Thursday. Of those, 2,355, or nearly 69%, were associated with nursing or personal care homes.“There is no excuse for what is going on, OK?” said Chester County state Sen. Andrew Dinniman, who like Gov. Tom Wolf is a Democrat. “The Department of Health has failed our nursing homes.”The escalating tragedy in Pennsylvania Notice the Pennsylvania policy described by Despite promises from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for better transparency on senior care during the pandemic, Wilson’s mother lives in an assisted-living facility — and Michigan doesn’t collect information about coronavirus at the home or 4,000 others like it statewide.And by The move followed an executive order by the Governor outlining rules for treating COVID-19 patients at long-term care facilities after they were discharged from hospitals. Patients would be isolated, the order required, and staff were required to wear appropriate personal protection equipment.A Sterling Heights senior care center saw a spike in COVID-19 cases among residents after accepting two dozen positive patients recently discharged from area hospitals.Notice the Michigan policy described by Chicago’s WGN reports, “More than 40 percent of COVID-19 deaths in Illinois have been Notice the complaints described by That need continues to grow. As of May 3, nearly 10,000 patients and staff in long-term care facilities in the state of California have tested positive for the virus, and 926 of them have died, according to figures released by DSS, which oversees assisted living, and the California Department of Public Health.But health experts and advocates say the plan risks introducing the virus into facilities that have been spared or those already dealing with their own outbreaks.A letter from the state Department of Social Services sent to licensees of senior and adult care residential facilities on Friday urged them to temporarily take in patients who have tested positive for the virus — for up to $1,000 a day — to make room in hospitals for people who become critically ill and require acute care.Even as senior care centers have been particularly hard hit by the coronavirus — with patient and staff deaths accounting for nearly 40 percent of all COVID-19 deaths across California — the Notice the California policy described by You could make a strong argument that the country’s deadly coronavirus problem is largely a nursing home problem, dangerous everywhere but far more prevalent in a half-dozen or so of the country’s more heavily and densely populated states. What’s more, many of these states enacted coronavirus response policies that likely put nursing and assisted-living home residents at higher risk for infection.Coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes have been particularly deadly in California, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Bad State Decisions about Nursing Homes Are Heavily Driving the Coronavirus Outbreak

It would mean that stock markets were extremely inefficient at processing information.I don’t really see what the mystery is. Everyone realized that we were going to go through a major economic contraction, including massive job losses, before we actually did, and trading reflected that knowledge. As information about the scale of the economic problem we faced made it look more and more dire from roughly Feb 20 to March 23, markets declined. That they have partly bounced back since then suggests that markets are more optimistic about the economic hit we will take than they were at the low point are but still think it will be big.

Meanwhile the padre asked Your Sinful Correspondent again to a private Mass this week, if only to discuss afterwards the parish’s closing in 2021, the church itself (a place where an actual miracle occurred) to be locked, its fate unknown. Will we be grateful if it perhaps be used on occasion to host funerals of the dearly departed? Lament as we might, it’s hard to keep open the doors when vocations are stymied and the once-faithful convince themselves that Sunday’s obligation is now to sleep in. Ah, well — God will have to fix this, and plenty of other stuff too. If only we would ask. <strong><em>A Dios</em></strong>Underlying the new American ambition was dissatisfaction with the pace of projects that had been launched in the 1950s: civil rights law that had not desegregated train stations or schools, the construction of the interstate highways that didn’t seem to help the poor, urban renewal funding that could not meet the needs of all. Now the country wanted more, faster. In the 1960s America sensed “the fierce urgency of now,” as King put it. Most Americans shared something else with Harrington: confidence. In the 1930s, the New Deal had failed to reduce unemployment. The prolonged periods of joblessness were what had made the Depression “Great.” But the memory of the New Deal failure had faded just enough that younger people liked the sound of the term. And memories of more recent success fueled Americans’ current ambition. Many men were veterans. They had been among the victorious forces that rolled across Europe and occupied Japan at the end of World War II. Compared with overcoming a Great Depression, or conquering Europe and Japan, eliminating poverty or racial discrimination had to be easy. American society was already so good. To take it to great would be a mere “mopping up action,” as Norman Podhoretz, who had served in Europe, put it.There were not many self- described socialists in the country in the early 1960s. The Young People’s Socialist League, the premier socialist youth group, was reporting a doubling in membership across the colleges, but that increase was merely from four hundred to eight hundred members. Still, socialists such as Harrington were far from alone in their insistence on transcendent change. Many Americans ached to make American society over, whether by tinkering or rebuilding, in the name of improving life for all. In the early 1960s the groups that nursed this ambition were diverse. They were university students who hoped to fashion their own utopia— Harrington worked with a new group called Students for a Democratic Society, or SDS. There were union chiefs who sought explicitly to re-create the culture and benefits of socialism like that of Northern Europe, not just for union members, but also for the nation at large. There were government officials such as Shriver who believed the right president could indeed lead the country in epic reform. There were engineers who envisioned transformation through technology. There were businesses that thought great corporations would lead in raising the standard of living for all. Typical was General Electric, whose motto was “Progress is our most important product.” There were factory workers whose lives had improved in the 1960s and who hoped to finally make it into the middle class by the 1970s. There were priests, ministers, and rabbis who sought collective spiritual renewal in aspects of life far beyond their pulpits. There were civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King, who dreamed of a time when race would no longer matter.A tidbit: Here’s a slice from Amity’s Introduction to her book (the Harrington she refers to is Michael, the great liberal agitator of the early 1960s and author of the then-bestselling and consequential book Our pal Amity Shlaes’ book, <strong>Before We Part</strong>Of additional note: The one masochistic man to play for the Phillies and Phils and Blue Jays throughout this stretch was future Hall of Famer Of note: In 1942, hoping a name change and a new manager would reverse their sorry fortunes, the re-tagged “Phils” (they’d be the “Blue Jays” in 1944–45) under new manager After the three-year stint, Protho was done.

You like Mr. Botts and his bookstore. When Mr. Bezos opens his store, do you have a moral obligation to continue to pay the higher prices over at Mr. Botts’s store? Are you committing a moral wrong to decide to give your business to Mr. Bezos? Remember, if you and the other people in your town do not continue to shop at Mr. Botts’s store, it will close, and Mr. Botts will lose his job that he loves and that gave him purpose and meaning in his life. That is not an easy question to answer. It gets worse when you discover that Mr. Walton also came to town selling everything at a lower price than all the other little shops in town had been charging. What do you owe to all these people in your town who are about to lose the jobs they love? Suppose it would cost you an extra $20 a year to allow Mr. Botts to stay in business. Even a minimal charitable impulse would convince someone to spend that much to keep this friend and neighbor from losing the ability to work at the job that brings him so much pleasure.While not all of the problems identified by American Compass are economic problems, some are. Restricting our attention to those issues, what do we find? To crystallize the issues, let’s start with a story. Mr. Botts owns a bookstore in a small town. Ever since he was young, he wanted to own a bookstore; he loves his bookstore; his customers love his bookstore. Everything is wonderful. Then one day a new person comes into town and opens a brand new bookstore. Let’s call him Mr. Bezos. This new bookstore has a larger variety of books for sale than Mr. Botts ever had. Also, this new bookstore sells every single book at a lower price than over at Mr. Botts’s store. And, to top it all off, Mr. Bezos will deliver every book you buy to your home within two days, with no delivery charge.TRIPLE BONUS: Gene Z sent this and believes it deserves attention, and you know what? Gene is right. So James Hartley’s 9. Cruelty. “And where among all the preceding qualities was there any place left for kindheartedness? How could one possibility preserve one’s kindness while pushing away the hands of those who were drowning? Once you have been steeped in blood, you can only become more cruel. . . . And when you add that kindness was ridiculed, that pity was ridiculed, that mercy was ridiculed—you’d never be able to chain all those who were drunk on blood.”8. Lies. “The permanent lie becomes the only safe form of existence, in the same way as betrayal. Every wag of the tongue can be overheard by someone, every facial expression observed by someone. Therefore every word, if it does not have to be a direct lie, is nonetheless obliged not to contradict the general, common lie. There exists a collection of ready-made phrases, of labels, a selection of ready-made lies.DOUBLE BONUS: Brad Birzer at As for Locke, Rosenblatt reads him as Hobbes’s opposite. She links him to Ciceronian or classical liberality—a stretch—and writes he was convinced “[m]en in a state of nature were capable of knowing and following a moral law.” This is a far too conventional rendering of Locke’s truly audacious moral and political reflection. To begin, there is no moral law for Locke—morality is the product of “mixed modes,” constructed by human beings. Even the notion of “murder” is a linguistic construction rather than a prohibition rooted in divine or natural law. And because he jettisons the classical Christian notion of “substance,” it is very difficult to know who precisely To be sure, Rosenblatt recognizes that liberalism has an important pre-history. She has intelligent things to say about BONUS: Also in Neil Ferguson isn’t single-handedly responsible for this world-historical blunder, but he does bear some responsibility. His apocalyptic predictions frightened the British Government into imposing a full lockdown, with other governments quickly following suit. And I’m afraid he’s absolutely typical of the breed. He suffers from the same fundamental arrogance that progressive interventionists have exhibited since at least the middle of the 18th Century – wildly over-estimating the good that governments can do, assuming there are no limits to what “science” can achieve and, at the same time, ignoring the empirical evidence that their ambitious public programmes are a complete disaster. At bottom, they believe that nature itself can be bent to man’s will.More often than not, the “solutions” these left-leaning experts come up with make the problems they’re grappling with even worse, and so it will prove to be in this case. The evidence mounts on a daily basis that locking down whole populations in the hope of “flattening the curve” was a catastrophic error, perhaps the worst policy mistake ever committed by Western governments during peacetime. Just yesterday we 6. At Or consider the media’s approach to the numbers, which are the main story of any pandemic. Without accurate data, it is nearly impossible to get a handle on the scope and scale of a global public health crisis. And yet, from the beginning, China withheld information, silenced internal whistleblowers, and engaged in a concerted effort to stifle bad news about the pandemic.From the beginning, the WHO’s statements about the emerging virus read more like Chinese propaganda than global health recommendations. On January 30, for example, when WHO director general Tedros Ghebreyesus finally acknowledged that the virus posed a global health emergency, he made sure to note that “this declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China.” To the contrary, he added: “The WHO continues to have confidence in China’s capacity to control the outbreak.” Just a day earlier, other WHO officials praised China’s Xi Jinping for helping “prevent the spread of the virus to other countries,” even though by that point WHO officials knew the virus had already appeared in at least 18 other nations. And yet, with the exception of the In the past few months, many journalists have covered the coronavirus pandemic with rigor and integrity. One early warning about the danger of trusting China and the World Health Organization came in February in a well-reported piece by Jeremy Page and Betsy McKay in the 5. At In a The other six Republican lawmakers who signed on to the memo are: Virginia Foxx, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Labor; Mac Thornberry, ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee; Mike Rogers, ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland Security; Frank Lucas, ranking member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology; Devin Nunes, ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; and Michael McCaul, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.The lawmakers in the memo ask for the documents to be provided by May 11, as well as a staff-level briefing on the matter, noting the Committee on Oversight and Reform “has broad authority to investigate ‘any matter’ at ‘any time’ under House Rule X.”4. At The Danish Bible Society, disagreeing with those who criticized it for eliminating Israel from its Bible 2020, did not “take measures to correct” its mistranslations. Instead, the Danish Bible Society doubled down and insisted upon its bowdlerization.This sets the tone for the Danish Bible Society’s rejection of the international outcry against its version of the Bible. The Danish Bible Society seems to regard the international outcry as a gross injustice.<em>“Is the word ‘Israel’ omitted from the Contemporary Danish Bible 2020? Get your facts straight with this Q&amp;A so you can identify the fake news.”</em>The Danish Bible Society statement comes with the headline, “Fake news about the Danish Bible.” The subheading reads:Unlike the Bible Society of Israel presentation, the Danish Bible Society It is difficult not to see an intentional technique that eliminates the homeland of Israel and replaces it with a home for others; and that replaces the God of Israel with the God of you.3. Galling: At Gatestone Institute, Petra Heldt smotes the Danish Bible Society, which publishes a rump edition of the Holy Book that frequently drops the word “Israel.” You would have to be a very provincial person not to see that the problems traditionally associated with loyalty to two countries can become quite severe. A classic articulation of this worry was the Supreme Court dissent by Justice Melville Fuller in Dual citizenship undermines equal citizenship, producing a regime of constitutional haves and have-nots. The dual citizen has, at certain important moments and in certain important contexts, the right to choose the regime under which he lives. He can avoid military conscription, duck taxes, and flee prosecution. When Spain, as coronavirus cases spiked in mid-March, banned all movement outside the home except for designated purposes, one of those purposes was to “return to your habitual place of residence.” A Spaniard with citizenship in a second country thus had the constitutional privilege of exempting himself from a nationwide lockdown in a way that his fellow Spaniard did not. Such special privileges do not often matter—but when they do, they matter in a life-or-death way.There will always be a use for dual citizenship, especially in dealing with children of international marriages. But the old understanding was more right than wrong. The transformation from national citizens’ rights to universal human rights does divide loyalties and corrode sovereignties. On top of that, we are beginning to notice practical problems with mass dual citizenship that were hardly considered at all when we began dispensing it liberally at the sunny outset of the civil rights era.Political theorists used to think dual citizenship a dangerous thing because it presents occasions for dual loyalty and erodes the social compact on which all citizens’ rights depend. Under the newer understanding, that’s a feature rather than a bug. We live in an interconnected global economy in which we’re 2. Also in the Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich deplored this as “the greatest strategic disaster in U.S. history.” At stake are not only the sinews of the new industrial age, but scores of spinoff applications that will transform manufacturing, mining, health care, finance, transportation, and retailing—virtually the entirety of economic life—in what China calls the Fourth Industrial Revolution.China’s first great multinational company, Huawei, is rolling out fifth generation (5G) mobile broadband across the whole of Eurasia, from Vladivostok, Russia to Bristol, England, despite a full-court press by the Trump Administration to stop it. In January 2020 Great Britain—America’s closest ally—brushed off Trump’s personal intervention and allowed Huawei to build part of Britain’s 5G network. The European Community announced it would take no measures to exclude the Chinese giant. Washington tried to strangle Huawei by slapping export controls on U.S. components for 5G equipment and smartphones, only to see Huawei continue expanding using Asian components while achieving self-sufficiency in chip production.The past year was a watershed. As matters stand the United States will be overtaken by China in the next several years. China is developing its own intellectual property in key areas. Some of it is better than ours—in artificial intelligence, telecommunications, cryptography, and electronic warfare. In other key fields like quantum computing—possibly the holy grail of 21st-century technology—it’s hard to tell who’s winning, but China is outspending us by a huge margin.1.

If you tried to parody the sad decline of prestige awards in those fields into an ideologically blinkered self-congratulatory echo chamber for progressive agitprop, it would be difficult to find a more on-the-nose example than the Pulitzer Prize awarded to Nikole Hannah-Jones of the 16. More McLaughlin: Dan expounds on the Britain is currently in its seventh week of the lockdowns. In England and Wales, officials dispense a fine for breaking lockdown protocols every five minutes. Hypocrisy is the only remaining sin in secular Britain. Of course, the fact that Staats is married is neither here nor there. Brits no longer expect government officials and advisers to be faithful spouses. The infuriating part is that her first visit coincided with a public warning from Ferguson that lockdown measures were essential and would have to be prolonged. Meanwhile, her subsequent visits occurred after she had told friends that she suspected her husband had contracted COVID-19. Ferguson himself spent two weeks in “complete isolation,” having contracted coronavirus. So, here is a person instructing the country on how to live, in order to “save lives,” via the most draconian measures ever willingly tolerated in a liberal democracy, while flouting his own rules.All while lecturing the public on the importance of cooperating with nationwide house imprisonment, Ferguson was conducting an affair with his married lover, who travelled across London on multiple occasions to “visit” him. The timeline provided by 15. More Kearns: She gives the rundown on coronavirus modeler Neil Ferguson, personification of the Expert Commandment, “do as I say not as I do.” This is no story of a railroad that has fallen on hard times. Union Pacific is one of the most profitable railroads in the world. At most, walking out on its obligations to Palestine will save it less money than some of its executives make in annual bonuses. But it does fit a larger pattern: Underneath the media’s radar, the company has been leaving one town after another reeling from sudden terminations and layoffs in the interest of its own bottom line. From St. Louis and Kansas City in Missouri to Omaha and North Platte in Nebraska to the town of Hermiston in Oregon, Union Pacific has been terminating lifelong employees and union members for years.But then, last November, on the day before Thanksgiving, Union Pacific filed suit in federal court to have the 1954 agreement invalidated. It hopes, essentially, to take the money and run — to close up shop in Palestine, increasing its own profits by laying off scores of workers and leaving the community devastated.When Union Pacific railroad acquired MoPac in 1982, company executives were well-aware of the 1954 agreement and openly affirmed its validity. With Union Pacific’s much larger workforce, the percentage of its employees that had to be maintained in Palestine was much smaller, but otherwise the deal remained the same. In the decades that followed, Union Pacific repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to the 1954 agreement, and the people of Palestine continued to rely on it in setting their city-planning and economic-development policies.14. And then there is that Palestinian problem . . . the one in the Lone Star State. Steve Presley and Robert D. Johnson report on how the Union Pacific Railroad is trying to break a long-term deal that will result in screwing over a Texas city. That brings us to the smoking gun of the movie, the one story Obama has to offer of being indisputably the victim of a racist insult. While discussing her college years, she says, “I learned that one of my roommates moved out because her mother was horrified that I was black. She felt her daughter was in danger. I wasn’t prepared for that.” The story she tells in the memoir is different: She learned Obama tells us in the movie of suffering racial discomfort around Princeton, where “I was one of a handful of minority students. It was the first time in my life where I stood out like that.” She reports in her memoir that Princeton’s student body was “less than nine percent black,” but, since blacks were 12 percent of the U.S. population, Princeton was fairly representative of the country as a whole. It was her mostly black neighborhood back home that was atypical.13. Kyle Smith checks out the new Netflix documentary by and about Michelle Obama. He sees lots of tall tales. While the Chinese regime has been credited by some for bringing hundreds of millions of people up from poverty, the credit belongs to the Chinese people themselves, enterprising and hard-working as they are. The regime merely got out of the way after decades of disastrous social engineering. Oppression still exists, particularly for Uighurs, Tibetans, defenders of civil liberties in Hong Kong, and outspoken people everywhere in China.The denunciation of Communism is left to those viewed as unsophisticates, retrogrades, or even racists by many elites and academics. Criticizing the Chinese Communist regime should not be viewed as a criticism of its people, and Communism should not get a pass because people fear being called racist.China has been ruthless in its quest to steal research, control information, and gain approval. It has distributed targeted funds to strategically selected academics in American universities (as seen in this year’s allegations 12. R. Richard Geddes and Barry Strauss come down hard on American colleges who are suckling on the Beijing teat and providing cover for the brutal communist regime. Some need more than good advice to endure the pandemic, however. Mandated isolation can be an anxiety-provoking trial. To soften or avert a “social recession,” as former surgeon general Vivek Murthy recently called it in Under lockdown, basic mental hygiene will suffice for most: Get out of your pajamas each morning, keep a routine, and get ample sleep and exercise. Also connect, connect, and (virtually) connect with family and friends, and help others do the same. A bracing dose of Stoic philosophy is also in order, to remind us that “life is what our thoughts make of it,” as Marcus Aurelius understood.We need to think clearly about whose needs are best met by mental-health professionals and whose suffering should be “treated” in other ways.11. Sally Satel contends the disruption caused by the pandemic response may lead to a mental-health crisis, but offers sound advice to prevent a dire outcome. The IPCC makes no bones about viewing net zero, it says, as providing the opportunity for ‘intentional societal transformation.’ Limiting the rise to rise in global temperature to no more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels — an ill-defined baseline chosen by the UN because the Industrial Revolution is our civilization’s original sin — requires ‘transformative systemic change’ and ‘very ambitious, internationally cooperative policy environments that transform both supply and demand.’That timeline is now being used to bully American corporations into aligning their business strategies with the Paris agreement and force them to commit to eliminating greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. In fact, the text of the Paris agreement speaks of achieving a balance between anthropogenic sources and removals “in the second half of this century.” The net-zero target has no standing in American law or regulation. Net zero is not about a few tweaks here and there. It necessitates a top-down coercive revolution the likes of which have never been seen in any democracy. This is spelt out in the 10. Rupert Darwall attacks the Lefty-Green effort to bully American corporations into adopting the capitalism-killing Paris Agreement. Warren’s base, wine-track female voters, are As the past few months have made clear, Biden has won this argument in the minds of most Democratic voters. Despite his weak performances in the first three primary contests, he cruised to victory after victory, beginning in South Carolina, leaving both Warren and Sanders in the dust. In Warren’s home state of Massachusetts, Biden won with 33.6 percent of the vote. Warren took home the bronze trophy and 21.6 percent. Presidential-primary campaigns always include sniping between candidates, and often those candidates end up on a ticket together anyway. But why would Joe Biden — a 78-year-old man with significant health questions who won the Democratic nomination handily — select a former rival with a dearth of electoral accomplishments and a radically divergent outlook to serve as his vice president?9. And yeah, writes Isaac Schorr, Elizabeth Warren would be a terrible Veep pick. But Joe Biden is a Democrat and the liberal media are behaving much like Farquaad’s magic mirror, presenting their own binders full of women. A recent NBC report highlights the “unique strengths and weaknesses” of the ladies who might be picked. Insultingly, Stacy Abrams’s strengths are listed purely as things she cannot control: skin color, age, place of birth, etc. Her weaknesses, on the other hand, relate to experience and suitability: “Abrams’ highest level of government service was as the minority leader in Georgia’s state House,” and she “hasn’t been vetted nationally.” Amy Klobuchar, meanwhile, is described as “a proven winner in Minnesota,” yet is cast off as “unlikely to galvanize minority or progressive voters” on account of her being white. Biden’s policies on gender equality are even more embarrassingly superficial. This week, he pledged to cut funding to the U.S. Soccer Federation if women are not paid as much as their male counterparts.This strategy might be received differently if Joe Biden were a Republican. Readers of National Review will remember that moment when Mitt Romney, during a 2012 presidential debate, was asked by questioner in the audience how he planned to “rectify the inequalities in the workplace.” He answered that, as governor of Massachusetts, when he was looking to fill his cabinet, he made a concerted effort to find female applicants. He went to a number of women’s groups for suggestions, and they gave him “Biden needs not just A Woman, then, but a whole bunch of women who will abandon yesterday’s principles for today’s political convenience. Fortunately, the Democratic Party is full of such people. In a tweet, Reade wrote that “those who remain silent are complicit to rape” and tagged Ocasio-Cortez, Stacey Abrams, Kamala Harris, Tulsi Gabbard, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, and Michelle Obama. Perhaps one of them will be Biden’s vice president.8. Madeline Kearns explores the thinking behind Joe Biden’s “A Woman” veep commitment. There were some hiccups almost immediately: Early IHME estimates were of 100,000 to 200,000 deaths, but the number soon dropped to 80,000 and then even lower. As I The IHME model was meant to sidestep that issue. Rather than re-creating the underlying processes through which a disease spreads, it looked at what had actually happened in other countries during this pandemic. It “fit a curve” connecting trends in the U.S. with trends in other places, showing us where we’d end up if things worked out the same way as they had for those places.When modeling epidemics, scientists typically try to simulate the way a virus spreads: exponentially at first, because each infected person interacts with many other vulnerable individuals, and then slowing down as the population either gains immunity or takes deliberate steps to reduce transmission. This process can be modeled in very general terms, or by simulating the specific interactions and infections of millions of people as the Imperial College COVID-19 model does. Either way, the result’s utility is limited by the fact that researchers had to make a bunch of assumptions to arrive at it. Exactly how quickly does the disease spread when left unchecked? How much do people reduce their interactions when advised or legally required to practice social distancing? Which types of interactions are most dangerous? Different answers to these questions can yield very different modeling results.7. Robert VerBruggen has had it with the coronavirus modeling that would have trouble predicting if the sun will rise in the East tomorrow. Moreover, morale-driven press censorship was at least as extensive in Britain, France, and Germany in 1918 as it was in the United States. The reason why news came from Spain was precisely that Spain was neutral in the war. The lack of honest public reckoning with the pandemic was pervasive and hardly limited to the United States.<em>Second, </em>6. Dan McLaughlin provides a drubbing of Max Boot for his latest foolishness, this time for his excuse-mongering for the pandemic manufacturers in Beijing. As the pandemic abates, the U.S. and our allies should clearly and openly call out the abuses that China has perpetrated on the Western world since its admission to the WTO. The mantra of accommodation to China to mollify the PRC and slowly integrate them into existing global trade relationships has failed — or, more precisely, has worked for China but no one else. China’s leaders are repressive, they violate trade norms, and they steal intellectual property. They project hegemonic power wherever they can. We need to develop a partnership with American, European, and Asian businesses and governments to bring China’s exploitation to an end.How can American business and government oppose China’s outsized influence? One way is to create new supply chains and reinforce existing ones with U.S. allies in Asia, and in the Western Hemisphere and Europe. Chinese leaders do not think that our leaders and businesses have the resolve to accept higher costs in a less efficient supply chain for imported products, and we need to call their bluff. Policymakers should create new incentives for businesses to reorient supply chains away from China and disincentives for companies to invest there. A “sovereignty tax” on American investment in China, reflecting the value that U.S. companies derive from U.S. sovereignty but the damage they are doing to our strategic position by investing there, could be an example. It is worth incurring higher costs to be strategically secure.5. Congressman Frank Rooney says that the time to call out China for a myriad of abuses has been long a-coming. Throughout this crisis, there has been a litany of arrogance and ignorance. The FDA early on made a hubristic and disastrous decision to monopolize testing. Neither the WHO nor the CDC could get their stories straight on the wisdom or folly of wearing masks.Internet coronavirus-meters feign scientific accuracy with their hourly streams of precise data. But those without degrees wondered why such metrics even listed China, whose data is fanciful, or why the number of  “cases” is listed when it hinges entirely on the hit-and-miss and idiosyncratic testing of various states and nations.It seems a simple matter that the small number of those testing positive for the virus simply could not represent Unfortunately, in the present crisis, we have listened more to the university modeler than to a numbers-crunching accountant. The latter may not understand Banach manifolds, but he at least knows you cannot rely on basic equations and formulas if your denominator is inaccurate and your numerator is sometimes equally unreliable.4. The credentialed are having their day at the expense of those with common sense. Victor Davis Hanson challenges the wisdom of leaving the pandemic fight in the hands of the “experts.” Such an acknowledgment of the need to strike a balance between the economy and public health is now considered tantamount to murder.“The time needed for the Hammer,” it said, “is weeks, not months.” After that, it predicted, “our lives will go back close to normal.” And it contemplated living in a fuzzy realm of tradeoffs between important goals — or, as it put it, “a dance of measures between getting our lives back on track and spreading the disease, one of the economy vs. health care.”A viral It’s difficult to remember, but flattening the curve was never supposed to be about eradicating the disease. A piece by the progressive website 3. Rich Lowry goes after the lockdown fanatics. Cable-news networks really like covering a politician’s latest pronouncement and then having a roundtable of commentators argue about what he said. This is relatively cheap, easy, and quick. Donald Trump has been a godsend to cable news, because he’s always saying or tweeting something outrageous, and it is easy to find talking heads willing to declare his daily statements or actions the best or worst thing ever. American media institutions love stories about big personalities, and stories with binary conflicts, because those stories have an instinctual, visceral appeal for viewers.In short, this crisis has revealed that our largest and most influential media institutions are well-prepared to cover some stories but are barely able to cover others. Events in New York City, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles are covered the most, because the most media institutions are based there. Covering a story like the unprecedented disruptions to our food-supply chain requires 2. More MSM: Jim Geraghty hammers the Fifth Estate’s coronavirus failures. For starters, Ford was unable to offer a time or place or a single contemporaneous corroborating witness. Ford offered no evidence that she even knew Kavanaugh. Reade worked for Joe Biden. Reade has offered a specific time and place for the attack.One of the most egregious examples of revisionism can be found in a You can believe whomever you choose in the alleged sexual-misconduct cases of Joe Biden and Brett Kavanaugh, but you can’t revise history to erase your partisan double standards.1. David Harsanyi watches liberal hypocrites rewrite history as Tara Reade’s claims against Joe Biden upend #MeToo theology. <strong>A 20-Piece Maestro-Honchoed Orchestra Performing a Riveting Symphony of Conservative Brilliance (It Will Be Difficult, But Please: We Ask that You Refrain from Applauding until the Conclusion of the Program)</strong>Taking the police out of the equation invites abuse, from Lena Dunham’s Where police departments and prosecutors are negligent or incompetent, as they sometimes show themselves to be in these matters, then that is an occasion for reforming the police departments and prosecutors’ offices — not for handing over law-enforcement duties to professors and college administrators. Of course, victims of sexual assault may be uncomfortable talking to police and may find the prospect of doing so traumatic; universities can support these students with counseling and mental-health services, but colleges cannot substitute themselves for the criminal-justice system.And so DeVos is pushing in the right direction. But there is the deeper question of why campus proceedings are appropriate at all to handle matters of sexual assault, which is a serious crime and the business of police and prosecutors, not the business of deans of students who have no particular competency in prosecuting felonies or misdemeanors. If a college wants to maintain a policy of expelling students convicted of certain crimes (or policing lower-stakes violations of campus policies), then that is entirely reasonable. But seeing to that conviction is the business of the criminal-justice system, not the higher-education system. Sexual assault is not a matter of the campus honor code — it is a question of serious criminal misconduct.3. While Betsy DeVos feels the expected hate from liberal interests who decry due process on American campuses, we applaud her efforts to return a sense of justice where it is now AWOL. We very strongly suspect that having figures such as Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot bellowing at teenagers, “We will take you to jail — period” probably does more harm than good. The hectoring and bullying style that has too often accompanied the implementation of social distancing inspires more defiance than the rules themselves do. And such threats bring with them an obvious problem: Make good on them and you are endangering lives with the enforced closeness of arrest and jail; fail to make good on them and the credibility of local government is eroded. Best not to put yourself into such a bind to begin with. There will be some noncompliance, but a domineering approach is likely to make that problem worse rather than better.We would like to see scrupulous compliance with social-distancing practices. We also believe that people are more likely to accept the legitimacy of those rules when the decisions governing them are made in a way that is reasonable and democratic rather than unreasoning and autocratic, when decisions are made at the local level and respect the genuine diversity among our communities, and when those entrusted with the extraordinary authority of emergency powers are not themselves acting out of hysteria or in response to hysteria.Orange County is, in reality, faring better than much of California in the epidemic: As of this writing, it has suffered 52 COVID-19 deaths out of a population of more than 3 million, substantially fewer than nearby counties such as Riverside and San Bernardino, even though those have smaller populations. Orange County seems to have been doing reasonably well without any heavy-handed 2. Orange County, CA, needs a lockdown like Joe Biden needs plagiarism lessons. We say end the nutty restrictions. As Judge Klauser noted, both benefits and economic security have economic value, and the women’s team’s position “ignores the reality that the [men’s and women’s teams] bargained for different agreements which reflect different preferences, and that the [women’s team] explicitly rejected the terms they now seek to retroactively impose on themselves.” This is often true of the wider labor market, in which women tend – not always, but on average – to prefer jobs with more benefits and security, even when that may come at the expense of less cash or less opportunity for bonuses. Those are legitimate choices that should be respected.The women’s team turned down that deal, because they valued different things: guaranteed contracts, injury protection; health, dental, and vision insurance; child-care assistance; severance pay; guaranteed rest time. In short: more security and more benefits. True, they asked for the men’s deal Third, and most important, the women’s team made less money because they were offered the chance to play under the men’s contract terms and turned them down. This is where the case tells inconvenient truths about the labor market. The men’s team played under a “pay-to-play” contract, in which all the economic risk was borne by the players in exchange for more upside if the players made the team and the team was successful. The men’s team was not successful, so they made less money. Now, with no games being played, they are making no money at all, while the women are still getting paid.1. A federal judge blocks the kick of American women’s soccer egos. We cheer. <strong>Editorials</strong>Do read Andy’s brilliant 2019 book, To paper over this deficiency, Rosenstein issued the scope memo. Up until yesterday, we had been permitted to see only the Manafort-related passages (because, as just adumbrated, they became an issue in Mueller’s prosecution of Manafort). But as I noted at the time, even that glimpse of the memo provided insight into the travesty that was the Mueller appointment, and the Trump–Russia probe itself.The failure of Rosenstein’s order appointing Mueller to specify a proper foundation for a criminal probe was not just a public-perception problem for the Justice Department: It portended legal challenges. If Mueller charged anyone, as it appeared he was poised to do to Manafort (for tax and other crimes unrelated to Trump and Russia), the defense would surely claim that Mueller’s appointment was illegitimate.But the problem remained: There was no factual basis to believe that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, had engaged in a conspiracy with the Kremlin to interfere with the 2016 campaign by cyberespionage or any other criminal activity.Rosenstein agitated over being made the fall guy. In his hand-wringing over how to restore his reputation as a scrupulous nonpartisan (i.e., a nominally Republican bureaucrat admired by Democrats), he broached the possibilities of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove a mentally unfit president from office and of covertly recording the president in the Oval Office (if Trump ranted, recordings might convince the cabinet that he was unstable). Realizing that these were lunatic notions, Rosenstein finally settled on naming Mueller, a Beltway eminence, to be a special counsel. The appointment was made on May 17, with Rosenstein’s assurances to congressional Democrats that Mueller would have virtually boundless authority.Closer to home, at NRO, Andy commented on renewed attention paid to the partially redacted Rosenstein “Scope” Memo, the Ground Zero of this legal insanity. It’s well worth the read. General Flynn can never be made whole for the financial and emotional ruin wrought on him and his family over the last three years. But the prosecution’s decision to admit its case was baseless is better for Flynn than a pardon would have been. It is justice — too long delayed, but in the end not denied.With Flynn’s tireless new attorney, Sidney Powell, pressing for more discovery and pleading with the judge to throw the case out based on outrageous government misconduct, the ball was in the Justice Department’s court. On Thursday, DOJ did the right thing, dropping the case.The case was troubling enough that Attorney General Bill Barr appointed Our Andrew C. McCarthy knows a thing or two about federal prosecuting, and right after the news broke that the Justice Department was dropping its disgraceful case again General Michael Flynn, he penned Meanwhile, the tide turns, it comes high . . . and the sandcastles are getting washed away. How delicious this all is, to see a plot, actual and nefarious and contrived, flop, to see its game plan and perpetrators exposed, to watch the shameless media enablers — in large part the same cabal found contorting about Joe Biden allegations — unclutching their pearls just long enough to tweet hackneyed outrage, to project (“injustice!”) as cheeks crack and cataracts spout rage, to cry wolf yet again.Dear National ReviewFollow Us",0,Out Like Flynn

In the Golden State, it already takes over a month to resolve close elections as mail-in ballots trickle in days and weeks after Election Day. Putting what may be a supremely close presidential election into the hands of a U.S. Postal Service known for making mistakes sounds like a recipe for endless litigation and greatly increased distrust in our democracy.What should also spook voters who want an honest election is a report from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. It found that, in 2016, more mail ballots were misdirected to wrong addresses or unaccounted for than the number of votes separating Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. She led by 2.9 million votes, yet John Lieberman, a Democrat living in East Los Angeles, wrote in the The “I think it’s a huge deal,” she said. “Something is definitely wrong with the system.”  
   In California, the previous loosening of absentee ballot laws have sent disturbing signals. In 2016, a San Pedro couple found more than 80 unused ballots on top of their apartment-building mailbox. All had different names but were addressed to an 89-year-old neighbor who lives alone in their building. The couple suspected that someone was planning to pick up the ballots, but the couple had intercepted them first. In the same election, a Gardena woman told the   
   In Wisconsin recently, officials held that state’s April primary election in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis. Voters who did not want to vote in-person, including the elderly, could vote by absentee ballot. But hundreds of thousands of people cast ballots at in-person locations, and overall turnout was high. Officials speculated that a few virus cases “may” have been related to Election Day, but, as AP reported, they couldn’t confirm that the patients “definitely got [COVID-19] at the polls.”Even assuming that the coronavirus remains a serious health issue in November, there is no reason to abandon in-person voting. A new Heritage Foundation report by Hans von Spakovsky and Christian Adams notes that in 2014, the African nation of Texas has a long history of intimidation and coercion involving absentee ballots. The abuse of elderly voters is so pervasive that Indeed. In 2018, a political consultant named Leslie McCrae Dowless and seven others were indicted on charges of “scheming to illegally collect, fill in, forge and submit mail-in ballots” to benefit Republican congressional candidate Mark Harris, the That remains true today. In 2012, a Miami–Dade County Grand Jury issued a public report recommending that Florida change its law to prohibit “ballot harvesting” unless the ballots are “those of the voter and members of the voter’s immediate family.” “Once that ballot is out of the hands of the elector, we have no idea what happens to it,” they pointed out. “The possibilities are numerous and scary.”Experts have long cautioned against wholesale use of mail ballots, which are cast outside the scrutiny of election officials. “Absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud,” was the conclusion of the bipartisan 2005 Commission on Federal Election Reform, chaired by former president Jimmy Carter and former secretary of state James Baker.Just last January, the public-interest law firm Judicial Watch reached a settlement agreement with the State of California and L.A.

Los Angeles County (population 10 million) has a registration rate of If liberals can’t mandate vote-by-mail nationally, they will demand that states take the lead. Last Friday, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, signed an executive order requiring that every registered voter — including those listed as “inactive” — be mailed a ballot this November.But liberals see a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to sweep away the current system. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted that a mandatory national vote-by-mail option be forced on states in the first Coronavirus aid bill. She retreated only when she was ridiculed for shamelessly using the bill to push a political agenda. But Pelosi has promised her Democratic caucus that she will press again to overhaul election laws in the next aid bill.The ideas Holder and others are proposing include requiring that a mail-in ballot be automatically sent to every voter, which would allow people to both register and vote on Election Day. It would also permit “ballot harvesting,” whereby political operatives go door-to-door collecting ballots that they then deliver to election officials. All of these would dramatically reduce safeguards protecting election integrity.“Coronavirus gives us an opportunity to revamp our electoral system,” Obama’s former attorney general, Eric Holder, recently told <span class=""drop"">E</span>

No charge.Finally, if there was some sort of hazardous event that made everyone leave the “high security portion” of the Wuhan Institute of Virology in October, that event may have been driven by something hazardous that was completely different from SARS-CoV-2. That said, if the WIV had a separate, unrelated, serious accident in October, it would be further evidence to refute the never-that-plausible “the Chinese researchers were simply too diligent and professional to ever have an accidental release of a virus from their facilities” argument.The French case is somewhat disruptive to the timeline of previously-known cases, but not by a lot. The French patient’s samples were collected at a hospital on December 27, but he was not initially tested for SARS-CoV-2. (Almost no one had heard of it then.) Doctors recently went back and retested his sample and now believe he was infected with the virus between December 14 and 22. What’s particularly intriguing is this patient had not returned from China or anywhere abroad, although “the patient’s wife worked at a supermarket near Charles de Gaulle airport and could have come into contact with people who had recently arrived from China.” By December 21, Wuhan doctors begin to notice a “The November 17 date comes from an unnamed source showing aThe time period of the lack of cell phone activity is a little early in light of what we know about the outbreak, but not by a great deal.

The bigger the drop, the more significant this is — and less likely it was driven by something like the bosses yelling at their employees for spending too much time on their phones at work or something. It is also fair to wonder how complete this cellphone location data is.It offers no direct evidence of a shutdown, or any proof for the theory that the virus emerged accidentally from the lab.The report — obtained by the London-based NBC News Verification Unit — says there was no cellphone activity in a high-security portion of the Wuhan Institute of Virology from Oct. 7 through Oct. 24, 2019, and that there may have been a “hazardous event” sometime between Oct. 6 and Oct. 11.A private analysis of cellphone location data purports to show that a high-security Wuhan laboratory studying coronaviruses shut down in October, three sources briefed on the matter told NBC News.

In order to prevent this from happening, the U.S. must provide a full-throated defense of Taiwan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Now is the time for a declaratory statement of policy committing the United States to the defense of Taiwan. While this approach is not without risk, as we have learned painfully from decades of failed policy toward the CCP, the greatest risk of all comes from complacency.But just as Taiwan’s very existence calls into question the CCP’s legitimacy, so too would the invasion, absorption, or coercion of a democratic partner call into question the seriousness of American defense commitments. Regional allies such as Japan and Australia would nervously ask themselves whether they too would be abandoned under the wrong circumstances. By taking Taiwan, the People’s Liberation Army Navy would have a foothold to turn Japan’s flank and break out of the first island chain, adding Taiwan’s numerous foundries to China’s and gaining a near-monopoly on global microelectronics production in the process.Regardless of how that vote turns out, it is time to end our policy of strategic ambiguity with Taiwan, because there is nothing ambiguous about the CCP’s designs on Taiwan. As Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Pottinger outlined in a Building on this momentum and coming out of the coronavirus crisis, the U.S. should go farther by establishing a multinational COVID-19 task force in Taipei with U.S. scientific and diplomatic participation. When conditions permit, Secretary Pompeo could visit Taipei to give an address at the new American Institute in Taiwan on Taiwan’s role in helping humanity see through the CCP’s lies and defeat the coronavirus. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to demonstrate resolve and strengthen our relationship with Taiwan. In 2018, Congress passed the Taiwan Travel Act, making it U.S. policy to allow high-level meetings between U.S. and Taiwanese government officials, including military officers. Earlier this spring, President Trump signed the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act, which authorizes the State Department to pursue both carrots and sticks for countries that strengthen or weaken relations with Taiwan. The Trump administration has also regularized and increased arms sales to Taiwan, providing them with F-16s to modernize their aging air force.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Yet while Taiwan has embraced restrained, responsible statecraft, Beijing has poached Taiwan’s diplomatic allies, used economic leverage to punish Taipei, and engaged in dangerous military provocations with growing frequency. At a broader level, the cross-strait balance of power has shifted in Beijing’s favor thanks to a rapid rise in military spending, and General Secretary Xi Jinping has made clear his intent to annex Taiwan by whatever means necessary. The Chinese military threat to Taiwan is no longer a long-term hypothetical scenario. Rather, it is a dangerous course of action that gets more likely the less we stand up to CCP aggression.Unfortunately, support for Taiwan has been inconsistent. Unlike NATO’s crystal-clear Article V collective-defense commitment, the U.S. commitment to Taiwan has been muddled. Since the Carter administration, the United States has adopted a policy of “strategic ambiguity.” Once upon a time, proponents of this strategy may have told themselves that they were calming tensions by deterring It’s hard to have a more high-quality friend than Taiwan — a vibrant democracy under intense pressure that deserves our full support.The CCP’s contributions to the pandemic have inspired legislation holding the CCP <span class=""drop"">L</span>

As If herd immunity to the SARS-Cov-2 virus is possible, at what point would it be achieved? “Let’s say there’s a component of folks who are sort of naturally immune for whatever reason that we don’t understand.

When a story like this virus and China come along, they can only perceive the events through that preexisting lens.You’ve probably heard about that restaurant in Colorado that was open and crowded on Mother’s Day. You’ve probably heard about the president and vice president not wearing masks. You may have heard about Twitter establishing new rules to fight disinformation about the coronavirus — but you probably haven’t heard My guess is that unless you’re making a deliberate effort to keep up with news out of China, you haven’t heard much about any of these developments.With consequences as fast and dire as that, do you think any Chinese scientist is going to admit, “yes, mistakes happen, and this virus could have been one of ours”?I can understand why a Chinese scientist would insist a laboratory mistake is impossible. Zhang Xuezhong, a prominent Chinese legal scholar, argued on social media that restrictions on freedom of expression had made it more difficult for the country to contain the outbreak, and criticized the Chinese government’s arrest and suppression of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang. He Notice that the Chinese authorities want to blur the line between “occurred naturally in wildlife” and “laboratory escape.” You can take naturally occurring viruses into a lab, either as part of a sample or as part of a research animal, and then that virus can get out of that lab — either through the accidental infection of a lab worker, or through the improper disposal of biological material. This literally happened twice separately with SARS in a laboratory in Beijing in 2004.Finally, elsewhere in China, a new study out of the Shandong First Medical University concludes, “<strong>Trust Only Those Who Get Arrested</strong>Does this county look stable to you? Or does China look like a powder keg, with a lot of angry people who have a whole lot of good reasons to be angry? And does the government in Beijing look like a bunch of strategic masterminds, or do they look like they have only one play in their playbook: attempting to steer public anger into angry nationalism, over and over and over again?Does the Chinese government look and sound like a group of leaders that are confident that they are winning the battle of world opinion? They’re Suga has been Abe’s right-hand man and a key player in his government since Abe returned as prime minister in 2012. Suga’s remarks reflect something much broader than a temporary policy response to the current crisis.“Looking at masks, for example, 70% to 80% are produced in China,” he said. “We must avoid depending excessively on particular countries for products or materials and bring home production facilities for goods needed for daily life.”Yet, the argument gained new life again when Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, in an interview with Nikkei, stressed the need for greater self-reliance.Though the amount made up less than 1% of the 108 trillion yen coronavirus stimulus package, it clearly put China on guard. Beijing not only pressed Japanese authorities to explain the meaning of the measure, but also polled Japanese businesses in China on whether they planned to leave.Japan’s cabinet in April earmarked 248.6 billion yen ($2.33 billion) for subsidies to businesses that move production back to Japan, covering up to two-thirds of relocation costs.Meanwhile, the United States isn’t the only <strong>Nobody Wants to Be Dependent upon Chinese Imports Anymore</strong>Chinese movie Does this sound like a country that has had only a handful of cases in the past ten weeks?There is “no chance” that the coronavirus pandemic will end soon, and countries must prepare for a “new normal” amid plans to reopen, said Zhang Wenhong, head of the infectious diseases department of Huashan Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai and director of the city’s COVID-19 clinical expert team.But access to testing has been uneven. While big cities including Beijing, Guangdong and the epicenter Wuhan have greatly expanded capacity and allowed residents to take tests as they wish, people in remote areas such as Heilongjiang still face difficulties.Statistics from Dongxing Securities showed that in normal operation, medical institutions in China could test a total of 1.66 million people a day, matching the basic needs of massive testing as social activities resume.As of Friday, the national drug regulator approved 30 testing kits for the virus, including 19 nucleic acid tests and 11 antibody tests. The combined manufacturing capacity of testing kits surpassed 9 million a day, according to the National Medical Products Administration.Notice this article that originally appeared in the For a long time in the Soviet Union, understanding what was really going on We know the Chinese national and Wuhan local authorities never like admitting bad news unless they have to, and when they do admit bad news, it is likely drastically understated.And it’s not just Wuhan again: “Or maybe not: “China also contends that it has had only a handful of new cases in a country of more than a billion people in March, April, and so far in May, and only one death since April 17. As far as the Chinese government is telling the world, they have the coronavirus beaten once and for all.(If you’re wondering about those 21 million cell phone subscriptions that disappeared, Chinese cell phone companies Back in mid-April, Wuhan health officials revised their local death toll from 2,579 to 3,869. One-half of the previous total is 1,289.5; the increase was 1,290 — almost as if someone arbitrarily decided to raise the existing death toll by fifty percent.There is widespread consensus outside of China that whatever the actual tally of coronavirus deaths in that country was, the sum was significantly higher than the officially released numbers.

A recent Given the employment picture for the less educated, any program that brings in unskilled workers is particularly nonsensical. The president should, for example, immediately suspend the H-2B program that brings in unskilled workers for nonagricultural jobs. He should also suspend those parts of the J-1 program that bring in lower-cost workers who are tied to the employer, which is the primary reason so many businesses like these programs.In addition to the 1 million green cards given out each year, before the COVID-19 shutdown the State Department issued roughly 
Now, with 23 million unemployed, the extremely weak argument for most employment-based green cards and guest-worker programs has entirely evaporated. Among those 25 and older, almost The primary argument for employment-based permanent immigration and guest workers has been that there is a shortage of workers. Of course, it was never clear that workers were actually in short supply. Many studies, including by the Economic theory predicts that by increasing the supply of workers, immigration will have a negative impact on the wages and employment of some American workers. There is Our immigration system consists of permanent immigration (green cards) and temporary immigration, both long-term and short-term. The permanent system brings in about 1 million annually, mostly sponsored by their relatives in this country, or workers sponsored by employers. We also give out green cards based on a lottery, and there are refugees and asylum seekers. All of these 1 million green cards each year come with lifetime work authorization. Long-term temporary immigration, in contrast to tourists, is primarily composed of guest workers, all of whom can work, and foreign students, who also often are allowed to work.<span class=""drop"">W</span>

But I’ve never claimed to be great at reading the political winds.The current provision doesn’t expire until the end of July, and there are Earlier this year, Congress passed very generous unemployment benefits for people who are thrown out of work by COVID-19. Indeed, these benefits are sometimes higher than what recipients made while working. It’s one thing to do that when you   3. My own take: We’re using a lot of federal money to help entities, public and private alike, that have been directly affected by the pandemic, and there’s no obvious reason that USPS should be shut out entirely. USPS, which of course trafficks heavily in paper communications, saw a lot of revenue disappear with the arrival of the Internet — and this loss reverberated. For example, its retirement health benefits long worked on a ‘pay-as-you-go’ basis, meaning that former workers’ benefits were paid for out of current revenues. This doesn’t work when revenues are evaporating and retiree health costs are rising, so in 2006 Congress Like the urban blue states, USPS faced a dire situation even before COVID-19 struck and then suffered a severe blow from the virus itself. It’s reporting a one-third decline in mail volume (though there are 2.With many Republicans, including the president, expressing reticence to bail out blue states, with some blue states on the brink of fiscal disaster, and with Illustrating the difficulty of settling on a fair approach, the House Democrats’ bill divides the states’ money into numerous bins, each of which relies on a The answer will affect what coalition you can put together to pass a bill, and it will change whether the aid heads disproportionately to GOP or Democratic strongholds. Some ways of structuring this aid could also discourage states from reopening by promising federal aid to offset the damage of extended lockdowns.
The tensions over whether and how to help states are entirely predictable. The states most desperately in need of aid are dense blue ones, which were hit hardest by the virus but also did the worst job managing their pensions. Even if you start with the assumption that a bailout of some kind is justified, there’s no great way to dole it out. Does it go to the states with the most financial need? The most COVID-19 deaths? Or what?This is the big one. COVID-19 has torpedoed tax revenues and increased reliance on safety-net programs, wreaking havoc on state finances. “Rainy day” funds are running dry, and previous relief bills didn’t give much to states. It doesn’t help that so many states dug themselves into a hole long before the virus attacked by mismanaging their pension funds.1. But once the feeding trough is open, everyone lines up, and Congress has to choose who gets what.

   Thus,   
   Wilder’s view of personal and social corruption falls short of the Shakespearean complexity in Orson Welles’s <em>Ace in the Hole</em>Wilder’s dullest scenes feature a moralizing editor named Boot lecturing Tatum about ethics. He’s a drudge opposite Douglas’s electrifying exhibitionism and its ugly, opportunistic reality: the moment Tatum ensnares a corrupt sheriff, warning, “You play along with me and I’ll have you reelected. If you don’t, I’ll crucify you!” However, that threat has no imaginable equivalent among today’s journalists who collude with political power in the interest of progressive social engineering.Could Wilder, who left Nazi Germany as a principled, life-saving moral choice before he became a Hollywood heavyweight, conceive the arrogance we see in the out-of-control White House Press corps who are held accountable only by the president they assail? Wilder makes Tatum a scapegoat for the media’s sins and isolates that threat in a single man because he naïvely believed in the integrity of the press (along with the notion of a solitary Hitlerian fiend).Douglas’s Tatum personifies what Brendan O’Neill calls the “political infantilism of the Left.” Tatum claims, “I don’t make things happen. I only write about them.” Now, when journalists claim that their job is to “hold public officials accountable,” it’s the same humble-brag, shrugging off moral responsibility and hiding partisanship while demonstrating the boastful habit of activist-journalist narcissism.So when Wilder uses Tatum’s smartness against him, he also uses the movie against us. Smart-ass cynicism, an irresistible card trick based on the sense of superiority felt by many crusading journalists — and attention-grabbers who call themselves journalists — also tricks moviegoers who relish the opportunity for easy umbrage. That’s the problem with Wilder’s moralizing movies from But Tatum’s type is not just legion. These days it’s celebrated — perverting the investigative-reporter ideal into gotcha journalism, in which reporters pursue the fame that Watergate brought to the egoistic Woodward and Bernstein, thus creating an aberrant media class.
Reviewers, which is to say, second-tier journos, love Our identification with Tatum’s temperament and drive becomes more repugnant as the story develops. Tatum’s journalist careerism is like poker strategy. He keeps his “ace,” a Mexican-Catholic trading-post owner, trapped in a cave that collapsed when he was robbing artifacts from a Native American burial site. He plans to build curiosity for the grand, human-interest rescue story he stokes in the press.Wilder, best known for Ironically, <span class=""drop"">B</span>

Among them:We don’t like hearing that we need to eat healthier and exercise more. We don’t like hearing that we have to save more and spend less. We don’t like being reminded that The Fauci approach — “tell the truth, whether or not people want to hear it” — is only half the challenge. The other half is getting people to Politicians, however, do care a great deal about what the public wants to hear. And year by year, decade by decade, our electorate has shown very little patience for any lawmaker that tells the public hard truths that it would rather not hear. We don’t like hearing that we’re spending more money that we’re taking in, and that interest payments on our debt will grow larger and larger in the future. We don’t like to hear that Fauci’s job is to tell us the truth, as best he can determine, in his medical judgment. His job isn’t to sugarcoat it or make the truth easier to hear or bear. Fauci’s job is not to be popular. He’s not up for reelection. While he would probably prefer to not leave the American public with a sense of despair, he’s not obligated to try to make us feel better about what the truth is. To paraphrase a wise not-so-old philosopher, his facts don’t care about our feelings.Yesterday’s Senate hearing featuring Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had a <strong>Doctors and Politicians Do Not Have the Same Incentives</strong>We thought South Korea was showing us the better way and were ahead of us — but they just had a What’s more, no one in any position of authority seems to know when things will go “back to normal.” I suspect that’s what’s really frightening Americans. We can endure a lot, as long as we know there’s an end date, a light at the end of the tunnel.The coronavirus pandemic is the first problem in American life in a long time that has affected the life of just about everyone. It is the first crisis in a long time that people from coast to coast cannot choose to ignore. Your local hospital canceled your nonessential visit. Your employer laid you off or furloughed you. You cannot visit your elderly relative in a nursing home. Businesses around you are closed — other than your supermarket and pharmacy. The shelves in your store may not have had toilet paper a few weeks ago — or meat now. Your local restaurants are either now only take-out and delivery or have shut down entirely. Your locality may be requiring you to wear a mask, and you’re not allowed to gather in groups. Every major event and gathering is canceled. Your children’s school is closed.But now . . . things are not turning out okay.Even our worst natural disasters — such as Hurricane Katrina — only affected one region of the country at once. The 9/11 attacks were absolutely horrific and terrifying, but most of America outside of New York and Washington managed to return to something resembling “normal” daily routines pretty quickly. The Great Recession was painful and slow, but even at its worst, about 90 percent of the workforce kept going to work, the schools remained open, and food was on the shelves. Things that seem like a big deal to those of us who follow the news closely — For a long time in American life, most people could look at the news most days, shrug, and say “Eh, this is much ado about nothing, things will turn out okay.”We’ve all been forced to accept and adapt to some hard truths — maybe even once unthinkable ones. As of this writing, the American death toll is above 83,000 and we’re approaching 300,000 deaths worldwide.

More importantly, every study except two finds a negative relationship between high levels of government debt and economic growth. This is true even for studies that find no common threshold. The empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports the view that a large amount of government debt has a negative impact on economic growth potential, and in many cases that impact gets more pronounced as debt increases. The current fiscal trajectory of the United States means that in the coming 30-year period, the effects of a large and growing public debt ratio on economic growth could amount to a loss of $4 trillion or $5 trillion in real GDP, or as much as $13,000 per capita, by 2049.As a reminder, in a new paper, Jack Salmon and I review <span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Large fiscal expenditures, as well as more loans by households and firms, will lead to sharp increases in public and private debt in the near future.

So why is our “nationalist” president still sticking with this trade agreement? Why can’t he criticize the Chinese government?Trump’s supporters might plausibly claim that his reluctance to more forcefully attack Xi’s regime in public comes from a desire to preserve the trade deal he negotiated. They’d have a much harder time arguing that the trade deal is actually a desirable outcome for the U.S. All in all, Trump’s administration deep-sixed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have put more pressure on China, then engaged in a short, inconclusive series of trade skirmishes with China that did nothing to repatriate industry to the U.S., and then announced the trade deal while giving Xi a tongue bath.<script async="""" charset=""utf-8"" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script>— Donald J.

Terrific working with President Xi, a man who truly loves his country. Much more to come!Unfortunately, the key word there is “ostensible.” As is the case on so many issues, Trump is not as tough on China as he’d like everyone to think. Yes, he initiated a U.S.–China “trade war” aimed at reining in Beijing’s economic malfeasance, but he has steadfastly refused to bring up any ancillary issues about the human-rights abuses in Xinjiang or the political abuses in Hong Kong. Yes, he signed a bill aimed at pushing back on the latter abuses after it passed Congress with overwhelming, bipartisan support, but his secretary of state has now delayed its implementation. Yes, he’s called COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” and bragged about his travel ban on China. But his administration somehow let Which brings us to Donald Trump. Trump was elected in no small part because of his opposition to immigration and globalization. He asked who really benefited from these phenomena, and proposed doing something about them. China, as a Communist nation that profits remora-like from the global market that it didn’t build and doesn’t defend or respect, was prominent on his ostensible list of targets, and continued to be after he took office.

Fifty-one percent said they approve of his recent decision to let some businesses decide whether to reopen, while 47 percent disagreed. A larger majority (58 percent) supports Kemp’s decision to lift the stay-at-home order and keep precautions in place for more vulnerable members of the population, especially those in nursing homes. Thirty-eight percent said they strongly approve of this, while 41 percent disapprove.Meanwhile, the race for the open seat is complicated by Doug Collins, a Republican congressman from Georgia’s ninth district, who is challenging Loeffler for the GOP nod. In the poll, Collins leads with 19 percent, followed by Loeffler at 18 percent, and Democratic candidate Matt Lieberman at 17 percent. This race has a lot more voter uncertainty than Perdue’s: Twenty-six percent of respondents said they remain undecided.The new poll found that Perdue is leading one of his possible Democratic opponents Jon Ossoff, by a small margin, 43 percent to 41 percent.

Eight percent of respondents said they are undecided.Georgia will feature two Senate elections this year. In one, Republican incumbent David Perdue is running for reelection and his Democratic opponent will be chosen in a primary on June 9. In the other, candidates are running in a special election to fill the seat that previously belonged to retiring Republican senator Johnny Isakson. That seat is currently occupied by Republican Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed by Georgia’s GOP governor Brian Kemp to fill the spot until the special election.According to the group’s summary of the results, 46 percent of respondents said they support Trump, while 47 percent back Biden.

Looked at in detail and minute by minute, it won’t be pretty. There will be hysterical critics of this gradual reopening, just as there have been of the shutdowns. And they will be right in part, just as the shutdown’s critics surely have been. But I think they’ll be wrong on the whole, just as the shutdown’s critics have been. And if our elected officials think so too, they have to act on that sense, begin to fumble toward reopening, and do the best they can to navigate the choppy waters ahead.All of this will need to happen alongside the effort to revive the economy, which will need to include further legislative measures to deliver assistance to states, businesses, and workers. Reopening won’t mean a roaring return of the economy. People are scared and need to build trust in a new environment. Economic arrangements have been disrupted and need to be reconstructed. That will take time and trial and error. And public-health and economic support will have to work together to enable recovery.We also need to invest in building some sense of the geography and demography of any outbreak. It will be hard to do that quickly—it can take a month and more from a first batch of new cases until the shape of a genuine new outbreak becomes apparent in the data. That means reopening will involve some serious mistakes and setbacks to which local leaders will need to respond.It will also mean emphasizing a strategy of separating the sick from the healthy whenever possible, which has not really been our way of thinking about this pandemic so far. And it will mean special emphasis on dealing with the riskiest settings: nursing homes, factories, prisons, and other high-exposure facilities. We have completely and catastrophically lacked a strategy for dealing with such settings, and that needs to change.Such a move doesn’t mean, however, that we now need to focus on economic challenges to the exclusion of public-health ones. On the contrary. To be sustainable, the gradual reopening of the economy will need to be accompanied by strenuous efforts to keep the public-health crisis at bay. That will mean, to begin with, further expanding our testing capacity to keep track of the spread. It’s probably not reasonable to set specific numerical targets on this front; we just need a directional target: We need None of that is to say that starting to open up the economy won’t bring more infections, only that we are somewhat better equipped to contain and address those. The shutdowns involved a heavy and difficult tradeoff. The gradual reopening will too. But we are nearing the point, in many places, where on balance the latter tradeoff begins to make more sense than the former. The economic costs of the shutdowns have been growing as their public-health benefits have been diminishing. That suggests the shutdowns have been useful, not that they were a mistake. But it also suggests that it is time to move forward.But it still makes sense to begin a new phase relatively soon. Hospitalizations are at manageable levels in most places. And people have built up habits in the course of this shutdown—habits we simply didn’t have before—that look reasonably likely to help contain the spread some. We will wear masks and keep our distance. We will wash hands and keep our hands off surfaces. We won’t jump into crowds. We’re also ramping up testing considerably, even if widespread contact tracing remains beyond reach. And we’re going to ramp up economic and social activity slowly. Government restrictions will be lifted only gradually, and people’s own behavior will ease up even more gradually than that.This isn’t happening in the clean way that the various official and unofficial guidelines would have preferred. It now doesn’t seem likely that various jurisdictions will wait to see 14 days of declining caseloads before entering a new phase, for instance. This is in part because we have succeeded in slowing the virus so that many places have reached plateaus in caseloads that aren’t likely to start declining continuously, and it’s in part because the economic costs of mitigation strategies are proving untenable.Its first phase has essentially succeeded: Americans proved remarkably willing to put their lives on hold and make very painful economic sacrifices to avert a catastrophic overwhelming of the health system. That catastrophe does appear to have been averted, even in the hardest-hit places. And the time is coming to gradually ratchet up economic activity while trying to mitigate the risk of increased transmission of the virus to the extent possible. The shutdown has been necessary and appropriate. But it is also necessary and appropriate now to start the return and seek that sustainable way to live with the virus until it can be beaten.Now that all makes it sound like our response has run aground. And yet I don’t think that’s quite right. When you step back and take a broader view of where we stand, the general outlines of a plausible way forward aren’t that hard to see. If, say, two months ago you had asked yourself how we should try to respond to the crisis, you might have argued (But what will most directly force Congress to act is probably the dire fiscal situation of the states. State needs are keenly felt by senators and representatives, they tend to cut across party lines, and they are increasingly urgent. Some Republicans still think they can ignore them, while Democrats think that expanding federal welfare programs and throwing money at high-tax states is the way forward. I suspect they will need to end up somewhere else—Maybe they’re right. Or maybe they just can’t do better. But I suspect both parties will be thinking differently by the end of May. It is simply much too soon to be talking about the crisis in the past tense, however much we may want to. The depths of the economic calamity we face are only starting to become apparent, and the public-health crisis itself is far from dealt with.Senate Republicans are now talking about a pause in legislative action. They also reasoned (or at least Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did) that letting any new relief bill originate in the House would give Senate Republicans leverage to make demands against it, rather than having to accede to Democratic demands against a Republican bill. For the moment, it doesn’t seem like things are going to work that way, precisely because of the Democratic reversion to reflex: The bill that House Democrats unveiled this week is a ridiculous sham, directed to the management of the internal dynamics of the House Democratic caucus and not to the needs of a country facing immense public-health and economic challenges. It can’t readily serve as the foundation for actual legislation in this moment. It suggests the Democratic leadership, like the Republican leadership, doesn’t think another bill is necessary just now.A further reason for a lack of momentum is a kind of reversion to political instincts and reflexes among both parties in Congress. For Republicans, that means a reversion to skepticism about the need for any action. For Democrats, it means a reversion to a decades-old to-do list rooted in mid-20th-century social-democratic dreams more than in any engagement with the realities of 21st-century America.If you look at the fine details, and do it minute by minute, you’d have to say we’re in a period of diminished momentum and loss of focus. One reason for that is that the failure of planning at the top means we don’t live with a consistent sense of what our government’s strategy is, and are thrown around by daily events. The point of contingency and response planning in government isn’t the plans that result but the capacity to take in the big picture and think about strategic aims. (As Dwight Eisenhower put it, “plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.”) Even now, there appears to be no such planning process, and therefore no relief from the news cycle. This White House isn’t going to improve on that front. What you see has always been what you get with Donald Trump, and what you see is not a man capable of rising to a crisis like this. He is decisively overmatched. That’s not the end of the world, but it’s a problem for the country.Where do things stand now in our public response to the Covid-19 pandemic?National ReviewFollow Us",0,Fumbling Toward Reopening

Chris Bollwage, the mayor of Elizabeth, N.J., defended his city’s use of drones in an interview with MSNBC in mid April.“With more front-line workers testing positive for COVID-19, our focus is giving our public safety professionals every tool possible to fight the virus and protect citizens.

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.Public officials need to consider risks to life and health in deciding what to reopen, when, and how. Pro-life public officials should take very seriously the risk that the wrong choices will lead to more deaths, and they should weigh that more heavily than any other factor. But pro-lifers are in no way required to shut their eyes to all other forms of human life and need, or to shut the country just to prove a point.The same is true of evaluations of the relative risk to older and younger people. Being pro-life means you reject the view that Grandma should be unplugged because she’s old. But it does not mean that you close your eyes to the stubborn reality that we all die, and we all run more risk of death as we age. We can accept Indeed, it is only in our modern age — since the discovery of penicillin in 1928 — that it is even possible to consider living without constant fear of infectious disease. Societies before us took steps, sometimes harsh ones, to fight disease, but they never just stopped living for fear of dying. Pro-life has a real meaning when it comes to the prohibition on deliberate taking of lives, but it has never meant that we cannot also be pro-living when it comes to accepting a certain level of risk, and trusting in the Lord or to chance. The idea that weighing life against living is forbidden to pro-lifers is simply a failure to understand that crucial distinction.  
   Weighing economic and social factors in reopening decisions is something everyone does anyway, whether or not they are willing to admit it. Why hasn’t the New York City subway shut down completely, given its outsized role as a vector for disease? Mainly because some people need it to get to work to make a living. Guess what? Lots of people need to get to work to make a living, even people who do not take subways. That does not mean we impose no restrictions on anyone; it does mean that everybody’s analysis of the question already includes those kinds of considerations.Proportionality, when applied to big questions of social policy and probability, includes not only life but   
   On the question of what constitutes “proportionate reasons” for reopening businesses, churches, and other core institutions of the economy and civil society, there are also serious tradeoffs to weigh on the other side — tradeoffs that are themselves subject to all the same uncertainties. We know that prolonging lockdowns is likely to lead to damage to the economy, which in turn means more poverty, more unemployment and dependence that saps human dignity, and fewer social resources to alleviate suffering. We know that prolonging lockdowns is likely to exacerbate other problems: deaths from suicide and addiction, domestic abuse, missed diagnoses of other life-threatening diseases. We know these things, but we can only estimate their size to compare them with other estimates of lives lost.The actual results are probably less optimistic than that, given the lags that exist in reporting data on a daily basis, but a spike in deaths large enough to amount to “human sacrifice” would be pretty hard to hide in that data. The lesson for all of us should be a little more humility in making sweeping claims about what we know will happen. Our philosophical framework for distinguishing between direct killing and probability is not just some sort of moral smokescreen; it reflects our long human experience with uncertainty. Abortion or euthanasia, by contrast, involves no uncertainty: The end of life is the point.<img alt="""" class=""size-full wp-image-810848 aligncenter"" data-image-id=""810848"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" height=""629"" loading=""lazy"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Deaths-May-13-2020.jpg?resize=600%2C629&amp;ssl=1"" srcset=""https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Deaths-May-13-2020.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Deaths-May-13-2020.jpg?resize=286%2C300&amp;ssl=1 286w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Deaths-May-13-2020.jpg?resize=459%2C481&amp;ssl=1 459w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Deaths-May-13-2020.jpg?resize=439%2C460&amp;ssl=1 439w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Deaths-May-13-2020.jpg?resize=549%2C576&amp;ssl=1 549w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Deaths-May-13-2020.jpg?resize=48%2C50&amp;ssl=1 48w"" width=""600""/><img alt="""" class=""size-full wp-image-810849 aligncenter"" data-image-id=""810849"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" height=""698"" loading=""lazy"" sizes=""(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"" src=""https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Cases-May-13-2020.jpg?resize=600%2C698&amp;ssl=1"" srcset=""https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Cases-May-13-2020.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Cases-May-13-2020.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Cases-May-13-2020.jpg?resize=459%2C534&amp;ssl=1 459w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Cases-May-13-2020.jpg?resize=395%2C460&amp;ssl=1 395w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Cases-May-13-2020.jpg?resize=495%2C576&amp;ssl=1 495w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Georgia-Coronavirus-Cases-May-13-2020.jpg?resize=43%2C50&amp;ssl=1 43w"" width=""600""/>A little over two weeks ago, when Georgia governor Brian Kemp decided to begin reopening parts of the state’s economy, Amanda Mull of <strong><em>The Things We Know and the Things We Choose<br/>

To the pro-lifer, looking at a particular person and taking their life away — actively, or by refusing life-or-death assistance — is a deliberate choice that is different in a morally meaningful way from simply adopting this or that public policy that is statistically projected to increase risks of death. This distinction has a long pedigree in Western philosophy and Christian theology. It tends to get hand-waved away by progressives who reject both, but rejecting other people’s premises does not make them hypocritical.Taken together, this is a philosophy that treats every human life as sacred and imposes a stern burden of justification for the taking of life. But it also draws lines to allow for real-world distinctions. Deliberately taking a life is different from accepting the “inability to impede” death, which is the natural end of all life. It is different from actions that are expected to lead to deaths as a matter of probability. It matters if actions that aren’t intended to cause death are justified, but justification demands “proportionate reasons.”(Emphasis, in all cases, in original.)The Catechism emphasizes that the Fifth Commandment (“Thou Shalt Not Kill”) “forbids Consider, as an example of pro-life reasoning, <strong><em>What “Pro-Life” Means<br/>

No charge.Biden does appear to be the favorite at the moment; he is, after all, leading in nationwide polls by an average of 4.5 percent, according to <span>NOW WATCH: </span>I don’t want to spin this poll as great news for President Trump — he has a 55 percent disapproval rating, and only 36 percent think he’s a trustworthy source of information about the crisis — but the story of the 21st century has been persistently low faith in  presidents, government, Congress, and the direction of the country. President Obama had an approval rating of about 48 percent at this point in May of 2012, on his way to being reelected by a wide margin. Joe Biden has an approval rating of only 45 percent, as against 46 percent disapproval, and that’s with Biden mostly shielded from public view. Biden’s penchant for gaffes largely escape notice when his public appearances mainly consist of reading from a Teleprompter in his basement, whereas Trump’s gaffes make headlines. Biden bears no responsibility for all the things that have gone wrong, whereas Trump not only gets heaped with blame, but the pressure of managing a crisis spurs him on to more gaffes. Trump probably doesn’t need to win a plurality of voters to win a majority of Electoral College votes. And being disliked by a majority didn’t stop him before: The day he was elected president, he had a 37.5 percent approval rating, according to the The headline of a different CNN news story about the same poll carries the headline, “CNN Poll: Negative ratings for government handling of coronavirus persist” over a picture of Trump looking downcast. This story, unlike the other one, mentions (but not till the fourth paragraph) that Trump’s approval rating of 45 percent “now matches his high point in CNN polling dating back to the start of his term.”Only after all of this stuff did we learn that CNN has a new poll out, under the headline, “The main story was about a church that lost 44 parishioners to COVID-19. The second-most prominent story told us that “Grocery Prices Are Soaring” (which is true if you think that a 2.6 percent increase in April should be called “soaring”), the third-most-prominent item told us, “Doctors treating coronavirus patients are seeing odd and frightening syndromes.” Running down the rail on the right we were given such important developments as “Man refusing to wear a mask breaks arm of Target employee,” “CNN Investigates: He’s willing to get Covid-19 to speed up vaccine efforts,” “Five surfers die after huge layer of sea foam hampers rescue” and “How coronavirus spread from one member to 87% of the singers at a choir practice.”<span class=""drop"">W</span>

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span><strong>ADDENDUM</strong>Maybe you’re the kind of person who looks at the White House now and is thrilled at the prospect of four more years of this kind of steadiness, single-minded focus, overflowing empathy and magnanimousness, and even-headed rationality from President Donald Trump. Or maybe you’re the kind of person who watches Joe Biden’s remote interviews and remarks from his basement in Delaware and can’t wait to see that eloquence, concentration, attention to detail, and original ideas and sharp-minded incisiveness in the Oval Office next January. We are truly blessed to have these two vital, fresh, hale and hearty options before us this November.It is as tall an order, and as complicated and multifaceted, as any president has faced — comparable to the challenge of the Cold War, or World War II, or the Great Depression, or the Civil War. Few in their right minds would want to be president right now. Even if you make many more right decisions than wrong ones, people will still be frustrated with the sweeping changes to our life, all driven by a virus jumping into humans from some bat. These will be remembered as extraordinarily different times.You thought populism was a powerful force in the world’s politics before the coronavirus? Just wait until afterwards. At this point, it is impossible to ignore the fact that most of the people calling for the reopening of society either no longer have a paycheck or are at risk of losing theirs. But everyone making the decisions to extend the lockdowns or publicly supporting that decision still has his. Even if they have the best of intentions and an accurate sense of the risk, the haves are choosing to further immiserate the have-nots.Those insufferable commercials and celebrity videos declare, “We’re all in this together.” But we really aren’t. As I joked on the On some level, that’s what the survivors of that pandemic wanted. Kenneth C. Davis, author of  You may have noticed that in both your history education and the general discussion of American history in our culture, you read, heard, and saw very little about the 1918 Influenza outbreak. (The name is a little misleading; the waves of the pandemic continued into 1919, and even had a minor wave in 1920.) It’s odd hearing a decent amount about events shortly before, during, and after the outbreak — the sinking of the Titanic, the Ford Model-T coming to the market and the development of automobiles, the digging of the Panama Canal, the sinking of the Lusitania, World War I, Woodrow Wilson’s presidency, the Roaring Twenties . . . but the deadliest pandemic in world history is so rarely mentioned, it’s almost airbrushed out of the picture.I think the aspect of this ordeal that I am contemplating the most these days is the psychological effect on all of us. We have been through tough times before, but this experience is different.For most of 2020 and perhaps into 2021, Americans will not be able to gather in crowds. Handshakes may well be gone.The world beyond our borders is not going to be safer in the era of the coronavirus. China realizes the world will blame it if it doesn’t convince the world to blame America first. Iran is not going to become freer, more stable, or less extreme with a terrible, ever-increasing death toll. The same goes for most of Africa — Reformers warned about the unsustainability of America’s higher-education system, with its runaway tuition hikes, for decades now. Now, The American education system can handle hobbling through the second half of the spring semester with distance learning. Teachers, kids, and parents are stressed, but almost everyone is doing the best they can in unforeseen and extraordinarily difficult circumstances. But if the nation’s schools don’t restart under something resembling normalcy in late August and September . . . do we run the risk of a generation of kids who are at least partially less-educated than their peers? The nation’s children have endured months of social distancing, and apparently have more months of this to come. Just what is that doing to their minds?When 2021 arrives, how many of America’s doctors will retire? Or need a lengthy sabbatical? Or be struggling with physical- and mental-health issues of their own?Our medical community has responded in a way that should inspire legends of their heroism being told and retold for generations. But the cost of that Herculean effort, in terms of burnout, is going to be enormous. (I came across a quote from a doctor declaring, “Will Americans trust nursing and long-term care homes with their elderly parents anymore? If enough Americans look at the past few months and conclude they can’t trust them with mom and dad, do those facilities bring in enough money to stay open?Certain industries will probably never be the same. Air travel will probably only return slowly, and with it, most businesses connected to tourism — hotels, restaurants, shops, rides, amusement parks. Any business that involves large gatherings — conventions, concerts, sporting events without considerable television revenues — will be slow to recover. Movie-theater chains have no idea how they’ll get through this. Film and television production is halted. Professional sports leagues will carry on, but no one will be watching in person for a long while.The American economy in January 2021 will probably better than it is now — a really low bar to clear! — but it will probably not be “back.” The Congressional Budget Office And if and when that vaccine is developed and available for the general public . . . how does America handle the anti-vaccination crowd for this virus?Yesterday, World Health Organization emergencies director Dr. Mike Ryan ruffled some feathers by warning that the coronavirus may never “go away.” He pointed out that we have a vaccine for measles, yet the measles If that comes to pass, we would be able to inoculate our most vulnerable populations, and that would be a big step. But it would still take a long stretch of 2021 to bring the vaccine to all Americans, and any morally responsible American government would recognize a need to help the rest of the world get vaccinated, too. Depending upon how much this virus mutates and how much our immune systems can adapt to the changes in the virus, we may need regular vaccinations against it for the foreseeable future.If we’re lucky, we will have a vaccine. We don’t know exactly how our lives will be in January, but it’s not so far away that we can’t get some ideas.Being president is going to stink for at least the next two years, and probably more — even by the historical standards of a job that appears to be powerful and glamorous but that tends to age its occupants about a decade for each term. The task of overcoming this virus and recovering from its enormous cost in human lives, human health, and economic ruin will rank among the greatest challenges in American history, and for a long while, the job of the president is going to be an endless series of hard choices, picking from menus with only bad options.How would you feel? Some of you might feel excited, but I suspect quite a few people would feel trepidation and pressure and think, “Ugh, what did I ever do to deserve this?”Imagine that through some entirely unforeseeable sequence of events, the person who takes the oath of office to serve as President of the United States on January 20, 2021, is not Donald Trump or Joe Biden but . . . you.<strong>Being President Is Going to Stink for Years to Come</strong>On the menu today: a long look at the myriad challenges facing the person to take the oath of office to be president on January 20, 2021.National ReviewFollow Us",0,What Does the Post-Pandemic Presidency Look Like?

No charge.As Washington put it, we must “continue the utmost Vigilance against this most dangerous enemy.” That means responding to this latest crisis while guarding those liberties that our Founders fought to establish.Of course, things are different today, from technology to ease of travel to the expansion of government assistance. And no one is advocating that we simply replicate the medical directives of the 18th century. But the analogies to our Founding period are instructive, and the overarching questions of economic and political freedoms remain. Times change. But Americans’ fundamental rights need not.  The Founding generation did not see it as the government’s role to meddle in healthy people’s businesses and communities, nor did they trust their politicians to make the correct call. The Founders valiantly fought against the overreaches of the British Crown. And they were eager not to trade in their hard-won freedoms for another overbearing government. Instead, they established a great American experiment of self-government that respected the individual.Rather than broad, government-imposed shutdowns, the Founding generation relied on individuals’ coming together in the manner that made sense locally. Port cities made incoming ships quarantine. The sick closed their shops. Children and elderly were separated from the less vulnerable. But just as market forces drove people away from typically crowded fish markets, printers kept operating, blacksmiths kept working, farmers kept to their fields, and so on according to particular circumstances.In the end, our disharmony was also our strength: Rather than a single, top-down approach to the crisis, different communities employed diverse tactics tailored to their area’s specific needs. As with Washington’s inoculation saga, they learned from one another’s setbacks and successes as though in a living laboratory. And the American experiment triumphed.Laws were local. Massachusetts required the head of each household to report any infections and raise a red flag outside their doors. North Carolina built “pesthouses” to isolate the infected in remote areas. Hard-hit South Carolina even put houses of the infected under armed guard. New Hampshire checked all visitors arriving from Boston.Like today, the epidemic fomented discord over the nation’s response. While politicians argued, different states advocated varying approaches. Sparsely populated rural Virginia faced different circumstances from the city centers of New York or Boston. And each reacted accordingly to balance health risks with longer-term consequences for liberties and livelihoods.Washington’s most important order during the war was not military, it was medical. But after his success in saving his troops, Washington never forced civilians to inoculate; he instead led them by example. He and the Founders believed in permitting individuals to prudently exercise their liberties, operating in their best interests while also collaborating with one another to protect their neighbors.But Washington followed the science: He had witnessed the successes other communities enjoyed with inoculation and asserted his authority as commander-in-chief to push for the procedure with his troops. This move was unprecedented: The American army became the first in history to employ wholesale smallpox inoculation.While this inoculation procedure had been used in India for thousands of years, it was relatively new to the West. Many feared it would just spread the severe version of the disease. New York’s legislature forbade inoculation and even jailed a doctor caught treating Washington’s troops.
In the end, however, the quarantines proved difficult to enforce and ultimately unable to stop the spread, so inoculation emerged as the only real solution. But Washington faced fierce opposition. Inoculation was a grotesque procedure that involved first scratching the patient’s arm and inserting pus from a smallpox victim into the healthy person’s wound. This would cause the patient to contract a case far milder than if he were to inhale the virus or otherwise catch it more naturally. But he would enjoy lasting immunity.Despite being centuries of technological advancement behind us, our first commander-in-chief’s approach to the epidemic parallels today’s: Washington first moved to seal off his troops from foreign entrants, then he checked for symptoms within his camp and quarantined anyone suspected of being infected.Also like today, there were concerns that adversaries might use disease against us. The British intentionally sent infected prisoners back to American communities to spread the scourge. In fact, one British officer recommended, “Dip arrows in matter of smallpox and twang them at the American rebels.” (Guns and bullets were almost universal at this point; this measure was intended specifically to injure and infect.) Whether actively spreading the virus or merely taking advantage of its natural spread, Washington’s enemies sought to leverage America’s weakened state.Much like today, the virus not only sickened the civilian population but also ravaged the U.S. servicemen, leaving them vulnerable to enemy attack. During the Battle of New York City in 1776, the smallpox epidemic grew so dire that Commander-in-Chief George Washington described it as more dangerous than “the Sword of the Enemy.” And he was correct — for every soldier killed in battle, an estimated ten others died from disease.Smallpox swept the United States during the Revolutionary War. The most dreaded illness of the era, smallpox was an incredibly contagious virus that caused a high fever and rashes, killing 17 percent of those infected. Like COVID-19, the virus was readily spread person-to-person by inhalation, with the infected showing symptoms within 14 days of exposure.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

The end result will be that the CDC’s attention will continue to be divided, and it will likely fail again the next time around.The CDC highlights its recent accomplishments on pages 18 to 23. How is CDC Director Redfield supposed to remain alert to emerging epidemics when he is also supposed to manage programs on tiny teeth, colon cancer, opioids, child abuse, diabetes, workers’ compensation, lead‐​based paints, mold in buildings, and lifting heavy objects on construction sites?CDC leaders may have been distracted because of mission‐​sprawl.

The CDC workforce increased 12 percent between 2010 and 2019, based on data in CDC budget submissions Chris Edwards has a Since 2014, the CDC has continued to dedicate time, energy, and funding toward issues that, while perhaps important, fall outside of its reason for existence. As a result, the CDC has devolved into an agency incapable of adequately addressing the serious threat posed by infectious disease, particularly novel diseases for which there is little information about risk, spread, and treatment.Guiding those reforms should be the realization that the agency’s failure to perform its core public-health mission of infectious diseases and epidemics is in part due to a severe mission creep and other fashionable distractions. Michelle Minton of the Competitive Enterprise Institute has Between the COVID-19 test fiasco, the often-changed messages about the virus and mask-wearing, and the flop of the CDC’s initiative to create an early-warning system in selected cities, the first order of business once this is over should be to do a full audit followed by serious reforms of an agency that we shouldn’t be trusting blindly.The initial testing delay has certainly cost lives. It is also at least partially to blame for the severe quarantine policies that have tipped the American economy into a deep recession — without adequate testing, there was little else for policymakers to do except close the country in the hopes of slowing the disease’s spread.The nonsensical war on vaping may have tarnished the CDC’s credibility on the A lot has been written about the National ReviewFollow Us",0,CDC Failure and Mission Sprawl

According to Illinois Right to Life, Planned Parenthood used shell-company names on its license applications so no one would be aware that an abortion clinic was opening in the area until it had been approved.But yesterday, Pritzker warned that he will crack down on any business or local area that attempts to stray from his order before he allows it. “Businesses and individual professionals that are licensed by state agencies can be held accountable for defying public health orders,” he said. “Counties that try to reopen in defiance will not be reimbursed by FEMA for damage they cause themselves. Local law enforcement and the Illinois State Police can and will take action.”Illinois governor, Democrat J. B. Pritzker, remains adamant that he will not begin to lift the lockdown he has imposed in his state or consider a phased reopening that loosens restrictions in less-affected areas. Several mayors and sheriffs in suburban and rural parts of the state have suggested that will begin easing local regulations and cease enforcing the stay-at-home order, as the number of cases of COVID-19 in their counties are far less severe than in urban areas of Illinois.National ReviewFollow Us",0,"Despite Lockdown, Planned Parenthood Opens New Illinois Clinic"

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.Mike Segar/ReutersA man walks dogs across a nearly empty 5th Avenue during the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak in Manhattan, May 11, 2020. AdvertisementWe are all muddling through, trying to live the best we can while this threat is out there. We are tempted to take out the frustration, anxiety, and anger these months have generated on each other. But what most of us need now is the mercy of basic kindness.Among my own friends and family, plans for extensive plane travel have been put off indefinitely. Masks are worn in public places, but not on walks around the neighborhood, where socialization happens halfway across the street. At the same time, summer-vacation plans that are more local remain on. We hear the deposits are still coming in at normal rates for rentals in our usual Jersey beach town. And the beaches are opening up for the season (with restrictions).There are fewer neat divisions among public figures as well.  Dr. Fauci advised on a well-conceived plan for opening up. Some of the most vociferous dissenters against lockdown, such as the British journalist Peter Hitchens, are nonetheless conscientious about wearing a face covering and keeping distance in public.  
   At the beginning of this crisis, I wrote that plagues have a tendency   
   On the other side of the ledger, the worst doomsaying predictions of millions of deaths have been memory-holed. The most dire epidemiological models, like the infamous Imperial College study, have danced around like a loose firehose as the store of actual data about social behavior in the crisis grew. Pandemic hawks who predicted major breakouts from spring breakers, from Florida beaches, or from Georgia’s re-opening before its number of cases declined all turned out to be wrong, not just on the scale of the outbreak but on the direction.The fiercest skeptics There is a good reason to hesitate to judge, namely our ignorance. Plagues are a time for scapegoats and blame-shifting precisely because they deal out suffering such a seemingly unjust and random fashion. Our leaders say they will follow the science, but they can’t, really. With a heretofore-unseen virus such as this one, the science is more like inherited wisdom and intuition from previous, similar maladies, at least at the start. What follows is a confused rush to catch up through trial and error. The results are not always pretty, or immediately useful. And although those who stay with their own carefully constructed echo chambers might think otherwise, where COVID-19 is concerned the evidence has not come down decisively on one side or the other of the false lockdown/let-’er-rip dichotomy.So, at the risk of sounding like a total drip, let me just say: People, try to be generous to one another.All that sacrifice and suffering can make publicly debating the issues surrounding the pandemic and our response to it incredibly difficult. Someone venting an uncontrolled anger at masks may be hurting for a relative whose economic situation just became a lot more precarious, or for a loved one who just died. Someone shouting “grandma killer” at a conscientious person who nonetheless voices skepticism of or dissents from shut-in orders may be feeling real, coronavirus-related pain.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Americans have also suffered tremendous personal losses. The ersatz expansion of our personal networks through social media means that almost everyone is acquainted with at least one of the over 85,000 people whose deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 in the United States, or at least knows someone else who is grieving.Supposedly, Americans hate the experts. But overwhelmingly the American people have complied with their advice to socially distance, so much so that the curve has flattened into a plateau and is now starting to slope downward. In fact, in some ways, Americans were ahead of or anticipated the advice of officialdom. Perhaps one-fifth of the country has helped accomplish this by taking enormous leaps into the unknown, unsure whether life would be the same once the crisis began to pass. In an age when some conservatives have asked if their countrymen were capable of recognizing the common good, the coronavirus has provided enormous proof that our countrymen are willing to sacrifice for it.The public polling seems to show that a significant minority thinks our pandemic-control measures have gone too far, even as a significant majority supports continued efforts at social distancing. Capable public leadership and institutions can, through heroic effort, more or less harmonize those instincts. In East Asian countries, a public conditioned by the 2003 SARS outbreak met a proactive public-health response, allowing cities such as Seoul and Singapore to get to back to something resembling normal more quickly than their European and American counterparts. (The What is true is that people will feel themselves instinctively sympathetic to one message or another ringing out from these online camps, whether it’s, “I’m done with this” or, “The health of my spouse is more important than your haircut” or simply, “This is unsustainable.”<span class=""drop"">I</span>

Even wealthy people just can’t swallow the jagged pill of tuition if it doesn’t involve getting to send their kids away for four years. It’s like, “Wait, my kid’s going to be home most of the year? Staring at a computer screen?” There’s this horrific awakening being delivered via Zoom of just how substandard and overpriced education is at every level. I can’t tell you the number of people who have asked me, “Should my kid consider taking a gap year?”At universities, we’re having constant meetings, and we’ve all adopted this narrative of “This is unprecedented, and we’re in this together,” which is Latin for “We’re not lowering our prices, b*****s.” Universities are still in a period of consensual hallucination with each saying, “We’re going to maintain these prices for what has become, overnight, a dramatically less compelling product offering.”<strong>ADDENDUM</strong>Can we please do away with this reflexive belief among the media that Democratic officeholders and their appointed staff are inherently wise and good and compassionate and smart?

Yes, Trump blurts out something nutty like his injecting disinfectant comments with metronomic regularity. I would still argue de Blasio is worse, and it’s not just because he spent January, February, and early March telling New Yorkers to continue their usual routines, Remember, in what feels like another era, when New York City mayor Bill de Blasio ran for president? And the vast majority of the country — including Democrats — spent five minutes listening to him and asked, “How the heck did this guy ever get elected to anything?”<strong>Speaking of New York and the Worst . . .</strong>Cuomo also has something else DeSantis doesn’t: a press that defers to him, one that preferred to cover “<em>First, let’s just come out and say it:</em>Florida just doesn’t look nearly as bad as the national news media and sky-is-falling critics have been predicting for about two months now. But then, the national news media is mostly based in New York and loves to love its Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, about as much as it loves to hate on Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.Yesterday, Gee, do you think that deeply divided partisan reaction has anything to do with the fact that so much of the discussion of this virus and the response has been a wildly oversimplified and often flat-out factually wrong “Yesterday, <strong>Gee, Media World, Why <em>Would</em> Americans Be Divided Right Now?</strong>What we know can change. Perhaps our appetite for rubbing someone’s nose in their getting something wrong has created an enormous disincentive for anyone ever admitting they’re wrong — and an inadvertent incentive for stubbornly clinging to an assessment, even in the face of mounting counter-evidence.We think All of us, from the president and Fauci to the kids down the street are trying to grapple with the unknown. Just about all of us are going to get something wrong at some point. Here we are, May 15, and we’re still not entirely sure whether children are largely immune to this virus, or The first point is to target interventions where needed, toward high-risk populations, including older people and other people with health conditions that render them more susceptible to disease. But the current organized panic in the United States does not seem justified on the best reading of the data. In dealing with this point, it is critical to note that the rapid decline in the incidence of new cases and death in China suggests that cases in Italy will not continue to rise exponentially over the next several weeks. Moreover, it is unlikely that the healthcare system in the United States will be compromised in the same fashion as the Epstein’s numbers were wildly off-base, but his concluding point in that essay wasn’t cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs:The Hoover Institution’s Richard Epstein got an enormous amount of grief for writing an essay posted on March 16 about policies for the outbreak, initially estimating that the toll of the coronavirus would be only 500 people, and then revising it upward to 5,000, and then later to 50,000. Epstein called it, “They call it a novel coronavirus because it’s I think highly of Dr. Anthony Fauci and think just about everything he says during this outbreak is worth careful consideration. But there’s no getting around the fact that some of his early assessments were really off base, too. On January 21, the day the first U.S. case was discovered, Fauci said during an interview, “obviously, you need to take it seriously and do the kind of things the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the Department of Homeland Security is doing. But this is not a major threat to the people of the United States and this is not something that the citizens of the United States right now should be worried about.” In another interview on January 26, he repeated, “The American people should not be worried or frightened by this. It’s a very, very low risk to the United States, but it’s something we, as public health officials, need to take very seriously.”It’s five weeks later, and we’re at 85,906.You may recall that by April 8, when deaths were at about 17,000, No, apparently not!You may recall that at the end of March, President Trump said, “so if we can hold that down, as we’re saying, to 100,000, it’s a horrible number, maybe even less, but to 100,000, so we have between 100 [thousand] and 200,000, we altogether have done a very good job.” Many commentators, particularly on the Left, thought Trump had not merely moved the goalposts from his past statements that the virus would go away, or that it was not as dangerous as the flu, but was setting an absurdly low bar for a “good job.” At the end of March, the United States had barely 4,000 deaths. Surely, Trump had to be setting expectations at an unrealistically high number, so he could come back later and claim victory, right?You noticed that the arguments of “It’s just the flu!” or “This is comparable to the flu!” or “The flu kills more people each year!” stopped sometime in the past few weeks, didn’t you? Even the skeptics can count. (As According to the <strong>Errors Are a Part of Life, but We Shouldn’t Cling to Them</strong>On the menu today: We could all dunk on people who were wrong in their early assessments of this pandemic, but the more pressing question is who is not learning from getting things wrong during this outbreak; one mainstream publication notices that the conventional wisdom on Florida was far from the truth; why the media’s reflexive partisan sympathies are leading Americans to not understand the virus and what policies work best to mitigate it; and a funny and brutally honest assessment of what’s coming to higher education.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Being Wrong Is Human and Will Happen.

					© 2020 National Review				Our Capital Letter email newsletter delivers a weekly digest on finance, business, and economics from an NR sensibility.But the anti-mask crowd now advocates eschewing one’s individual interest in favor of empty symbolic gestures — an example of the irrational behavior that statists use to argue against free markets. Conflating personal protective measures with government overreach all but guarantees that the latter will be necessary.The efficacy of masks strengthens the anti-lockdown case. It is exactly the kind of spontaneous decision-making that often renders government intrusion needless and inefficient. The “invisible hand” of the free market depends on rational individuals acting in their self-interest. We’ve seen this phenomenon in jurisdictions that did not lock down but nonetheless saw sizable reductions in economic activity. People did not want to contract COVID-19 and took reasonable steps to minimize their risk.The irony is that civil-libertarian objections to masks make draconian measures more likely. The more people refuse to wear masks, the greater the risks of reopening. Where mask-wearing has taken hold — in Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, for example — life has proceeded in quasi-normalcy: Many businesses and schools are open, and people are free to socialize. The comparatively repressive East Asian democracies have retained more civil liberties than the U.S. thanks, in part, to the rational behavior of their citizens.
Suddenly there’s a new trend: mask-skeptics on the political right. After Vice President Pence got flak for not covering his face on a visit to the Mayo Clinic, Trump’s base has come to see masks as a symbol of government overreach. Fox News host Laura Ingraham dedicated a segment to denouncing mask use: “They’ll say this whole mask thing is settled science just like they do with climate change. Of course, it’s not and they know it.” Ohio governor Mike DeWine, who initially mandated the use of masks in his state, rolled back the requirement in the face of public backlash, reasoning that “people were not going to accept the government telling them what to do.” Some pundits have even argued that mask-wearing is a sign of “cowardice.”The belated guidelines are welcome. But for many on the political right, this initial “noble lie” reinforced a broader distrust of government. Bureaucrats’ willingness to obfuscate meant that individuals had to make reasoned decisions on their own rather than rely on government dictates. The mask imbroglio cast doubt on the claim that “experts” alone could address the pandemic and bolstered the case for a localized response.What explains the change? A large body of A few weeks later, masks have become a symbol of civic responsibility, following new CDC guidelines encouraging their use.

If all the words about protecting all lives have meaning, we have got to combat this throwaway society Pope Francis has talked about and This is a high-anxiety time to say the least. I hesitate to rush to condemnation. A little too much of that is in the area everywhere — the canceling, the scolding. People make bad decisions that cost lives. And if one of the lessons of this coronavirus time is not that we are all vulnerable and our life has an unknown expiration date, I don’t know what we’ve been doing with our time. But in the case of the nursing homes and the rationing, too, what do these decisions say about what we value? It’s like Bill de Blasio threatening to permanently shut down places of worship if they violate rules for gathering. They shouldn’t violate the rules when so many have been trying to be careful in a crisis situation. But you also can’t help but think we saw a little of his ideological heart there exposed, of the same spirit that has kept the Little Sisters of the Poor in court to fight for their ability to serve as their conscience mandates.Charlie Camosy, who teaches ethics at Fordham University, has been vigilant in warning from the beginning of this coronavirus crisis about the dangers of throwing away life — of rationing, making decisions that put the most vulnerable at the end of the priority line. He’s been trying to keep us honest, in other words. I’ve written about some of Andrew Cuomo’s words about how priceless every human life is. We, of course, know that his abortion expansion and celebration of it in the Empire State is inconsistent with his words about life, an inconsistency he obviously does not see. And now in these coronavirus days, there is his administration having insisted that patients go back into nursing homes from hospitals regardless of whether or not they tested positive for COVID-19. We know what that is consistent with. It’s consistent with abortions still happening in the state while we were supposed to be trying to save lives, not end them. It’s consistent with a governor who has raised his voice in favor of assisted suicide. Mercifully, medically assisted suicide does not exist in New York. Though it does next door in New Jersey; you have to wonder if Governor Murphy has a sick feeling that that was some of the worst preparation for a pandemic when people are finding themselves tempted by every kind of darkness.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Do We Really Value Life or Just Live in Fear for Our Own?

It’s encouraging to think about a health system that’s more patient-centric — more ready, willing, and able to meet patients where they live, in part by leveraging the convenience and scale of competitive private-sector offerings from both large, established corporations such as Walmart and nascent startups. It’s also a welcome change to feel that tech may be finally be deployed in the service of patients, rather than championed as an end in itself (if only the benighted masses would adopt it). Let’s hope as well that serious tech companies continue to approach health care with the humility and collaborative intent demonstrated this week, and that they forge partnerships with the health-care community that authentically prioritize <strong>A Better Normal? </strong>Similarly, Walmart’s Osborne highlighted the increased opportunities to provide care and support for patients outside of the traditional medical clinic, whether through at-home kits or the provision of testing and care in more convenient settings. “As communities and individuals and families grasp for healthcare needs,” he said, “they’re not finding public-health infrastructure that exists at any kind of significant scale,” and instead often rely on other organizations to fill the gap. “We’ve done a disservice to consumers by not allowing diagnostic and lab pieces to be up front and more accessible, and COVID has just exposed that.”In particular, Nabel emphasized the increased use of digital tools and the re-imagination of the ambulatory-patient experience, changes that would likely lead to less space for ambulatory care in the hospital. “Digital care will expand and be a foundation to all the care that we deliver,” Nabel said. “The transition to consumer-focused health care will accelerate,” which “will mean more choices are available, care will be less hospital-centric, more outpatient/ambulatory, in the home in many ways. We don’t even know what routine care is going to look like in the future.”An inescapable takeaway from the conference was the sense that as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, some long-contemplated changes in America health care may have at last arrived. Chief among these is a vision of care authentically built around the life needs of a person, rather than the operational needs of the medical system. As Nabel explained, she and her colleagues recognized that the crisis represented “an opportunity to think bold and think differently, and implement those changes [that] maybe we’ve wanted to do all along but didn’t have the courage to.”  
   <strong>Patient-centered medicine at last?</strong>“I want to be sure that we don’t leave people behind,” Microsoft’s Weinstein said. “We have to be very thoughtful about how we move technology forward in the next generation, and the generation after that, to narrow the gap of disparities, which we still haven’t done.”Dr. Karen DeSalvo, In contrast to the grandiose arrogance typically associated with tech giants and the irrepressible   
   <strong>Big Tech projects restraint. </strong>Biddinger explained to me later that we lack “the ability to ‘flag’ patients associated with disasters [including outbreaks but also no-notice mass-casualty events] in all systems,” and to “define the basic data fields that are ‘always captured’ . . . when the flag is set.” Weinstein agreed, and was especially concerned about the learning opportunities that would be missed because of our basic inability to share data more effectively. He noted that in his previous role at Dartmouth, where he led the large Dartmouth–Hitchcock health system, he was able to cut the mortality rate for sepsis from 55 percent to 10 percent in about three months by enabling better data sharing and communication. He offered a similar prescription for the management of the coronavirus pandemic, arguing that there’s a need to share “data elements we agree on . . . tools that let these data flow.” This seems similar in intent to the “Public health has been underrepresented in the tech space,” said Dr. Jim Weinstein, the senior vice president for Microsoft Healthcare. “Technology is fantastic, but if we can’t talk to each other, we can’t communicate the appropriate data.”Marcus Osborne, the vice president of Walmart Health, lamented that, “We [Americans] don’t really have a public-health infrastructure.”Dr. Paul Biddinger, who leads emergency preparedness at MGH, highlighted the need to gather “patient presentation data — the emergency-department visits, the clinic visits, the hospitalizations, the ICU visits that tell us whether or not the pace [of reopening] is too fast. . . . Right now, we don’t gather all that data from all those different sources in an aggregate way and link it to the decisions that are being made.”<strong>It’s prohibitively difficult to gather and aggregate relevant clinical data in a timely fashion.</strong>“Explosive” is how John Fernandez, the head of ambulatory services at the Mass General Brigham (MGB) system, described the growth, and growth prospects, for telehealth and virtual care: “I figure if my 86-year-old father can learn Zoom in a week, there’s going to be a lot of explosion in this technology.” The numbers would seem to bear out his point. At MGH, the use of telemedicine climbed from a baseline of less than 1 percent of outpatient visits to over 85 percent, Slavin said. According to MGB’s chief clinical officer, Dr. Gregg Meyer, the amount of care delivered virtually within the MGB system increased from 2 percent to nearly 60 percent. The actual number of virtual visits increased from 1,000–2,000 per month to 240,000–250,000 per month, said Dr. Alistair Erskine, the chief digital-health officer at Brigham Health — an extraordinary 200-fold change.<span>NOW WATCH: </span><strong>The use of telehealth has surged. </strong>“We’re very concerned about the cases that we’re not seeing, the decreased number of cardiac and stroke patients showing up in our emergency room” added Dr. Peter Slavin, the president of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). “The fear associated with this virus is very real and is going to take some time to be overcome.”“During March and April, many of our patients with heart disease, with lung disease, with cancer, with diabetes, were simply afraid to come to the hospital, so they didn’t get the care they needed,” said Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, the president of Boston’s Brigham Health, and they are “now returning to the hospital much sicker than if they came previously.” She also noted that the cardiac-catheterization lab — incidentally a key revenue-generator for the hospital — was less than half occupied when normally it would’ve been full.<strong>Deferred care — the health services non-COVID patients should be receiving but aren’t — is an increasingly serious problem.</strong>Yet somehow, out of this maelstrom, several surprisingly consistent themes have emerged, as I learned this week at a large medical-innovation <span class=""drop"">T</span>

					© 2020 National Review				Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you. No charge.As they consider when and how to lift the COVID-19 quarantine, public officials should start tracking public opinion. The ultimate arbiter of how to strike the balance will be the public itself.Striking the right balance of safety and the resumption of normal activity depends on how countless individuals will seek to balance their own priorities. The government simply doesn’t have that information — which was Friedrich Hayek’s central observation about why socialism can’t work no matter how good the government’s planners are. That is why, as Dr. Joel Zinberg and I Given a choice, many people who live in New York City are likely to prefer taking their chances with the virus over giving up the things that make living in New York City worthwhile. In coming weeks, communities all over the country are likely to start making similar choices. Officials need to start thinking of public choice not as an obstacle to good policy, but as the central driver of it. That puts a special premium on their role in ensuring that the public is as informed as possible.In New York City and San Francisco, restaurants have to be great to survive at all; even operating at nearly full capacity, they still struggle. In Manhattan, apartment floor plans have long assumed that people are largely outsourcing their kitchens and living rooms. “Social distancing” used to mean that the music was set just loud enough so that you could hear the person you were eating with but not the person inches away at the next table. If social distancing is enforced for bars and restaurants in places like New York City, the only establishments that will survive are those than can charge prices two or three times higher than currently. That would make bars and restaurants a rare luxury for the very rich.Take bars and restaurants. It may be years before we fully go back to normal in that sector. When we do, people will likely keep up preventive practices, such as wearing masks (when not actually eating or drinking) and gloves, and washing their hands often. But to require social distancing in restaurants will have hugely disparate impacts from region to region. Such measures will entail dramatically higher costs for businesses where commercial rents are high, such as in New York City and San Francisco, compared with rural areas where space is plentiful and warmer areas where restaurants can offer more seating outdoors.Where conditions and attitudes vary greatly from one region to another, local choice maximizes the number of people who will wind up with the outcome they prefer. Of course, in a pandemic the problem of local choice is obvious: Infection spreads quickly from one jurisdiction to another, so loose public-health measures in any jurisdiction can endanger people everywhere. And yet, if a virus is pervasive, and the goal of public policy is to reduce the local risk of infection, then local choice is likely still the most attractive option — even in a pandemic.COVID-19 has already killed more people in two months than died from influenza and pneumonia in all of 2017, when those illnesses were the eighth-leading cause of death. Of course, to prevent the flu, many people don’t take even the most minimal precautions, such as washing hands, covering mouths when coughing, staying home when sick, or getting flu shots. People sick with flu routinely go to work or school knowing that they will infect others. Society accepts the risk of serious injury, from a variety of common activities, even more readily. Consider the sporting events you take your children to. Every year in American there are about The third-leading cause of accidental death was alcohol. In the 1920s, the U.S. tried prohibition, and the chief result was a stupendous increase in organized and violent crime. Today, moderate social drinking is a highly prized pastime. Most people accept the necessity of laws against drunk driving, but they aren’t willing to accept excessive restrictions on their use of alcohol even to save tens of thousands of lives a year, to say nothing of the countless lives and families ruined by alcoholism. The second-leading cause of accidental death in 2017 was motor-vehicle accidents. Speed limits were long a matter of state law, but in the 1970s Congress enacted a national speed limit of 55 mph. Noncompliance was rampant, particularly in rural areas. The limit was raised to 65 mph in 1987, and in 1995 the law was repealed, returning the setting of speed limits to the states. Local preferences, based on regional variations, won out over a single national speed limit. Public-choice theory holds that, whereas unanimity entails prohibitive decision costs, simple majority rule maximizes the externality of people’s being forced to accept outcomes they do not want. This negative effect increases disproportionately with scale — a considerable downside of national majority rule.Among drugs, the leading killer is heroin, possession of which is a criminal offense. Many policy experts think that the War on Drugs is a bad policy because it entails social costs that cannot be justified by its meager benefits. But people are not willing to accept the legalization and regulation of such drugs, even if legalization might reduce both the risks to drug users and related externalities (such as ruined families and rampant crime). So the policy endures despite not yielding the hoped-for benefits. As former secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld likes to say, public policies are usually judged by their intentions, not their results.That is true in virtually every major category of preventable death and serious injury, including those in which one person’s activity entails significant risk for others. 
The reason that many states’ highway speed limit is 65 mph is not that some transportation expert decided that is the ideal speed limit from a risk–benefit point of view. People simply won’t accept a lower speed limit on the interstate, even if it would save 20,000 lives a year. On the other hand, most people agree that driving 100 mph is excessively dangerous. The moral of the story is that people need and want a lot of things; balancing those priorities is what sets the bounds of “reasonableness.” And as it turns out, people think it’s perfectly reasonable to do lots of things that put both themselves and others at risk.Dr. Anthony Fauci has said that the virus will determine the timetable for reopening, but that simply cannot be true. Rates of infection, mortality, and immunity are of course crucial factors in getting the policy right, but the most crucial factor of all is public choice. It is people who will decide when to reopen, what safety measures are reasonable, and what risks — to themselves and others — are worth taking. Government officials face a difficult set of incentives. They are held responsible for the impacts of both the virus and the measures taken in response to it. Their interest in political survival will make them increasingly sensitive to popular sentiment. It is worth asking whether public opinion COVID-19 is an extremely dangerous virus. It will almost certainly be one of the top five leading causes of death in the United States this year, and may remain in the top five for years to come. But people are reaching the ends of their tethers with lockdowns. Amid the most massive job losses since the Great Depression, people sense that some draconian health measures aren’t worth the squeeze. Mass protests and noncompliance may be rare for now, and the lockdowns continue to enjoy substantial support in principle. But opinion varies widely from region to region and between rural and urban areas. As Scott Rasmussen has <script async="""" charset=""utf-8"" src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js""></script>— Rachel 🐶💙🇺🇸 (@RaychelTania) Haha, nope.

Earlier this month, Cortez requested that the state allow it to reopen some businesses, but was denied. “Our reviewers have some concerns about vulnerabilities in Montezuma County and want to monitor the situation before further considering a variance,” the state health department said in response.The 35-year-old man was found lying dead in a city park in Cortez by police, and Montezuma County Coroner George Deavers determined he had died of acute alcohol poisoning, after finding his blood alcohol concentration at .55, nearly double the amount considered lethal. After the deceased tested positive for coronavirus, Deavers said that state health authorities immediately characterized it as a death due to coronavirus.A Colorado county coroner says that state officials overruled him in classifying a man who had died from alcohol poisoning as a death due to coronavirus.National ReviewFollow Us",0,"Colorado State Health Dept.

No charge.These four ideas have one common feature: They are all <strong><em>Stabilizing Private Schools.</em></strong><strong><em>Closing Achievement Gaps.</em></strong>Governors can change this by investing in programs to develop cross-sector partnerships and innovative career pathways. Here’s just one example: Florida’s share of the funds, $173.6 million, could be carved into 430 five-year grants of $400,000 each. Each grant would be large enough to fund a nursing-school faculty member for five years. Each of these 400-plus faculty could train 20 more nurses a year, thereby creating a fresh infusion of almost 8,600 nurses for the state each year and boosting the state’s <strong><em>Workforce Preparedness.</em></strong>With COVID-19 still impacting our nation, students urgently need basic laptops or tablets to continue learning. They need broadband access to the Internet. In addition to providing these resources, CARES funds could be invested in statewide virtual schools, which can be a perfect solution for students who need more than their current schools offer. A long-run benefit of eliminating the digital divide is that teachers will be empowered with tools to help them personalize instruction and transform their classroom models, even after we return to “normal.”
<strong><em>Digital Learning.</em></strong>Here are four long-runway ideas that governors should consider tackling in their states with these fresh education dollars:Governors should entertain what I call “long runway” ideas — areas where the investment will pay off over a long period of time.

That’s an investment worth making.Trying to spread There will be no end to ways to spend the money: Education is expensive, and there will be plenty of claims on the money. Teacher pensions are depleted. School workers — bus drivers, support staff, administrators — all will want CARES funds to fill gaps in their budgets.

If I had to guess (and that is all anyone can do), Italian yields are going to go up a lot — and by a lot, I mean That is indeed the way to go. Even without the German decision on the ECB, the risks of buying Italian debt were too great, said Patrice Gautry, an economist at Union Bancaire Privee, as he mused on worst-case outcomes. “A bold option would be for Italy and other Club Med countries to split from the euro zone, with different, looser rules on the debt side,” he says. “It was something already discussed with the Greek crisis.”Intriguingly, the Bloomberg report also contains this:This remains unacceptable to the ‘northern’ bloc (Finland should be added to its ranks), to whom such bond issuance is unacceptable in its own right and as a step along the road to a fiscal union that the ‘frugal four’ fear (quite rightly) would be a transfer union, draining their taxpayers in perpetuity, another fear at least partly reflected in the BVG’s judgment.The wrangling was on display last week when euro-area finance chiefs approved a deal to provide ultra-cheap loans via its rescue fund, but without any onerous conditions. Yet the insistence by Italy’s populist opposition that such loans would undercut the country’s sovereignty has rendered them politically toxic — even if they would lead to greater savings. Along with France and Spain, Italy has been pushing the bloc for joint borrowing against opposition from the likes of Germany, the Netherlands and Austria.No one in Rome needed to hear the warning last week from the European Commission that the virus-spawned recession will be severe enough to put euro unity at risk. Like his forebears in 1992, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte felt abandoned by his allies early on in the pandemic when France and Germany ignored Italy’s cries for help. Italian opposition leader Matteo Salvini expresses sympathy for fans of a referendum on exiting that would tap into rising Italian frustration with the euro.And so, Bloomberg:The threat that Italy might quit the currency union remains one of its biggest weapons: It is too big to sail.And the chaos across the euro zone caused by an Italian exit would not stop there.To that should be added the mayhem to the internal-financing arrangements of the Eurosystem, particularly Another difference from 2011 is that the politics are much more complicated. Unlike Greece, Italy has meaningful leverage: foreign investors hold more than 700 billion euros of its bonds, a third of the total, according to Bank of Italy data. Any problem there would be enough to send shock waves through global financial markets and Europe’s weakened banking system.The ECB has enabled Italy to keep servicing its giant 2.4 trillion-euro ($2.6 trillion) debt load affordably. While the cost of insuring against default rose in March to its highest since 2013, 10-year bonds still yield less than 2%. In 2011, they topped 7%. The government tapped the market again Wednesday, selling 9 billion euros in bonds.Bloomberg:Meanwhile, for now, Italy can afford its debt load.And those are not the most pessimistic numbers out there.The European Commission sees gross domestic product shrinking 9.5% this year, after a 4.7% decline in the first quarter, the worst drop since the series started in 1995. That could swell its already massive debt to well over 150% of GDP.Bloomberg:<a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-13/ghost-of-1992-italy-devaluation-returns-to-haunt-euro-unity-aims?sref=KgEBWdKh"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Writing two days ago for Bloomberg</a>But the storm that is gathering over Italy — a storm that was somewhere in the mind of the BVG — cannot be so quickly wished away.Although most of the euro zone’s attention in the last week has been fixed on the clash between the German constitutional court (the BVG) on one side and the European Central Bank (ECB) and European Court on the other (a conflict I wrote about National ReviewFollow Us",0,Arrivederci Roma?

Northwestern Sex Week launched Monday and runs through May 15.Can masturbating to the image of a pile of cash bring … a pile of cash in real life?6. And yet, there was wisdom in this radically limited approach. Ancient, medieval, and early modern education had an oratorical orientation, recognizing that it was training leaders rather than experts. People who had been taught to imitate the classical authors, to analyze and understand their language, to construct valid arguments, and to make them persuasive, and who had committed to memory the virtuous and vicious deeds of the their noble predecessors had all the skills necessary to build civilization and inspire their peers to virtuous action. Whether we look to the Roman procurators and Chinese Mandarins of the empires of antiquity, the monks and scholastics of the medieval Church, or the bureaucrats and pioneers of more recent times, we see the constant of stable, efficient civil service carried out by leaders trained to revere a literary canon, to study it with traditional disciplines, and to see the unchanging contours of wise self-governance and prudent leadership in a constantly changing world. Although it is certainly mythical, perhaps no image more powerfully represents this ideal than that of our own frontier lawyers, who, like Abraham Lincoln and Jimmy Stewart’s Ranse Stoddard, went to bring order to the Wild West armed only with copies of Vergil, Blackstone, and the Bible in their saddlebags. For all this, we cannot help but notice that the foundations of civil society rest on the spiritual products of this older form of education rather than on the material and technological advancements of our (post-) industrial economy.Even the strongest advocates of classical education struggle to appreciate how limited its curricular basis was. Consisting of ancient history, primarily narrated through the “lives” of its great actors, epic and lyric poetry, and classical oratory, this educational model did not aim to be comprehensive. What little direct philosophical and ethical instruction was obtained from the rhetoricians Isocrates and Cicero rather than Plato and Aristotle. The appeal was protreptic or hortatory rather than theoretical or systematic. Now almost forgotten texts like the 5. At In due course, the prisoners became jailers and secret police, and eventually prisoners once more, as the revolution ate its own.<em>When revolution finally erupted in 1905, these exiled radicals transformed Siberia’s towns and villages into crucibles of violent struggle against the autocracy.

And Siberia has become a byword for such icy torment. It is the native vale of soul-making, to borrow a phrase from an English Romantic poet. As one denizen of the Arctic region Kolyma put it, “Here we have twelve months of winter. / The rest summer.” This everlasting winter has come to be associated with the slave labor camps of Stalin’s heyday, but already under the czars Siberian imprisonment followed by exile or military service was the standard punishment for political defiance as well as more conventional criminality.

At In this age of the coronavirus, these memories of hymns, rosaries and monstrances have come rushing back to me. It all makes particular sense, now. The Church is my inheritance and my personal responsibility. Why does the Faith sometimes bring me to tears and knock me to my knees? The answer: true Beauty will do that.I once traveled to Prague. So many Catholic churches there were shut down, decimated by decades of past Communist rule. I visited museums and it devastated me to see chalices, stoles and ornate monstrances all placed inside glass display cases, disposed, unused and forgotten, reduced to mere relics. It occurred to me that I had a pressing, personal responsibility to make sure that the same thing didn’t occur in my own home parish. It occurs to me, now, that there is a real possibility, if we are not careful and vigilant, that our own churches run the risk of becoming concert halls and museums.The year now, of course, is 2020. I am 58 years old. I live in South Boston. It is noon, and the Angelus bells just rang out from our beloved Gate of Heaven Church. As I am called to prayer, I am also again called to memory, and at the sound of the bells my heart leaps once more. Again, I am reminded of my father, my childhood, the saints and angels and even those martyred for the faith. I recollect one evening when I entered my parents’ bedroom and discovered my Father on his knees in prayer. He held his black rosary in his hands, his lips moving to the mysteries. Concluding his 3. Dear amiga Lori Kelly writes a wonderous piece for To deal with the growing menace posed by China’s diplomatic community, it is vital, therefore, that the West take robust action to protect its interests, and to hold China to account for its role in causing the pandemic in the first place, and then trying to cover its culpability by launching a global campaign to conceal the origins of the outbreak.On another level, they indulge in On one level, Chinese ambassadors, particularly those based in Western capitals, simply resort to The interventions of these Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, one of the more notable features of China’s response has been the willingness of senior Chinese diplomats to intervene forcibly in defence of China’s interests.The latest capitulation by the European Union in the face of Chinese intimidation demonstrates that, when it comes to protecting the interests of member states, the Brussels bureaucracy is no match for Beijing’s new breed of warrior diplomats.2.

Beijing is a master instiller of fear.With the country serving as a model, why does it need the WHO? According to Taiwanese officials, the country can use all the information it can get. Every scrap helps. So too, Taiwan has information, and experience, to share.In Taiwan so far, there have been 438 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and six deaths. Schools have been open since February 25—although with precautions—and professional sports are being played, without spectators.BONUS: Jay Nordlinger reviews the status of Taiwan, pathogen slayer and international pariah. In many ways, Goop is like any other celebrity cult. Yet it also reflects something more widespread, embodying many of the characteristics laid out in Christopher Lasch’s 1979 bestseller Similar to Markle, Paltrow was keen to discover a “point of life” that amounted to more than “making out with Matt Damon on screen, or whatever.” She began a newsletter called “The Goop Lab” in 2008. Since then, it’s developed into a $250 million company complete with a website, a podcast, a magazine, books, stores, and its own Netflix series of the same name. The Goop Lab, Paltrow explains in the first episode, is all about the “optimization of self.” Each of the six episodes explores a theme related to this: psychedelics, “cold therapy,” female sexuality, anti-aging, “energy work,” and psychic mediumship. Put simply, Goop is about “milking the sh** out of [life].”4. Madeleine Kearns checks out the rampant narcissism behind Goop. This will require some forbearance. In recent years, cities have become associated not only with standard Democratic politics but with a resurgence of socialist activism. America’s new socialists are clustered in cities, where blunt leftist “solutions” to the nation’s policy problems are taking root. These problems include slow middle-class wage growth after one accounts for the rising costs of health care, education, and housing near (increasingly urban) good jobs, along with climate change. The Left says “late” capitalism cannot adapt—and so transformation into the first phase of “democratic socialism” is nigh. Their remedy for stagnant wages and high living costs includes union empowerment, Medicare for All, free college, and bans on construction of private housing plus universal rent control. For climate change, the solution is a vaguely sketched yet massive Green New Deal. Seeing all this, conservatives may be tempted to leave cities to their own fate.While it remains too soon to say how big a factor urban density (as opposed to urban crowding) has been, people eager to use the crisis as an excuse to reject density should think twice. Dense cities offer capitalism’s solution to many of today’s challenges, from stagnant productivity growth to environmental degradation, in a package that conservatives should rally around.Population density is taking a beating as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Urban centers from Wuhan to New York City are hot spots for the virus, and many people argue, based on plausible intuitions, that urban crowding is to blame for its spread. Not all the evidence is in yet, and reassurances that New York could have prepared like (for instance) Seoul are, especially in the heat of the present, less persuasive to many than the mobile mortuaries humming around the city or the ongoing official use of the transit system as a homeless shelter. But cities have always faced serious challenges, and the economic and other benefits of cities are such that they have persisted for 5,000 years—even in the face of serious biothreats ranging from measles and flu to smallpox and plague.3. Alex Armlovich believes that conservatives should care about cities. Tragedy provides not reassurance but calm through the completion of a mechanical progression. Its end is probative, for it is the disposition of all the variables (the code) stipulated at its beginning—mathematically, there is no remainder.Drama acts similarly, engaging us in the assurance that the cause of all problems is evident, and that our reason will suffice to cure them. The Bad Butler did it; Deaf People are People, Too; Love Is All There Is; and so on. If we enjoy the mixture, it must (and will) be taken regularly.Psychoanalysis (and politics) attempts to address or capitalize on our human suggestibility, particularly on our frenzied willingness to assign our disquiets to another. Solutions offered thus flatter our ability to identify a problem, suggest its cure, and remind us to come back tomorrow for another dose.The human mind will and must assemble phenomena into cause and effect. We will intuit or ascribe a causal relationship to two events that, to another, have no possible connection: Aunt Edna did not call on my birthday because she’s furious I didn’t sufficiently praise her new frock; Germany is troubled because of the Jews; we are suffering a pandemic because Trump did or did not act quickly enough, and an economic disaster because he did.The technician might explain it technically, the musician employing the cycle of fifths, or the painter some theory of color or proportion, but this merely puts the problem at one remove. For, after the technical reduction, even the expert cannot quite answer the question of why: Why, for example, is the eye so pleased by the golden mean? Like any great truth, our understanding of art must devolve into metaphysics or an assertion merely leading to an infinite regression.Tragedy, to be compelling, must address a prerational experience or unity. A Hokusai painting of a wave makes us nod in recognition, as we do at a resolution of a Bach fugue. We cannot explain or dissect our experience of understanding, but it is undeniable. True art creates in us the same feeling of fulfillment, its possible description just beyond the rational mind.2. David Mamet — yeah, Around the same time, he fell under the influence of Joe Anderson, a business friend of his father’s. Anderson had gone to West Point and then served in Vietnam, where he had become the subject of a French documentary, As a teenager, he didn’t think much about politics. His parents were Democrats, but he dated a girl who belonged to the Young Republicans of Oakland County. So James attended their meetings, too. As he listened to members talk about personal responsibility, a culture of life, and defending the Constitution, he kept thinking: “That makes sense to me.” He didn’t become a Republican then, he says, but “it planted a seed.”That’s partly because John Edward James, who turns 39 in June, is a rare political type: an African-American Republican. His great-great-grandfather was born a slave in Mississippi, and he likes to chronicle a brief family history: “In four generations, we’ve gone from a slave to a sharecropper to a mason to a truck driver and now potentially to a senator. That is absolutely remarkable, not just for our family but for our country.” His piece of the story began in 1981, when James was born in Southfield, Mich. He grew up mostly in Detroit, and although he was raised Baptist, he went to high school at Brother Rice, an all-boys Catholic school in Bloomfield Hills. (Today, he attends a nondenominational church.)With the exception of Alabama, where voters probably will reverse 2017’s fluke election of Democrat Doug Jones, Michigan represents the best chance for a Republican Senate candidate to beat a Democratic incumbent in 2020. Polls already suggest a tight race, and James is sure to receive more attention and support than he did last time. “We’ll be there to push John across the finish line,” says Senator Todd Young of Indiana, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Flipping a Democratic seat may be reward enough for many Republicans, but the stakes in Michigan are in fact a lot higher: James could become the GOP’s next young superstar.1. JJM on JJ. It’s a must-read. It’s a really great issue, if you can take the word of This Opinionated Fool — but you should take it.

Bringing things into this century, Seinfeld does a so-so bit on cell phones (“When that battery gets low, you feel like your whole body is out of power”) that culminates with Jerry hurling himself flat on the stage of the Beacon Theater in Manhattan. Jerry is 66. He shouldn’t have to throw himself on the floor to get a laugh. At another point he does some business that involves twisting himself into his mic cord. Grueling stuff.Pop-Tarts, Jerry notes, can never go stale because they were never fresh in the first place. Every person in the audience has to be shifting in his seat. Er, were Cookie Crisp jokes ever fresh in the first place, Jer? “When they invented the Pop-Tart, the back of my head blew right off,” he says. “We couldn’t comprehend the Pop-Tart, it was too advanced!” That’s how Jerry launches an ode to shelf-stable pastry that lasts about as long as Forty years ago the man was making jokes about breakfast cereal. Today he’s making jokes about . . . Pop-Tarts. People who say “It is what it is.” Portable restrooms (“I don’t know how they’re even allowed to call it a bathroom”). Cup holders. Some of this stuff is so bland it deserves to be shipped out to Vegas.18. Now if only Jerry Seinfeld could make us laugh. Kyle Smith reviews a comedian gone stale. Here’s where Honoré reveals his objective: to investigate our culturally inspired desires. Hollywood’s remake mania merely cashes in on already established markets, with pre-sold properties and titles. We don’t grow from such copy-cat-ism, which means that American cinema’s ideas about morality, mortality, and existence become infantilized or politicized.Longing, regret, and passion materialize through different personages from the past. Every surprise appearance unpacks Maria’s subconscious — her numerous ex-lovers and, most vexingly, Irene Haffner (Camille Cottin), the piano teacher who was Richard’s first lover when he was age 15. Tellingly, even the ghost of Charles Aznavour appears as, he says, Maria’s “will.” He tells her “My role is to strengthen your resolve. Someone else handles your conscience.”This premise might immediately suggest Hitchcock’s Corrupt Hollywood now specializes in remakes and reboots and has convinced the public to accept this cheat as creativity. Meanwhile, Christophe Honoré counters that nonsense with his new film 17. In To the EU, the BVG’s intervention was both unwelcome and insolent. So far as the EU’s jurisprudence is concerned, EU law is supreme in every member state in a manner approximately analogous to the relationship between federal and state law in the U.S. In an English case from For half a century the conflict hinted at by this last question could One of the reasons that the euro zone has survived for as long as it has is the impressive ability of its leaders to postpone dealing with a series of questions that are as fundamental as they are inconvenient. Is it possible to sustain a monetary union without a fiscal union? (Probably not.) Is it possible to establish a fiscal union without genuine democratic consent? (We may yet find out.) And suddenly pressing: What is the relationship between the EU’s law and Germany’s?16. German jurists have put it at odds with the EU’s supremacy. Andrew Stuttaford explains. So what went wrong with the FBI is not the doing of its rank and file; it was failure of leadership. It will take both time and core changes to fundamentally alter the bureau’s orientation in the senior headquarters’s ranks. A few principles might help guide doing so.The damage wrought is not limited at all to misconduct seemingly aimed at the Trump presidency. What Comey and his cohorts did has harmed the work of the career FBI and Justice Department professionals whose interests Comey now disingenuously purports to represent and protect. If he cared about protecting the ability of those good people to do their jobs in a non-politicized atmosphere, he never would have usurped the function of prosecutors when he took it upon himself to both bar prosecution of Hillary Clinton in one breath and publicly condemn her conduct in the next — all done in the heated atmosphere of an emerging presidential campaign contest in which the FBI should have been decidedly a noncombatant. The dedication and professionalism in the daily work of thousands of FBI agents and support personnel in the field offices across the country is of critical value to the nation. Likewise, the federal prosecutors who take cases to court day in and day out are the tip of the rule-of-law spear. Together, the work of these professionals is the lifeblood of the justice system, and the vast majority of them perform at exceptionally high levels still. What Comey and his cohorts wrought, however, has made doing those jobs more difficult because public trust in the FBI and the justice system is eroded and questioned. The sunshine of the work Barr has commissioned to illuminate the truth is a disinfectant, not the disease; mistaking it as such because the facts have a collateral benefit to Trump is simply another mark of the hyper-partisan mindset.15. George Terwilliger has some suggestions for fixing the leadership-broken FBI. We’ve had lots of recent occasions to see China’s pettiness. The CCP made It’s no longer paranoid or irrational to ask these questions. This week, How much of what we hear from day to day is really just meant to please the Chinese Communist Party? When LeBron James said that Daryl Morey’s pro-Hong Kong comments were “either misinformed or not really educated on the situation,” had he engaged in a direct conversation with a Chinese dignitary or had the NBA merely relayed its concerns to him on China’s behalf? Did some officious CCP official get a pat on the head when the World Health Organization kept praising China’s response to the emergence of a new coronavirus in Wuhan before it declared a global health emergency? When Governor Andrew Cuomo started bizarrely referring to the coronavirus as the “European virus,” was he hoping to preserve Chinese investment in New York?14. Michael Brendan Dougherty sees occasional tough talk, but no real tough action, in Donald Trump’s dealings with the ChiComs. In the end, however, the quarantines proved difficult to enforce and ultimately unable to stop the spread, so inoculation emerged as the only real solution. But Washington faced fierce opposition. Inoculation was a grotesque procedure that involved first scratching the patient’s arm and inserting pus from a smallpox victim into the healthy person’s wound. This would cause the patient to contract a case far milder than if he were to inhale the virus or otherwise catch it more naturally. But he would enjoy lasting immunity.Despite being centuries of technological advancement behind us, our first commander-in-chief’s approach to the epidemic parallels today’s: Washington first moved to seal off his troops from foreign entrants, then he checked for symptoms within his camp and quarantined anyone suspected of being infected.Also like today, there were concerns that adversaries might use disease against us. The British intentionally sent infected prisoners back to American communities to spread the scourge. In fact, one British officer recommended, “Dip arrows in matter of smallpox and twang them at the American rebels.” (Guns and bullets were almost universal at this point; this measure was intended specifically to injure and infect.) Whether actively spreading the virus or merely taking advantage of its natural spread, Washington’s enemies sought to leverage America’s weakened state.Much like today, the virus not only sickened the civilian population but also ravaged the U.S. servicemen, leaving them vulnerable to enemy attack. During the Battle of New York City in 1776, the smallpox epidemic grew so dire that Commander-in-Chief George Washington described it as more dangerous than “the Sword of the Enemy.” And he was correct — for every soldier killed in battle, an estimated ten others died from disease.13. Logan Beirne tells of The Father of Our Country, fighting a war and a contagion. By the time the pandemic’s second wave subsided in early 1919, at least 45,000 residents of Massachusetts had succumbed. By the time a third wave of the epidemic ended in the spring of 1919, an estimated 500,000 to 675,000 Americans had died of the disease, in a period when the U. S. population was less than one-third of what it is today. In the U.S. Army, which sent more than a million soldiers to fight overseas in World War I, more personnel perished from the influenza than from combat wounds.Along the Atlantic seaboard and beyond, the pandemic spread with incredible speed and ferocity, assailing more and more of the civilian population. In Philadelphia, where the disease arrived via a visiting ship in September, hundreds of workers in the Navy Yard quickly became infected. Despite this warning sign, the city’s public-health director refused to cancel a scheduled Liberty Loan parade designed to raise money for the war effort. At least 200,000 people jammed the parade route on September 28. Within a week 45,000 residents of the city were stricken with the influenza. Within six weeks, 12,000 Philadelphians expired from it, the highest death toll for any American city.For a time in the summer of 1918, the pandemic seemed to peter out. Then, in late August — in Europe, the eastern United States, and a section of Africa — it returned in mutated form. This second wave was far more deadly than the first, and it spread like a silent tornado. Striking first at U.S. sailors in Boston Harbor on August 27, it soon found its way inland. According to the New England Historical Society, on September 8 it reached Camp Devens (about 40 miles from Boston), where 50,000 U.S. soldiers were stationed. By September 23 more than 10,500 of them were sick with the influenza. By the 29th, they were reportedly dying at the rate of 100 per day.12. George Nash, the conservative historian, puts the pandemic in perspective. I have been a teacher of American history virtually all my life, and if there is one lesson I have learned from all that, it’s to beware of historical explanations that come down to one single cause. Human events and motivations, like human relationships, are always more complicated than that, and a cause that claims to explain For that reason, the purpose of The follies of 11. Allen Guelzo whales on Only after all of this stuff did we learn that CNN has a new poll out, under the headline, “10.

Since 1983, U.S. policy has been to Last week, the United States Navy sent ships into the Barents Sea for the first time 9. The cold facts, as Jerry Hendrix explains them, all make the case for why the U.S. Navy must keep the Arctic Sea open. How can you parse such blatant injustice? How can you view perpetrators as the victims? The only way to do this is to believe, as the ACLU attorneys claim to believe, that the boys — declaring themselves to be female —Never mind that the two transgender athletes in question were born male and lived unambiguously as such until several years ago, when, in their late teens, they began socially “identifying” as females and competing with girls. Enabled by their state’s athletic conference, the pair have, between them, claimed 15 women’s state-championship titles and deprived countless more girls of the opportunity to participate in races and compete for scholarships.District Judge Robert Chatigny, during an April 16 conference call, In the latest installment of our dystopian black comedy, 8. Madeleine Kearns looks at the Connecticut trans athletes’ lawsuit and sees a need for chromosomal honesty. The basic problem is financial, not ethical. Many states already are spending more on their retirees than they are on current priorities such as higher education. So out of whack are the state pension systems that the Pew Trusts estimated their 2018 liabilities at more than $1.5 trillion. That doesn’t mean that $1.5 trillion would solve the states’ pension problems — it means that $1.5 trillion would get them to the point where their pension systems are broke rather than laboring under $1.5 trillion in unfunded liabilities. Even with those liabilities gone, the states would be required to continue to make ongoing pension contributions that are heavy today and only getting heavier. The question is: How much do you want to shortchange today’s first-graders and college freshmen in the service of tomorrow’s retired DMV clerks? Round your answer to the nearest That creates real problems. But those problems have almost nothing to do with the coronavirus epidemic and the subsequent economic shutdown. The cities and states have taken on some extra expenses during the public-health emergency, but the biggest effect on their finances will come from lost revenue. There is a case to be made (a reasonable one if not a completely persuasive one) for helping cities and states backfill some of that lost revenue in these extraordinary times, though leaders in states with more responsibly managed finances and well-maintained rainy-day funds object to subsidizing their spendthrift neighbors. That’s a question of “fairness,” which, in politics, means . . . whatever anybody wants it to mean.The so-called HEROES Act — and, please, please, please, can we finally stop with the sophomoric acronyms? — is another wish list from the House Democrats. It contains the usual Democratic wish-list items, one of the more expensive of which is a proposal to shunt vast streams of federal revenue into badly managed states and cities in order to buy them out of their self-inflicted financial troubles. More than $1 trillion of the $3 trillion package would be in the form of aid to state and local governments, with almost all of that money — $915 billion of it — in unrestricted cash. This will be a great boon to states and cities (largely but not exclusively Democratic) that have hamstrung themselves financially by promising government workers fat pensions and retirement benefits without actually spending the money necessary to fund those programs. States and cities generally cannot go into debt to finance regular operating expenses such as salaries (they do borrow money for infrastructure projects and the like), but they can effectively borrow from their pension systems by promising benefits in the future but using the cash today for other purposes.7. There’s nothing heroic about Nancy Pelosi’s latest multi-trillion-dollar pandemic-relief bill, says Kevin Williamson. Yet while Taiwan has embraced restrained, responsible statecraft, Beijing has poached Taiwan’s diplomatic allies, used economic leverage to punish Taipei, and engaged in dangerous military provocations with growing frequency. At a broader level, the cross-strait balance of power has shifted in Beijing’s favor thanks to a rapid rise in military spending, and General Secretary Xi Jinping has made clear his intent to annex Taiwan by whatever means necessary. The Chinese military threat to Taiwan is no longer a long-term hypothetical scenario. Rather, it is a dangerous course of action that gets more likely the less we stand up to CCP aggression.Unfortunately, support for Taiwan has been inconsistent. Unlike NATO’s crystal-clear Article V collective-defense commitment, the U.S. commitment to Taiwan has been muddled. Since the Carter administration, the United States has adopted a policy of “strategic ambiguity.” Once upon a time, proponents of this strategy may have told themselves that they were calming tensions by deterring It’s hard to have a more high-quality friend than Taiwan — a vibrant democracy under intense pressure that deserves our full support.6. Congressman Mike Gallagher wants the U.S. to have Taiwan’s back. Xu Zhiyong, Chen Qiushi, Fangbin, and Li Zehua are journalists, activists, and businesspeople. All have disappeared after their critical reporting about responses to COVID-19. Is your government investigating these disappearances? Why are state authorities investigating tycoon Ren Zhiqiang, who raised legitimate questions about how COVID-19 has been handled? Why has scholar Xu Zhang Run, whose concerns have been aired in this publication, been silenced? Was Dr. Ai Fen pressured by authorities after her reports on COVID-19?The Wuhan lockdown was declared on January 23, and Wuhan residents were prohibited from traveling to other parts of China. Why were many thousands still allowed to travel to other countries?Why has China, to date, refused international requests, including from the WHO, to undertake on-site investigations into the origin of the virus?5. Jianli Yang and Aaron Rhodes have a few questions for Qui Tiankai, Red China’s disinformation-spreading Ambassador to the U.S. China has funded Confucius institutes at universities throughout the world, ostensibly to promote knowledge of Chinese language and culture. However, U.S. officials have warned that the institutes essentially serve as propaganda outlets.“The Chinese government’s flagrant attempts to coerce and control discourse at universities in the United States and around the world pose an existential threat to academic freedom as we know it. It is a civic and moral imperative that we protect that freedom,” the The letter has been signed by the leadership of both the College Republican National Committee and the College Democrats of America, as well as numerous human rights groups committed to protecting Uighur and Tibetan minorities from persecution in China.In its first official act, 4.

For a while, it seemed like a New York governor would have a doctor arrested if he didn’t admit an elderly coronavirus-sufferer to infect a nursing home. Victor Davis Hanson considers the strange case of Andrew Cuomo . . . and Brother Christopher. What’s more, the larger context only makes all of these facts more damning. By 2016, the Obama administration’s intelligence community had normalized domestic spying. Obama’s director of national intelligence, James Clapper, famously It is not conspiracy-mongering to note that the investigation into Trump was predicated on an opposition-research document filled with fabulism and, most likely, Russian disinformation. We know the DOJ withheld contradictory evidence when it began spying on those in Trump’s orbit. We have proof that many of the relevant FISA-warrant applications — almost every one of them, actually — were based on “fabricated” evidence or riddled with errors. We know that members of the Obama administration, who had no genuine role in counterintelligence operations, repeatedly Democrats and their allies, who like to pretend that President Obama’s only scandalous act was wearing a tan suit, are going spend the next few months 2. Yes indeed, says David Harsanyi, the Obama administration was engaged in serious corruption. Those are the kinds of questions a responsible judge would be posing, not, “How do I sentence this guy if DOJ won’t prosecute?” Regardless of what the DNC and CNN have to say on the matter, Flynn is supposed to be presumed innocent as far as Judge Sullivan is concerned.Lest we forget, the primary function of the federal judiciary is There is no complex legal issue to be resolved. DOJ’s dismissal motion may be politically controversial, but legally it is pro forma. The only branch of government constitutionally authorized to proceed with a criminal prosecution is the executive. The Justice Department has declined to prosecute. There is nothing for the judge to do besides the ministerial task of ending the case on the court’s records.1. Everything you wanted to know about Judge Sullivan’s wildly partisan decision, but were afraid to ask, courtesy of the expertise of Andrew C.

Surely, the correct comparator here is not a female employee fired for keeping the female dress code, but a female employee fired for The funeral home has the stronger case. There can be no dispute that, in 1964, the original public meaning of “sex” was anatomical and biological. Senator John Tower, who opposed the Act, stated the following during Senate debate on the topic of definitions at the time: “These terms are not defined. The term ‘sex’ is not defined, but I believe we can probably reason that that means an applicant is a man or a woman.” It is difficult to believe that the prohibition on discrimination “on the basis of sex” extended to the kinds of differentiation between the sexes that remain standard practice in millions of workplaces (e.g. separate restrooms and dress codes). Nevertheless, activists in originalists’ clothing, the ACLU attorneys have adopted a twofold strategy of sophistry, using “sex” interchangeably with “gender identity,” and kicking up dust with a secondary argument regarding sex “stereotyping.”In October, the court heard oral arguments from the ACLU that Aimee Stephens, formerly Anthony, who had worked for six years at a funeral home in Detroit area, had been discriminated against on the basis of “sex,” prohibited under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Representing the funeral home, attorneys from the Alliance Defending Freedom argued that Stephens had not been unfairly discriminated against, but rather was fired for refusing to comply with the company’s sex-specific dress code.1.

The key factor, however, is that in most places, human-caused pollution is small relative to natural sources. Even a significant reduction in the human contribution makes only a small difference.In Dallas, the levels of PM 2.5 are higher than average. In Boston, they are slightly lower.In Philadelphia, a city health commissioner said, “I would expect our air pollution levels will probably go down because the number of vehicles in the streets are less.” Recent particulate-matter levels, however, have been close to the five-year average.According to the In my hometown of Seattle, one environmental activist told You’ve surely already heard that claim, and surely also wondered — this is just another case of liberal smog, Before too long an uber-woke, granola-and-hemp aficionado, emerging from the throes of a prolonged ecstasy occurring deep inside the recycled-material interior of her off-the-grid tiny house, weeping bulbous tears of joy on her vegan-nourished pure-bred retriever, swooning with glee over humanity’s deserved abuse at the hands of a pathogen, will milk her schadenfreude and write an essay for Dear National ReviewFollow Us",0,"Welcome Sulfur Dioxide, Hello Carbon Monoxide"

Phil Kerpen is the president of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity and the co-editor of its Hotline. </em>Colorado has taken the lead. Baisley lit the fire, and Polis stepped up to exercise genuine leadership. All governors, Republican and Democratic, should follow his lead and report both sets of numbers. And the CDC should fix its nonsensical definition — which didn’t even exist until March 24 of this year.But if we don’t fix the definition, residents of nursing homes (which are now being tested wholesale for coronavirus) who have mild or asymptomatic infections will show up in the COVID-19 death count when they die from any of the maladies from which people die. The median nursing-home stay before death is just five months. If this definitional problem isn’t fixed, the tallies will lose all contact with reality, with attendant public panic and additional economic hardship.There is no doubt this virus flashed through nursing homes with devastating effect. We have cataloged the death toll in The number of deaths among people who died from COVID-19: This represents the total number of people whose death was attributed to COVID-19 as indicated on a death certificate. This number is determined by the CDC and is updated daily for dates through the previous Saturday.The number of deaths among people with COVID-19. This represents the total number of deaths reported among people who have COVID-19, but COVID-19 may not have been the cause of death listed on the death certificate. This information is required by the CDC and is crucial for public health surveillance, as it provides more information about disease transmission and can help identify risk factors among all deaths across populations.Beginning May 15, the department began reporting the number of deaths in two ways:This language appeared Friday on the state’s website, along with the new numbers:The numbers differ considerably. At the time of Colorado’s announcement on Friday, the CDC-definition tally, used in CNN’s “dashboard” and all the other media reports, stood at 1,150 statewide. But only 878 of those, more than 23 percent less, are identified as deaths due to COVID-19.Democratic governor Jared Polis could have circled the wagons. But to his enormous credit, he ordered the state to publish the two different numbers. He told CDPHE came under more fire when they added the death of a 35-year-old man who died of alcohol poisoning, who happened to be coronavirus-positive, to their official tally. Their defense was simple: They said they were just following the CDC definition. “We classify a death as confirmed when there was a case who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) laboratory test and then died,” CDPHE said in statement.Republican state representative Mark Baisley accused the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) of Except we know they were not.Oddities, all, we were told. “Aberrations.” Insignificant to the overall count.Last week, there was the In April a 37-year-old California man “died as a result of a drug overdose while infected with COVID-19, a significant contributing condition, according to county spokeswoman Ashley Bautista, per the

Counting in this way results in a decline of 23 percent in reported COVID-19 deaths. What’s going on here?We now know more about what she was talking about, since Colorado has become the first state to publish two different numbers.

No charge.<strong>ADDENDUM</strong>Of course, if those draconian methods don’t really stop the spread of the disease . . . then the Chinese government is giving its people the worst of both worlds. Orwellian surveillance, sweeping restrictions on daily life, . . . but if draconian methods keep people alive, who’s to complain, right?The industrial city of Shenyang in neighboring Liaoning province is requiring visitors from Shulan county to undergo a 21-day quarantine on arrival, according to state broadcaster CCTV.In Shulan county, which is under the city’s jurisdiction, train service has been halted until the end of the month.Residents of the province’s Jilin city must show certificates of health, including a recent negative nucleic acid test, if they wished to leave the city, state media reported.No doubt, leaders in Beijing would like the world to believe that their heavy-handed quarantine methods are the most effective. (They unleashed the problem upon the world, and they get to show the world the best solution.) Sure, Overall, at least 22 infections spread across three cities in two provinces — Jilin city and Shulan in Jilin province, and Shenyang city in Liaoning province — have now been linked, making it one of China’s biggest clusters that has emerged in months.These six people had contact with another cluster in the adjacent city of Shulan, which was earlier put under lockdown, suggesting that some amount of undetected spread has already taken place before.Jilin city, the second-largest city in Jilin province, saw bus and rail services halted and residential compounds closed off last week after the discovery of six new cases of infection. Recently reopened schools were closed again.How is China’s fight against the virus going, as far as we can tell through state-controlled media? Nowhere near as bad as the initial outbreak in Wuhan, <strong>Meanwhile, in Northern China . . .</strong>And that would be particularly intriguing in light of the report that there “But if a significant number of athletes who competed in Wuhan, and who have avoided contact with potential carriers since then, test positive for antibodies . . . that would strengthen the argument that the virus was floating around Wuhan much earlier than we currently believe.For what it is worth . . . some German, French, and Italian athletes who competed at the games have Back on April 22, <strong>A Curious Report about October’s World Military Games in Wuhan</strong>There is no word on who was walking Pompeo’s dog at the time.In another demonstration of growing Chinese power in Hong Kong, “But the pro-democracy camp said the move was a coup, citing the legal opinion of the legislature’s own lawyers.On Monday, the pro-Beijing camp installed its own committee chair, armed with an external legal opinion saying they had the power to end the deadlock.Pro-democracy lawmakers have used filibustering to stop voting for a new chair.The committee has been without a leader since October, meaning no bills have made it to the legislature for a vote, including the national anthem bill.It was the second time in two weeks that clashes have broken out as pro-democracy supporters try to kill a bill that would ban insulting China’s national anthem.. . . Another day of chaos inside the city’s House Committee, a body that helps scrutinize bills, with protesting pro-democracy lawmakers dragged from the chamber by security guards and scuffles between rival camps.There is good reason to believe that the Chinese government sees the global pandemic as an opportunity. With almost every government of every country in the world attempting to get a handle on the outbreak, China is free to make moves that otherwise would bring international rebukes. <strong>A Pandemic Is a Convenient Time for a Power Grab</strong>One flaw in the The magazine quoted Germany’s foreign intelligence agency, BND. Der Spiegel also claimed the BND concluded up to six weeks of time to fight the outbreak had been lost because of Chinese stalling. WHO said Dr Tedros and Mr Xi “have never spoken by phone” and added that “such inaccurate reports distract and detract from WHO’s and the world’s efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic”.The UN agency said a German magazine’s report about a telephone conversation between WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Chinese President Xi Jinping on January 21 was “unfounded and untrue”. Der Spiegel reported that Mr Xi asked Dr Tedros during the call to hold back information about human-to-human transmission of the virus and delay declaring a pandemic.For what it’s worth, the “That’s the calculation you make,” said the person familiar with the discussions.Tedros knew there was a risk of upsetting China’s political rivals with his visit and his public show of support, according to the person familiar with the discussions — an account backed by a WHO official. But the agency chief saw a greater risk — in global health terms — of losing Beijing’s cooperation as the new coronavirus spread beyond its borders, the two sources said.“We knew how it was going to look, and he can sometimes be a bit naive about that,” the person said. “But he’s also stubborn.”The advisers encouraged Tedros to use less effusive language out of concern about how he would be perceived externally, the person familiar with the discussions said, but the director-general was adamant, in part because he wanted to ensure China’s cooperation in fighting the outbreak.After meetings with President Xi Jinping and Chinese ministers, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was impressed by their knowledge of the new flu-like virus and their efforts to contain the disease, which by then had killed scores in China and started to spread to other countries.There is some indication that WHO management beyond director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus are starting to feel some pressure. Some of the staffers around Tedros appear to be offering their own We can all see the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We’re living in it.

But human bodies’ immune systems kill coronaviruses all the time. Our experience with the number of people who recover from SARS-CoV-2 with mild symptoms demonstrates that some human bodies’ immune systems can kill Because most coronaviruses are not deadly and generate symptoms on par with the common cold, there’s been less incentive to put lots of research into developing vaccines for them.

The inquiry, supported by the U.S., could send international inspectors to Wuhan. China has vehemently rejected the proposal, saying it is an attempt by the Trump administration to blame China for the pandemic and shift attention away from its own mistakes.“China supports the idea of a comprehensive review of the global response to Covid-19 after it is brought under control, to sum up our experience and address deficiencies,” Xi said. “This work should be led by science and professionalism, led by the WHO and conducted in an objective and impartial manner.”Xi added that China supports a full review of the global response to the coronavirus.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month the U.S. “strongly believed” China flouted World Health Organization rules by neglecting to report on the outbreak in a “timely fashion,” and did not report on the community spread of the virus “for a month until it was in every province inside of China.”The U.S. intelligence community concluded in a classified report that China deliberately provided incomplete public numbers for coronavirus cases and deaths resulting from the infection.“We have shared control and treatment experience with the world without reservation,” Xi said in his speech. “We have done everything in our power to support and assist countries in need.”Xi also defended his country’s handling of the pandemic, which has been sharply criticized by U.S. officials and other countries, insisting that China has been prompt and transparent in sharing information about the virus with the WHO.Additionally, the Chinese president said a vaccine for the virus “will be made a global public good” when it becomes available and added that countries must “continue supporting global research by scientists on the source and transmission routes of the virus.”The funds, which will be distributed over two years, are intended to “help with Covid-19 response, and with economic and social development in affected countries, especially developing countries,” Xi said at a convening of the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization.China’s President Xi Jinping said Monday that China will contribute $2 billion in aid to combat the coronavirus in other countries as the world’s second largest economy works to repair its global image after the pandemic spread beyond its borders.National ReviewFollow Us",0,China Announces $2 Billion Coronavirus Aid Pledge during WHO Meeting

No charge.How the administration worked through this and got to a better place would seem an interesting story, if the press weren’t too vehemently opposed to Trump to even consider occasionally giving some credit where it’s due.He explains that during the worst period, “people, hospitals, point-of-care, were getting supplies on the numbers-of-days amounts instead of, ‘Hey, I want like a month, two months.’”  He says he can understand how this just-in-time allocation method “would make you feel uncomfortable,” adding that as supplies were focused on hot spots, “other areas of the country that did not have such significant COVID outbreaks certainly got less of an allocation and were fed as needed.”Polowczyk says that he believes every place that needed PPE got it, although he had “the unenviable job of managing scarcity as we went through March into April and now May, where the volume of supplies has increased.”<strong>Credit Where It’s Due?</strong>This is a signal contribution to what Admiral Polowczyk calls the “expansion” phase of the supply effort, enhancing the U.S. manufacturing capacity for the long haul.Meanwhile, 3M has been ramping up domestic production even further, on the strength of orders from the federal government. 3M is slated to produce 50 million respirators in June, up from 22 million a month prior to the crisis. Then it will produce 74 million in July and 94 million a month by October 1.According to FEMA administrator Gaynor, over last month 42 flights carrying nearly 44 million FEMA-procured masks and respirators from 3M have landed in the U.S.The procedure is that FEMA takes custody of the material in China and becomes the importer of record, flying it back to the United States. Initially, it took the company and FEMA three hours over the phone to work out the finer points of the logistics of these flights. Now, it has become so routine that coordinating each flight takes more like 10 minutes.This opened the spigots. The deal would secure 166.5 million respirators for the U.S. in the course of April, May, and June. “That’s more than anyone has sourced ever,” says the senior administration official.That was just a start. More ambitiously, as the White House official explains, “we signed a contract with them for those [Shanghai] masks, and then we went to the Chinese government and said, ‘We have a contract with the company.’”Typically, 3M sells almost all its respirators produced in the U.S. to American distributors, and all of its respirators in China to Chinese distributors. The respirators in its Shanghai factory could have possibly become another source of supply to the U.S., but Beijing had been requisitioning all that production. 3M on its own got China to allow 10 million to be brought to the United States.From early on, 3M embedded a contact with FEMA to facilitate the relationship and provide expertise on the masks.Seeking to get more masks into the health sector, the company flipped its production entirely over to medical needs, whereas it usually produces for both medical and industrial users. Meanwhile, the FDA issued a so-called emergency use authorization to allow different types of respirators to be used in a hospital setting.3M is the only significant domestic manufacturer of N95 respirators. It had relatively recent experience with what a pandemic does to a supply chain during the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. The company had surge manufacturing capacity that it turned on as the coronavirus crisis developed, maxing out at about 100 million N95 respirators per month in mid-February, double its usual global output.<strong>From Shanghai to U.S. Hospitals</strong>What no one has pointed to is any case where the volunteers and FEMA gave a contract to someone not genuinely suited to deliver quality product. Indeed, one of the administration’s most significant actions has involved forging a close relationship with the very opposite of a fly-by-night operator, the multinational conglomerate 3M.The Stories in the press routinely allege political favoritism. If a lead came in from, say, a member of Congress, he or she would be apprised of where it stood (if this hadn’t happened, the critique would have been that the administration wasn’t communicating). If any lead was ultimately forwarded on to FEMA, the volunteers would check on where it stood. But officials involved in the effort insist that every lead went through the same funnel and was evaluated the same way.“Without doing thorough vetting,” says the HHS official, “we would have ended up in a place that many other folks have ended up in, of purchasing low-quality goods, which I don’t think has really happened.”Only after those four steps would the information be packaged together and sent over to FEMA for the final procurement decision.Someone from the FDA would make sure that the product could be used in America. Someone from the State Department would check to see if it could be exported from the country that it was in. Then, using the existing network of distributors overseas, a site visit would take place to examine the materials and make sure they were as advertised.If a lead passed muster, then it went through a series of hoops before anything happened.It wasn’t as though the volunteers examined and adjudicated every lead on their own, either. They’d do the initial vet — asking, for instance, if the broker knew what manufacturing facility the material was coming from. If the answer was “no,” it was a sign that the broker wasn’t what he seemed.The HHS officials says that it was “very similar to the work they were doing in the private sector,” comparable to kicking the tires on early-stage companies — “figuring which ones are legitimate, which ones have legitimate management teams, legitimate customers.”One main line of attack against the volunteers is that they were inexperienced. Obviously, they weren’t experts in government procurement. But, largely drawn from the world of consulting and investing, they had done relevant work performing due diligence on businesses.Sifting through the leads was a gargantuan task, given the sheer volume and how many were dubious. “There was a lot of messy stuff there — a lot,” says the senior administration official.<strong>Separating the Wheat from the Chaff</strong>The administration settled on a path between full nationalization, with the potential disruption that would have brought, and business as usual.The senior administration official considers the counterfactual of leaving the companies to fend for themselves. “What would have happened is you have these distributors that sourced all these supplies; they were theirs,” he says. “They all would’ve come over by boat, and it would have taken three weeks to get here, and then they would just be distributed to hospitals based on their customer relationships.”If the government wasn’t going to nationalize the supply-chain — for understandable reasons — it wasn’t an alternative to let companies operate under standard procedures either.But what was the alternative? To let desperately needed gowns take months to get here from Vietnam? To wait until DuPont relocated its entire supply chain in the United States, obviating any need to grapple with shipments to and from Asia?A critical A It’s also said that Project Airbridge should have used Department of Defense planes. “When you use a DOD plane, it’s super expensive and slow,” the senior administration official explains. “You generally don’t want to use military aircraft unless it’s absolutely necessary.”A number of criticisms are lodged at the project. One is that the federal government is subsidizing the distributors by paying their transit costs. But another way of looking at it is the government got an enormous amount of PPE where it wanted it to go, without actually buying it — just paying to fly it here.Since March 29, there have been 139 Project Airbridge flights, bringing in a mountain of material.FEMA also has its own metrics, drawing on FEMA, HHS, and CDC data streams, for where the PPE is needed most. It has concentrated the allocation on roughly the 100 hardest-hit counties.To get visibility into the supply chain, FEMA mustered the data of the companies. Polowczyk says FEMA fashioned “six disparate business systems into one visualization tool to make data-informed allocation decisions.” According to Polowczyk, FEMA can track material as it comes in from suppliers, what’s being held in inventory, and what’s being delivered, down to the county and the customer level.The government-driven allocation was important. Distributors were feeling pressure to send stuff to their largest customers, which weren’t necessarily in the hardest-hit areas.FEMA worked with the top six medical distributors — Cardinal Health, Owens & Minor, Henry Schein, McKesson, Medline, and Concordance — covering about 90 percent of facilities in the country. It contracted with FedEx and UPS for the flights. “We made FedEx and UPS our Air Force,” says the White House official. FEMA didn’t actually purchase the materials, but allocated 50 percent of it to the places that needed it most (the other 50 percent fed facilities elsewhere, which still needed the gear for more routine work and to prepare for COVID-19).The answer was flying them instead, cutting the transit time from more than 30 days to less than two.A senior administration official recalls everyone thinking at the time, “We’ve got all these things that have been procured by distributors, but they’re going by boat, and we need them today.”The impetus for the initiative was simple: Supplies we needed right away were in Asia, and it would take it them three weeks to get here via ship, the standard means of transport.<strong>The PPE Airlift</strong>This pointed to a cooperative arrangement with companies, using their existing operations, knowledge of the market, and real-time data, while at the same time redirecting supplies to hot spots — and doing it as quickly as possible.The Defense Production Act has still come into play; it’s been invoked 14 times, according to Gaynor, for PPE and other equipment. “Our goal,” he says, “has always been to supplement not to supplant America’s PPE supply chain.”Besides, the market players were hardly recalcitrant.  “Nobody needed coercion,” the White House official says. “Everyone was willing to step up and do what was right.”It wasn’t considered feasible to nationalize the entire supply chain under the Defense Production Act. We’d “have to figure out where every single piece of equipment is going to go, and where every single thing is going to be distributed,” a HHS official explains. “So the amount of information that you would need and the amount of judgment you would have to be making about where things were needed was going to be exceptionally high.”At the outset, HHS was the lead agency but, as a White House official notes, it is more of a policy than an implementing agency. The supply-chain effort would be moved to FEMA, which is routinely involved in execution. States are also used to dealing with it.Right from the beginning, everyone realized that the strategic stockpile alone couldn’t possibly cover what we needed in the crisis, and that the most sought-after supplies were overseas. “We had outsourced most of the medical supply chain to Asia,” as Polowczyk puts it.<strong>Don’t Nationalize Companies, Work with Them</strong>Oh.Another passage in the A senior administration official scoffs at how the New York went ahead and awarded him a nearly $70 million contract and got exactly nothing for it. This is indeed a story of haste making waste — although one that implicates New York State, not the federal government.The   
     
   After the story appeared, Hendricks said it “did not fully reflect my experience.”This wasn’t earth-shattering information, given that many tipsters said exactly the same thing. According to the A large, quintuple by-lined A typical journalistic tack has been to find someone who had a frustrating experience with the administration and make him representative of the entire effort.They might make promise to various potential buyers and then pull the rug out from under them when they get a higher bid, explaining that the situation is out of their control because FEMA swooped in and took the material. Gaynor is emphatic that “FEMA does not have the authority to conduct seizures.”Stories in the press have The administration has been urged Senator Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has <strong>Kitchen-Sink Attacks</strong>The story of what they’ve done is a key part of the administration’s response, even if it has been obscured by a press that has an allergy to anything that has worked.A team around White House adviser Jared Kushner and the supply-chain task force under Admiral Polowczyk worked to fly supplies from overseas to the U.S. quickly, to vet leads for additional PPE (the work of volunteers from the business world mustered by Kushner’s team), and to build a cooperative relationship with 3M, the country’s most important manufacturer of N95 respirators.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>None of this happened by accident. At a time of unprecedented stress on the supply chain and a yawning gap between supply and demand in the market, it required considerable clever improvisation and determined hustle. This was not your average bureaucratic response. It was a partnership between the public and private sector to get supplies to the United States on an urgent basis and ship them to the places that needed them most, and then begin to ramp up manufacturing here at home.According to Admiral John Polowczyk, head of the supply-chain task force at FEMA, we manufactured roughly 30 million N95 respirators domestically a month before the COVID-19 crisis. He says we are on a path now to ramp up to 180 million N95 respirators a month.This is manifestly false. In a briefing for reporters last week on FEMA’s work securing PPE, FEMA administrator Peter Gaynor laid out the raw numbers: FEMA, HHS, and the private sector have shipped or are currently shipping 92.7 million N95 respirators, 133 million surgical masks, 10.5 million face shields, 42.4 million surgical gowns, and 989 million gloves.Any government response to a once-in-a-generation crisis is going to be subject to legitimate criticism, and there’s no question that almost every major government in the Western world, including ours, should have acted sooner.

No charge.“We need operational concepts like air, land battle — that were developed during the Cold War, with respect to the Soviets — given the very complex and complicated nature of the threat posed by the Chinese government,” Cheney says. “We need to have new concepts to think through: How do we deter China? How do we deter their aggression? How do we ensure that we have the capability to prevail, so we never have to use it?”Of course, that doesn’t mean Republicans think an armed conflict is inevitable down the line — Stewart, for one, calls such a conflict “extremely unlikely.” But bilateral tensions with China don’t seem poised to ease any time soon, and task-force members are adamant about the need for strong military deterrents.Gallagher is convinced of the need for allies in the fight against China because he’s convinced that Beijing represents an existential threat akin to the one once posed by the Soviet Union. “I think we are in a new Cold War,” he says. “I think we’re at a position similar to where we were in the late ’40s [and] early ’50s, and it’s going to require us to modernize a lot of our government structures and nongovernment structures in order to win this competition.”“The way I’m starting to think about it, as a way to avoid descending into autarky, is: How do we harness this very healthy ‘Made in America, Decouple from China’ sentiment into closer and more creative partnerships with our allies?” Gallagher says. “That’s one area where I think the task force could do a lot of good, is identifying the areas where we really have an opportunity to work with our friends and partners on the world stage.”Still, the possibility exists that the pandemic will result in heightened levels of American isolationism, complicating efforts to more aggressively limit China’s global reach. Last month, President Trump “The Belt and Road Initiative is part of a larger geopolitical strategy — it’s not just about building up their military, it’s not just about their cyberspace, hacking activities, or their ambitions in outer space — it is the fact that they have global ambitions,” Barr adds. “That is on full display, by exerting influence over these lesser-developed countries. Now in this task force, we need to seriously evaluate U.S. policies at these international financial institutions and how we use our influence in these international financial institutions to contain and counter Chinese ambitions.”“When the dust settles from this, we know that China is going to walk into a bunch of countries with a bunch of cash and countries are going to have a decision to make: Do you take the immediate kind of heroin hit, the feel-good cash, and then find yourself addicted to China later?” Kinzinger asks.<span class=""drop"">T</span>“The first thing I did was warn everybody about making this a partisan issue,” says task-force member Adam Kinzinger (R., Ill.) of the group’s opening call. “Right now, it’s an 80 percent, probably 100 percent [bipartisan] issue — but we can make it 40 percent real quick and do nothing and look back in 20 years and be like, ‘Was it really worth it for an election?’”“I think as you look at individual pieces of legislation, you’re likely to see bipartisan support for holding China accountable, things like requesting that Taiwan be able to be an observer at least at the WHO activities,” Cheney says. “I think you’ll see, on substance, many Democrats joining with Republicans to support holding China accountable.”“There’s a lot of Democrats who really do feel the same way that we do on these issues, and a real easy one is the pharmaceuticals,” task-force member Chris Stewart (R., Utah) argues. “Show me anyone in Congress who thinks it’s a good idea for us to get 97 percent of our generics [from China]. No one thinks that’s great. . . . Well, there’s a really easy bipartisan area, that’s significant, that we can work together on, but you got to come work with us on the task force.”There is reason to be hopeful that such a consensus can still be reached. McCarthy and McCaul still want input from across the aisle, and a House GOP source says that bipartisan “staff-level discussions” have been initiated with Democratic leadership, without elaborating further. Moreover, some task-force members believe there is appetite for strengthening the nation’s China policy across the aisle.“Look at the creative partnerships you’ve seen in Congress: You have card-carrying members of ‘the Squad’ like Ilhan Omar supporting legislation that’s very tough on the CCP for treating the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang — and in doing so, echoing a lot of the rhetoric of Marco Rubio. So I think it creates a lot of strange bedfellows, and I think that’s positive,” Gallagher says. “We have an opportunity to really build a bipartisan consensus around how we compete successfully with the CCP without descending into McCarthyism.”Despite that apparent setback, Republicans say that they remain committed to ensuring that the task force has the broad support required to be a success.House sources say that, following months of back-and-forth negotiations, an agreement was reached in February to launch “the China Policy Coordination Group,” consisting of four Democrats (Representatives Eliot Engel of New York, John Larson of Connecticut, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, and David Trone of Maryland) and four Republicans (current task-force leader Michael McCaul of Texas, Reschenthaler, Darin LaHood of Illinois, and Elise Stefanik of New York). But a day before the scheduled launch on February 25, Republicans claim, Democrats pulled the plug. (Democrats did not return requests for comment on the task force or on their concerns over China’s growing influence.) <span class=""drop"">T</span> “My biggest professional challenge in the last 26 years of combined military and intelligence experience has been the information-sharing stovepipes, and the inability of people to look beyond their own mission set, and I think that’s something that we have to fix now,” Representative Denver Riggleman (R., Va.), a longtime NSA contractor and Air Force veteran, says.While China’s handling of the pandemic makes the task force’s mission all the more urgent, the need to confront China was clear to many of its members long before the first COVID-19 case emerged.“It never has been free trade, or free exchange, or free markets with China,” says Representative Andy Barr (R., Ky.), another task-force member. “Anyone who says that that’s the effort that has been tried over the last couple decades, they’re sorely mistaken. We have not had free trade with China. It’s been American companies, bullied by China, having their intellectual property seized and stolen by China, no fair competition, or free competition. It’s been American and Western businesses taken advantage of and pushed out of free competition by virtue of no labor regulations, cheap labor, and state subsidies of industry.”“In working on many of the trade issues, you realize pretty quickly that all of the major issues are intertwined,” task-force member Anthony Gonzalez (R., Ohio) says by email. “Technology transfers, trade abuses, international institutional influence, and the like are all part of a broader strategy to displace the United States as the world leader and place Xi Jinping and the CCP at the top of the global pyramid.”The rhetoric marks an implicit rejection of a longstanding bipartisan consensus: the notion that American free-market engagement would gradually liberate the Chinese people. Instead, Republicans argue that the opposite has happened: The CCP has chewed up and spit out foreign investment to serve its own interests.While the China Task Force is focused on a number of different issues, it is united by a belief that Beijing poses a unique threat to U.S. interests — a challenge, its members say, that Washington has yet to seriously grapple with. “There was certainly a lot of hope, during the Clinton administration, during the Bush administration, during the Obama administration, that [China’s] behavior would change, but it clearly hasn’t,” task-force member Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) says in a phone interview.<span class=""drop"">I</span><span>NOW WATCH: </span>“We need to have a wakeup call about China’s influence into many aspects of American life, much of which Americans aren’t aware of,” Representative Michael Waltz (R., Fla.) says.As the country’s response to the coronavirus dominates the airwaves, the task force wants China’s malign intentions and growing capabilities to take center stage.In justifying their desire to reorient American foreign policy toward containing the Chinese Communist Party, task-force members need only point to recent history, whether it be China’s hack of the Office of Personnel Management in 2015, its brutal treatment of Uighur Muslims, or its crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong last fall. But for some, the issue runs deeper. “Growing up in western Pennsylvania, I have seen China’s transgressions firsthand, including their efforts to undercut U.S. steel manufacturers, export deadly opioids into our communities, and steal American’s intellectual property,” task-force member Guy Reschenthaler (R., Pa.) says in an email.More than a decade later, Gallagher credits that same officer — the current deputy national-security adviser, Matthew Pottinger — with helping shift his focus 3,000 miles further east. As Pottinger helps steer the White House through the coronavirus pandemic, Gallagher is one of 15 House Republicans joining the China Task Force, a group that aims to provide a comprehensive reassessment of America’s relationship with China.<span class=""drop"">D</span>

No charge.We have to shift back to normality very soon, or prepare for a season of rancor and disruption as that social contract that applies to most of the children in this country gets stretched to a breaking point.The product of both parochial and public education, I’m neither a public-school hater nor a diehard supporter. And I expect the schools to survive long-term, given how much has been invested morally and financially into the system itself. But this medium term makes no sense.It’s not just the schools either. Social services, early intervention, and any number of things done for the development of children have had to shift to simulations mediated by screens. In most cases, parents have adjusted to these substitutes begrudgingly as yet one more inconvenience of a temporary emergency. But patience is running out.And if I have to take the time to gather all the materials for every lesson and make sure all my children’s activity is logged, if I have to sit next to them while they do their school work to make sure they are connected and properly muted or unmuted, then I’m taking on almost all the personal costs of homeschooling while getting none of the benefits of it. Those benefits include determining the time and content of lessons, the books we use, the online tutors I hire, the friends that work with us, the pace that we go, and the days we are off.Somehow distance learning makes it seem that parents are the employees of the teachers, who are deemed the true educators of children. The teachers and schools still have the power to declare students truant or to fail them for not keeping up. But those teachers and schools are incapable of providing anything like the same kind of service in exchange for that power. It doesn’t help the case for the teachers that The public-school social contract also may come under much pressure in the fall. NPR says that schools serve other functions than education, including “child care for millions of working parents.” But if the schools aren’t accountable for children for five to seven hours a day, then they may be subject to the same considerations that have college administrators trembling about their budgets. Right now, the dominant public mode among parents is one of support. In my own district, teachers recently enjoyed a supportive, socially distanced parade. Can that last?<span>NOW WATCH: </span>NPR’s headline warned that “Some parents want the teachers to conduct a class over teleconferencing software for four hours a day, to give them time to work. Other parents resent even as little as half an hour of online instruction when their own work-from-home and child-minding schedules are being improvised daily.But what about K–12 public schools? The social contract of a public school requires a certain kind of uniformity of expectations from teachers’ unions, students, and parents. But, under COVID-19, every term of that social contract seems up for grabs.Much has been said about how colleges will struggle and some will close as a result of COVID-19. America’s aging and declining in fertility. More schools chase after fewer students. The moment that schools try to charge for the premium college experience while delivering a CD-ROM-level education over the Internet, the weaker ones will fall apart.<span class=""drop"">I</span>

In New York State, that figure is 140 according to the As New York State became the coronavirus capital of the Western world, with more deaths than any country except the U.K. and Italy, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 dashboard, the media’s praise of Cuomo grew ever more lavish, and Cuomo’s approval ratings have (consequently) been sky-high. Today a reckoning is overdue for the disastrous results of Cuomo’s policies.What may turn out to have been Cuomo’s worst unforced error was his March 25 order that nursing homes must accept patients who carried the coronavirus. This now looks like setting off a series of time bombs in New York State’s elder-care facilities, and Cuomo didn’t reverse this policy until May 11. The governor protested at that time that only 12 percent of New York State COVID deaths had occurred in nursing homes, but we are now learning that many people who died after falling ill in nursing homes have not been counted in the official stats. One such facility reported seven COVID deaths to the state, the   
     
   The state and the city continued to work at cross purposes behind closed doors. “The state Health Department broke off routine sharing of information and strategy with its city counterpart in February,” In New York, the public is today the victim of Cuomo’s longstanding, bizarre, petty, counterproductive hostility toward his fellow Democrat de Blasio. Though de Blasio publicly stated on March 17 that a shelter-in-place order might be necessary, and said so gingerly so as not to poke the bear, Cuomo fired back that it wasn’t necessary and that only he had the authority to give such an order. Privately he derided de Blasio as offering a scenario more befitting a nuclear apocalypse, according to In San Francisco, in early March, Mayor London Breed was issuing a series of orders restricting large public gatherings. She ordered residents to shelter in place starting on March 16 and sent details of her shutdown order to de Blasio, thinking he might need to follow suit. Under orders from Governor Gavin Newsom, California shut down on March 19.How were other states handling the outbreak? On March 1 on the other side of the country, officials were raising the alarm rather than telling people everything was fine. Launching the first phase of social distancing on March 1, in greater Seattle, King County officials held a conference call with 19 of the region’s large tech companies, including Microsoft and Amazon, and urged them to tell employees to stay home if they could. On March 4, Seattle officials said everyone over 60 should stay home and everyone else should work from home if they could. By March 5, photographs of highways typically clogged with rush-hour madness in Seattle showed sparse traffic instead.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>On March 6 Cuomo insisted, “The overall risk level of the novel coronavirus in New York remains low” and Summing up, Cuomo said, “Once you know the facts, once you know the reality, it is reassuring and we should relax because that’s what’s dictated by the reality of the situation.”Like de Blasio, who as late as March 10 was on MSNBC telling New Yorkers that most of us were at little to no risk and that the coronavirus was much like seasonal flu, Cuomo persisted with his don’t-scare-away-the-tourists happy talk well into March, the critical month. On March 1, the day New York State logged its first confirmed case of the coronavirus (a health-care worker who had just returned from Iran), Cuomo assured everyone that, although one of his own daughters had called him in a state of panic, there was no need to be afraid. “The facts defeat fear. Because the reality is reassuring. It is deep breath time. . . . This is not our first rodeo with this type of situation in New York,” Cuomo boasted, adding, “Excuse our arrogance as New Yorkers,” but the state was fully prepared. “We don’t even think it’s going to be as bad as it was in other countries,” he said. “We’re going to have a special effort for our nursing homes, et cetera, congregate facilities where senior citizens are being treated.” He further boasted that the state had broken free of federal restraints about testing: “Now we are actually in control of the systems ourselves. And as New Yorkers we like control.”New York and New Jersey combined have suffered more COVID-19 deaths than any other <span class=""drop"">B</span>

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>This doesn’t completely eliminate the possibility of the virus emerging from the wet market . . . but it’s another piece of counter-evidence. This study points in the direction of a human being who had the virus coming to the market and spreading it, not some undercooked bat or pangolin.<strong>ADDENDUM</strong>I suspect my readership is far too smart to ever take an unacceptable risk, but just in case you know anyone who’s a quart low in the common-sense department, One of the extraordinarily frustrating aspects of this public argument is the number of people who insist chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine must be either a wonder drug or absolutely useless; a disturbing number of people cannot seem to grasp that a treatment could work for certain patients in certain circumstances and not others.Krieg, founder and chief scientific officer of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, a Cambridge, MA-based startup developing immune treatments for cancer, says he’s particularly worried about health care workers and others who may try these drugs outside of clinical trial. Without a trial, he says, they won’t know if the drug is actually increasing their risk of severe infection.“My concern about the drug in the pre-infection state or the infected state is that they block the innate immune pathways that may allow the immune system to detect virus and to start a response against it,” says Art Krieg, who has spent decades studying this process. He sees both drugs as likely to be more useful to treat late stages of the disease, as has been done in China and elsewhere.From Yes, I’ve seen the arguments that hydroxychloroquine helps the body absorb zinc, resulting in a stronger immune system; I’ve read the medical journal articles; one of the central takeaways, which I relayed in an Even though the letter from Sean Conley, physician to the president, only says “I guess we’re all arguing about hydroxychloroquine again, huh?<strong>We Pay More Attention to What Trump Says Than to What Trump Does</strong>You may recall James Griffiths, a producer and commentator at CNN, writing at the end of April that China had handled the outbreak better than the United States, The assembly kicked the can down the road on the question of whether to allow a delegation from Taiwan attend as an observer. You could make the argument that Taiwan has handled the pandemic better than anyone: “The fact that there appears to be no serious talk of replacing Tedros is a clear sign that despite It is difficult to get too excited. WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, will still be the one ultimately responsible for overseeing the investigation that will review his own actions.

Apparently not: “Five months after the outbreak, the initial epicenter has just 5 or 6 percent exposure?“Lots of people in China have no background immunity and would be at risk if there is a second wave,” Mr Hui said.While strict lockdown measures in China’s outbreak epicentre Hubei province helped break the chain of local transmission, people in cities like Wuhan could be vulnerable to a second wave of infections because there is a low level of antibodies in the population. A study of 11,000 residents of Wuhan in April found that 5 to 6 per cent tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, Caixin reported last week.<a href=""https://www.todayonline.com/world/warnings-second-wave-covid-19-infections-china-fights-long-term-war"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Then there’s this study of Wuhan residents, suggesting that achieving “herd immunity” would take a long, long time to complete:</a>At some point soon, the Chinese government is going to declare that they have a vaccine.

No charge.The public knows all that too, and even in the hardest-hit places, is beginning to insist on returning to the normal pace of human activity. Trying to stop it would be like trying to stop a river from flowing. Going forward, the government should focus on empowering, informing, and encouraging the general public while assisting the high-risk demographics who remain isolated. That’s the best and most balanced strategy, and in reality the only viable strategy, for minimizing the total harm that the virus will cause over the life of the pandemic.What I am saying is that those measures belonged to the initial phase of pandemic response, which is, basically, over. The balance of risk has changed substantially over the last two months. The government now knows, to the extent we know anything about COVID-19, that a large part of the population is at extremely low risk and that many people have already had and recovered from the disease and therefore have a large measure of immunity going forward. It also knows that the danger that hospitals will be overwhelmed by severe cases, while still present, is much less than was feared in March.I want to be very clear that I am not saying the extreme measures were unwise. I supported them when they were taken, and I believe they produced many benefits; and even if we eventually conclude they were not necessary, or not necessary to the extent they were imposed, the leaders who imposed them made the best decisions they could in the fog of uncertainty that pandemics always produce.That’s starting to happen now, and it is increasing public discontent across the spectrum. The more risk-positive part of the population is angry that the extreme measures are still in place, and the more risk-averse people are angry that the measures aren’t being enforced. There is a real and growing possibility that continuing the de jure shutdown will end up alienating just about everybody.Finally, extreme social-distancing measures are very difficult to enforce even for a short time, and harder still to enforce after the visible need for them begins to disappear. Once the urgent necessity recedes, people start to circulate whether the government likes it or not, which then tends to create the worst of all worlds: The quarantine measures are not obeyed well enough to significantly reduce disease transmission, but their very presence continues to stifle the economy, cause social dysfunction, and reduce the credibility of the public authorities who try to enforce them.It’s hard to focus on the really urgent aspects of pandemic response when, for example, government resources are being diverted Another problem with extreme measures is that they divert the attention of authorities from focusing on the most urgent threats posed by the disease. Two months ago a pandemic expert — a longtime friend whom I respect greatly — told me that his biggest fear was that COVID-19 would get into nursing homes. That fear has been realized, in part because in many places inadequate steps were taken to protect that population. One of the reasons for that failure may have been that authorities were distracted by the difficulties of maintaining restrictions over the whole population.There are a lot of reasons for that besides the economic deprivation that obviously accompanies any severe shock to the economy. For one thing, such measures I’ve spent a considerable part of the last 12 years warning the government about It all reminded me of an axiom of pandemic response that, until the day before yesterday, public-health experts felt free to acknowledge without being considered heartless: that general quarantine or shutdown measures are at best a clumsy and inefficient tool with rapidly diminishing benefits and rapidly increasing costs.I had just finished reading Mario Loyola’s National ReviewFollow Us",0,Ending the Lockdowns and the Question of Political Sustainability

No charge.It is bad enough that we have a judicially manufactured and court-enforced regime of unlimited abortion, removing the abortion debate from the hands of the people and their legislators. It is another thing entirely to have a Congress that can’t even acknowledge the problem with forcing every American to underwrite it.The battle Republicans continue to fight over Hyde is the wrong one. The alternatives on the table at the moment are either to directly reimburse abortion providers for the cost of performing abortions or not to do so. But there remains an undiscussed alternative: cease providing federal funds to any organization that performs abortions, whether in a relief bill or otherwise. Doing anything else is, practically speaking, the same as funding abortion.The best solution to this consistent problem is the simplest one: Stop federally funding abortion altogether. The Hyde Amendment is a small win for pro-lifers, as far as it goes, and if it is our only option, it shouldn’t be abandoned. But it’s not our only option.Legal abortion on demand is so enshrined in our policy landscape that the question of federally funding it is now a major sticking point any time Congress has to fund anything related to health care (and now, apparently, businesses). While these fights expose the Democratic Party’s unswerving dedication to taxpayer-funded elective abortion, the average observer likely has little idea that Democrats are willing to hold up a stimulus bill over abortion funding, because media outlets routinely cover these debates from the opposite angle — think, “Republicans obstruct stimulus bill to block funding for women’s health care.”But the showdown looming in Congress over whether Planned Parenthood should be eligible for stimulus money — or, more specifically, whether Congress should apply the Hyde Amendment to ensure that stimulus money does not directly reimburse the cost of abortion procedures — illustrates one of the fundamental problems with federal abortion policy.There is no reason in the world why this organization should be eligible for coronavirus-relief funding, since it has demonstrated no particular difficulty in remaining open during the pandemic to continue profiting from abortion (and doing precious little else).As stay-at-home orders went into effect across the country, the websites of local Planned Parenthood affiliates began to Despite routinely classifying itself as a health-care provider, Planned Parenthood has failed to offer any actual health care during the pandemic and has in fact merely ramped up its provision of abortion. In Pennsylvania, for instance, the organization shuttered all its health centers but kept open all its clinics that perform abortions. The president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, the group’s Colorado affiliate, said that its abortion numbers “have been pretty extraordinary” during the pandemic and cited an increase in women traveling from out of state for an abortion.Meanwhile, there is little evidence that the pandemic has created any financial problem for Planned Parenthood or prevented its affiliates from conducting their abortion business as usual. In several states, “reproductive health care” was explicitly classified as an essential service, and Planned Parenthood clinics were permitted to remain open and fully functional. In states that classified abortion as nonessential, Planned Parenthood joined other abortion-advocacy groups in swiftly suing to block those rules — and in most states, they won.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Aside from the obvious conscience violations involved in underwriting abortion providers and covering elective abortion, it should be fairly clear that Planned Parenthood is not in fact a small business and therefore should not qualify for small-business loans. According to its most recent financial report, Planned Parenthood had total net assets close to $2 billion and total revenue of about $1.7 billion last fiscal year. More than one-third of that revenue came from government reimbursements and grants, well over half a billion dollars.The legislation likely wouldn’t pass the Senate as it is, and the White House has already signaled that President Trump would veto it, but Democrats are determined to force the issue.But Democrats are ready for another attempt, and the latest iteration of the new stimulus bill in the House includes no Hyde Amendment language. As it stands, the legislation would permit state and local governments to disburse their portion of stimulus funding to abortion providers, make Planned Parenthood eligible for small-business loans, and include elective abortion in subsidized health-care coverage for furloughed workers.In earlier phases of the relief bills, Republicans successfully blocked nonprofit organizations set up as affiliates — a category that ostensibly includes Planned Parenthood — from receiving forgivable small-business loans. The previous legislation also included Hyde Amendment language, barring federal funds from directly reimbursing providers for the cost of elective abortion procedures.<span class=""drop"">T</span>

We should be thankful to those who’ve spent the last few months hammering home the “testing, testing, testing” mantra, because their efforts have yielded real, positive results. But testing was always going to be only part of the puzzle. At the end of the day, it’s likely that there remains a long road ahead of us.This would be a significant improvement, but we wouldn’t be out of the woods! We’d still have to practice social distancing as needed, minimize our time spent in enclosed spaces with lots of strangers, probably wear masks, and remain concerned about the elderly and the immunocompromised. Sporting events, concerts, conferences, campaign rallies, and other events involving large crowds would still be discouraged. The harshest restrictions of the quarantine would be gone, but we wouldn’t be back to “normal,” if by “normal” one means “where we were before the virus hit our shores.”Picture an America where, by the end of summer, those in high-exposure jobs are being tested twice a week, and those less likely to be exposed are tested once every two weeks. The vast majority of those who test positive agree to self-quarantine for two weeks   
   Early on in the outbreak, a Then there’s the question of how well people will self-quarantine after being informed of a positive test result. The good news is that most people mean well, don’t want to spread the disease, and will generally follow a doctor’s instructions. But even well-informed individuals can conclude that they know best and make reckless decisions. Back in 2014, NBC News’ chief medical correspondent, Nancy Snyderman, traveled to Liberia to cover the Ebola outbreak, and a photographer on her team caught Ebola. Snyderman was supposed to remain in her home for 21 days upon return. She left her house and   
   What’s more, even assuming that the new, quicker tests are reasonably accurate and enough of them can be produced to go around, a test can only tell you whether or not someone had the virus at the time the sample was taken. If a test conducted on Monday comes back negative on Thursday, the patient could still have caught the virus on Tuesday or Wednesday. Ideally, we would be testing regularly or even frequently, but members of the public are likely to lose patience with the process of having a swab jabbed far up their noses on a regular basis. One of the Abbott’s ID NOW COVID-19 test is designed to give results in five minutes. Quidel’s, as noted above, is meant to give results in ten. Some studies have argued that the error rate on the quick tests is higher. Abbott contends that those conducting the studies waited an hour or two between collecting each sample and testing it, and So far, so good: Our testing capacity continues to increase, and we have a general idea of who should be tested regularly once it’s feasible. But big questions still remain.Once the highest-priority personnel are covered, we will probably want to move on to all of the essential workers in supermarkets, pharmacies, agribusinesses, warehouses, and other companies operating through the pandemic. (Two easily overlooked categories: 
All of these numbers sound large, until one remembers that there are roughly 253 million American adults. Thankfully, we won’t need to get everyone tested all at once. Our priority will be sufficient regular testing for those at the highest risk of exposure: medical doctors and hospital staff, emergency medical technicians and ambulance crews, policemen, firemen, and just about anyone else whose job requires them to interact with the public a great deal. Considering the terrible toll of the virus on nursing and assisted-living homes, their residents and staff should also rank among the highest-priority groups.The supply of tests has grown to the point where places such as The Bath Iron Works shipyard is manufacturing more specialized machines so that Start with the good news: The U.S. has a lot more tests to work with than it did a month ago, and the supply of tests is continuing to expand.

But COVID-19 aside, the drug doesn’t “kill people.” It saves people. The fearmongering isn’t helping anyone.Now, it should be noted that there are all kinds of side effects to commonly used drugs. Take, for instance, the anti-wrinkle drug Botox, which not only comes with a laundry list of warnings but has also been known to spark botulism symptoms that “I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group, and in his, shall we say, weight group: ‘Morbidly obese,’ they say,” The conscientious way to cover Trump’s hydroxychloroquine usage would be to point out that there’s no proof that the drug will help treat the coronavirus, though tests are still ongoing. Instead, we are subjected to an overwrought lecture series of nasty, childish, partisan attacks and misleading stories about a couple ingesting fish-tank cleaner.Not a single one of these agencies says hydroxychloroquine “will kill you.” That would be asinine. What the FDA recently noted is that there are So he is not taking something that his own administration has said will kill you. That his own FDA said will kill you. That the [Department of Veterans Affairs] said will kill you. … That’s what doctors will say, too. The FDA said, take it if you’re in the hospital or take it if you’re in a closely watched clinical trial. But, don’t take it unless you’re under those two circumstances. So the president is not taking it, and yet, and yet, he’s telling Americans that they should take it.The most reckless media personality on the issue has been Trump’s former bestie, Joe Scarborough, who repeatedly told his audience this morning that hydroxychloroquine will “For that matter, we’re often lectured that killing an unborn baby is a decision made solely by a woman in conjunction with her doctor.

Singing should be avoided, they say, and Communion should be received in the hand, with younger priests or ministers preferred in distributing Communion.“I just can’t see for any clear scientific reason why preparing food for a thousand people in a restaurant is any safer than people going to Mass,” he added.“If you should have best practices for a grocery store and for a Home Depot, why can’t you have best practices for church services?” said Dr. Andrew Wang, an immunobiologist who is helping to guide clinical research into the virus at Yale.In interviews, the doctors emphasized that churches should be regarded as essential partners in rebuilding society in the wake of the pandemic, and said there are reasons to believe churches can do an even better job protecting people than other institutions in society.…“I believe that churches can be just as safe, if not at times safer than so-called ‘essential businesses,’ provided they take the precautions that are recommended in this document,” said Dr. Anushree Shirali, a nephrologist at the Yale University School of Medicine who has been treating coronavirus dialysis patients since the pandemic broke out in March.In a document published on theA blue-ribbon panel of Catholic doctors from some of the nation’s top research hospitals and universities says churches should be able to reopen “as safely as other essential services,” after being shut down for more than two months due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.There’s a new document from Catholic doctors at some top-ranking institutions offering guidelines to Catholic bishops on how to get people to Mass.

					© 2020 National Review				Our Capital Letter email newsletter delivers a weekly digest on finance, business, and economics from an NR sensibility.We do nothing to aid the cause of workers, managers, vendors, suppliers, and consumers by pretending against all logic and economic sense that these companies would be guaranteed success if only it weren’t for greedy investors and lenders — the greedy investors and lenders who believed in them and gave them a second chance. If you want a world of more iconic brand bankruptcies, root for the world the Sophisticated investors understand this and, moreover, seek capital structures that work for their individual investments. If politicians, who are outside observers encouraged by journalists and academics (two more sets of outside observers), start to issue top-down rules determining the correct capital structure for companies in which other people are supposed to put their own money at risk, it will not only lead to grotesque misallocation of capital; it will eventually lead to no allocation of capital. Those leading and financing Neiman Marcus may very well have made all the right decisions over the years, and simply run into capitalism’s creative destruction, not to speak of the damage inflicted by COVID-19 and the efforts to combat it. Or they may have made mistakes, and the new capital injected and the new investments made may have been inadequate to compensate for those mistakes. Opinions will differ over what went wrong. But no one can be happy to see an iconic American brand succumb, not least of all the private-equity investors who had much to gain from its success, and much to lose from its failure.Michael Milken famously But yes, the private-equity sponsors who made the 2013 purchase now face the unfortunate reality of bankruptcy for their failed investment. Of course, before this happened, they attempted to bring the company public (in 2015, the heart of the economic recovery). Public markets were not biting. The risk was held by private-equity companies, and the creditors who had extended them debt (and by way of a basic reminder of how capital structure works, the creditors are paid first; the equity holders are paid last). The underlying inference in the The broader accusation is that private-equity companies are seduced by the big brand names of high-fashion retail and the cash flows these businesses are supposed to generate, while underestimating the costs of investing in their long-term development. Yet as noted in the article, it was private equity that believed in Neiman’s story in 2005, and then profitably sold it in 2013 to two new private-equity companies (and there was a little thing called “the great financial crisis” in between those two dates). Several private-equity sponsors put their money at risk in the company, managed its balance sheet and operations through a sustained economic recession, and sold it to new investors at a billion-dollar profit in less than a decade. Winners all around, not the least of whom were the employees and managers of Neiman Marcus. But, for the sake of argument, imagine that the new debt was not an improvement in terms, that (say, and to oversimplify) it carried an interest rate of 7 percent, compared with the old debt’s 6 percent. Is that the end of the story? Not necessarily. What if the prior creditors had been about to seize that company, and the new recapitalization gave it the chance of a new life? It seems odd to throw mud at investors who gave a company the opportunity to survive, even if that rescue bid did not ultimately work out. The writers of the article take aim at private equity for not equipping Toys “R” Us to compete in a changing retail environment. “It did not have sufficient funds to invest in its stores and e-commerce business during a crucial period of growth for Amazon and Walmart,” they say. The writers of the I am not holding my breath. The vilification of private equity by politician<span>NOW WATCH: </span>The cases of J. Crew and Neiman Marcus are nuanced, as is any private-equity investment. To understand why and how an investment was structured requires detailed examination of the investor, the investee company, and the deal’s terms and conditions. To say after the event that a “company died under the weight of its interest expense” is a tautology. All companies fail when their debts and ability to service them exceed their assets and ability to utilize them. I look forward to reading an article that says, “Company ABC dies after years of paying excessive taxes,” or, perhaps, that “after 20 years of 20 percent annual growth in health-care costs, company XYZ shuts its doors.”Any commercial enterprise so careless with the future of the companies in which it invests will not stay in business long, will not draw investor interest for long, and would not even get meetings with companies it is pursuing for long. In short, it would not have much of a business. If my goal in life were the death of the private-equity industry, I would be rooting for it to structure more leveraged buyouts in which the investee company went bust. That would surely hasten the outcome for which I longed.To start with the most basic of basic principles, equity investors lose money when a company goes bankrupt, and therefore they have every incentive to help it avoid that fate. That a significant amount of the capital that goes into a leveraged buyout — an acquisition where a high percentage of the cost is financed by debt — is borrowed money is by definition true. But buttressing every debt investment (which is, after all, an infusion of capital into companies that desperately need it for their growth, repair, and survival) is a layer of protective equity — the skin-in-the-game money that authors of articles such as this don’t seem to take into account. The argument that those who, as a result of owning the equity (or a large portion of the equity), have a significant stake in the profit if the company in which they have invested does well are prepared to risk that upside by structuring the company’s capital in a way that jeopardizes its prospects or even its continued existence seems counter-intuitive.Underlying the article’s thesis is an oft-repeated misunderstanding surrounding private equity — that the investors and sponsors have already made so much in fees and interest out of the deal that it really doesn’t matter too much to them if a highly leveraged investment ends in bankruptcy. The thesis has been repeated so often that it is frustrating to have to constantly refute it. But its repetition has helped embed it in American consciousness, and it is the duty of those who value truth and basic financial literacy to keep explaining why this analysis is faulty.The often sensationalist coverage may or may not have always been sincere, but it has been consistent. So it was not altogether surprising to <span class=""drop"">T</span>

No charge.Florida is certainly not exempt from future outbreaks — missteps by a government official or facility staff member could retard the state’s apparent progress, and it’s possible that, as testing continues to expand, the numbers will change and the mortality figures will reveal DeSantis’s approach to be suboptimal. But as of now, the data show that DeSantis has handled this pandemic better than governors in the northeast, and to say that the nursing-home crises those states face were an inevitability discounts the very real decisions that produced them.
While the AARP and other groups have criticized Florida governor Ron DeSantis for failing to implement a universal testing regime in nursing homes, he has persisted in administering random tests in the state’s 4,400 LTC facilities on a voluntary basis, deploying a group of National Guard personnel when a facility has a positive case. As of last Wednesday, National Guard medics had completed over 30,000 tests. DeSantis has also instituted a mobile testing lab that travels from facility to facility, capable of administering up to 3,500 tests a day. The state’s testing regime has not been perfect — it took the DeSantis administration, like other state governments, a Florida’s LTC facilities have had a different coronavirus experience. While the state’s response to the pandemic has been much maligned in the media — photos of “In New York, a similar series of executive missteps led to a higher-than-average coronavirus-mortality rate in nursing homes and LTC facilities. Governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters that the virus spread like “fire through dry grass” in the state’s nursing homes, which is an apt analogy. Nevertheless, Cuomo instituted guidance on March 25 that stipulated “no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to a nursing home solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.” Operating on the same premise as New Jersey, Cuomo ironically further imperiled his state’s hospital capacity by putting the “fire” of COVID-19 patients in the “dry grass” of nursing homes. While he changed the policy earlier this month, the damage was done: New York has the fourth-highest COVID-19 mortality rate per capita in LTC facilities as of May 13, and the staff and residents of Executive mismanagement exacerbated these preexisting deficiencies.

Perhaps this is so. Most of us broadly affirm the inherent worth of those two populations, but it is difficult to dispute that our day-to-day decisions as individuals and as a nation do not always reflect our stated priorities vis-à-vis their well-being. It merits mention, though, that we effectively shut our economy down in hopes of preventing the spread of a virus that poses limited threat to the young for the sake of the aged and sick. Further, Camosy’s claim that the current nursing-home crisis was the inevitable result of our reliance on such facilities ignores the fact that Italy’s elderly, who by and large live with their families, <span class=""drop"">I</span>

No charge.“I view it more as a badge of honor that I was doing a good job,” DeSantis says, “and that they viewed me as a target, because if I wasn’t, they probably would just ignore me.”Perhaps things will still go wrong in Florida, perhaps its relative good fortune can be chalked up to weather, perhaps county-level lockdowns made a big difference, but no one can say that the state hasn’t taken a thoughtful approach to the crisis. Or, no one can reasonably say that — which, of course, hasn’t stopped many journalists.“Our 13 drive-through sites in the state of Florida, we can do about 10,000 tests a day, just on those sites,” he says. “And we obviously have so much more testing going on in hospitals, doctor’s offices. But we can do 10,000 tests a day, and we average about 5,000 people that actually come to test. So we have a surplus of availability.”Looking ahead, he says, “being measured and being thoughtful and just following data is important.” He’s not following the advice of some people to, as he puts it, “just rip off the Band-Aid and just go whole hog.” In looking at the cases every day, there are cases in prisons and nursing homes, but “outside of southeast Florida, we’re not seeing a huge amount of community transmission, which is a good sign.” Of course, testing will continue to be a priority, as it has been all along.He thinks that the relatively short, relatively capacious shutdown order has allowed Florida to be ahead of the curve of reopening of the more restrictive states. DeSantis maintains that “what we did in March and April is the equivalent of what New York will be or California, when they go to phase three.”He was relaxed from the beginning about outdoor activities, even as critics sounded the alarm about the beaches: “I always believed that respiratory viruses were less likely to be transmitted in a hot outdoor environment, and then you started to see the studies come in, in March, saying that that’s what it was.”DeSantis eventually did issue his own statewide order, but he argues that it was more flexible and less prescriptive than those of other states. “We had a broad essential-business definition,” he says. “So we basically had businesses operating. We had the daycares open, we had recreation open, and my order never actually closed any businesses. We allowed them to operate within the context of just limiting contact between people outside the household.”And understandably so: “Even at this point, 60 percent of our cases have come from just those three counties. I mean, they represent 29 percent of the population, but 60 percent of the cases, and certainly a majority of the fatalities and hospitalizations.”“We worked with the locals in Southeast Florida,” he continues. “They had more restrictive measures than the rest of the state.”“I said from the beginning,” DeSantis explains, “we’re a big, diverse state. The epidemic is not going to affect this state uniformly, and what’s appropriate in Miami and Broward may not be appropriate for Jacksonville or the Panhandle. And that’s pretty much the way we did it.”At the same time Florida was devoting enormous attention to nursing homes and establishing highly restrictive policies to protect them, it was giving its counties latitude in how they reacted to the crisis.Finally, it has established several COVID-19-only nursing homes, with a couple more in the pipeline. The idea, again, is to get COVID-19-positive residents out of the regular nursing homes to the maximum extent possible.The state has also started a sentinel surveillance program for long-term-care facilities, routinely taking representative samples to monitor for flare-ups.The state has just deployed a mobile testing lab in an RV that has a rapid test with results in an hour or two. It goes to a community and the staff goes to different long-term-care facilities. “If you’re talking about an asymptomatic carrier, if you can identify that person instead of waiting 48 hours for lab results to come back, I mean, that could be the difference between saving a lot of infections,” according to DeSantis.Most facilities haven’t had confirmed cases. “But the ones that have,” he says, “the majority of them have had between one and five infections. So the infections are identified, but then, you’re isolating either the individual or the small cluster before you have an outbreak.”When the state was seeing infections at nursing homes presumably caused by staff, DeSantis deployed what he calls “an expeditionary testing force,” 50 National Guard teams of four guardsmen together with Department of Health personnel that tested staff and residents.As the health officials put it, succinctly, “We wanted people out, not in.”At the other end of the equation at the nursing homes, the state made it clear, according to Mayhew, “if you are unable to adhere to these infection-control standards, if you are unable to safely isolate and dedicate staff to an isolation wing or unit, you need to transfer that individual to a hospital.”“What we said constantly is let’s not have two cases become 20 or five become 50,” she continues. “If you don’t manage this individual as you return them back, you will have far more being transferred back to the hospital.” Early on, when tests had a slow turnaround, there was a lot of pressure to give way, but Mayhew was unmovable on the question.Mary Mayhew had daily calls with the hospitals, with people involved in discharge planning on the line. “Every day on these calls,” she says, “I would hear the same comments and questions around, we need to get these individuals returned back to the nursing home. We drew a hard line early on. I said repeatedly to the hospital, to the CEOs, to the discharge planners, to the chief medical officers, ‘I understand that for 20 years it’s been ingrained, especially through Medicare reimbursement policy, to get individuals in and out. That is not our focus today. I’m not going to send anyone back to a nursing home who has the slightest risk of being positive.’”It’s impossible to overstate the importance of this insight, and how much it drove Florida’s approach, counter to the policies of New York and other states. (“I don’t want to cast aspersions on others, but it is incredible to me, it’s shocking,” says the Florida health official, “that Governor Cuomo [and others] are able to kind of just avoid real questions about their policies early on to actually send individuals into the nursing home, which is completely counter to the real data.”)Florida fortified the hospitals with PPE, too, but DeSantis realized that it wouldn’t do the hospitals any good if infection in the nursing homes ran out of control : “If I can send PPE to the nursing homes, and they can prevent an outbreak there, that’s going to do more to lower the burden on hospitals than me just sending them another 500,000 N95 masks.”Florida, DeSantis notes, “required all staff and any worker that entered to be screened for COVID illness, temperature checks. Anybody that’s symptomatic would just simply not be allowed to go in.” And it required staff to wear PPE. “We put our money where our mouth is,” he continues. “We recognized that a lot of these facilities were just not prepared to deal with something like this. So we ended up sending a total of 10 million masks just to our long-term-care facilities, a million gloves, half a million face shields.”Inspectors and assessment teams visited nursing homes. The state homed in on facilities where, Mayhew says, “we had historically cited around infection control. We used that to prioritize our visits to those facilities, understanding that the guidance from CDC was changing frequently. So our initial focus was to be an effective resource education to provide guidance to these facilities to make sure they understood how to request personal protective equipment from the state.”But the nursing homes represented a different level of risk. “It was clear to me,” says Mary Mayhew, “that there were much higher standards related to infection control being outlined by the federal CDC that well exceeded what our nursing homes traditionally have been expected to adhere to. So we never had false expectations.”The state took precautions with its seniors generally. “We advised, before there was even mitigation,” DeSantis points out, “if you’re 65 and older, stay home as much as possible and avoid crowds. And that was just something that made sense.” The state talked to senior communities like The Villages about what they were doing to mitigate risk, and they took common-sense measures, such as stopping big indoor gatherings.Here, Florida is indeed quite vulnerable. The state has roughly 350,000 residents and staff at more than 4,000 long-term-care facilities.His focus has been on “clinically significant cases,” or serious cases that might require hospitalizations, and that pointed to the nursing homes.The Florida Department of Health produces a report that DeSantis sees every morning: new cases, number of tests, positivity rates, etc. He also gets a rundown of the people who have gone into hospitals and of ICU usage. He can follow the key indicators down to the county level. This allows granular visibility into what’s happening. He cites the example of rural Hamilton County. It had 67 cases the other day. DeSantis was able to call the surgeon general of the state to find out what was going on, and learn it was an outbreak in a prison rather than a wider community spread.  
   Florida was better able to do that than many states because of its routine experience dealing with natural disasters. “Many states simply did not have the data infrastructure that Florida has,” says Mary Mayhew, secretary of Florida’s Agency for Healthcare Administration. “We have an emergency status system that gets stood up, as I mentioned, in the case of a hurricane. Hospitals and nursing homes and other long-term-care providers are required to submit data on a daily basis, twice-daily basis, regarding their bed availability.”The DeSantis team also didn’t put much stock in dire projections. “We kind of lost confidence very early on in models,” a Florida health official says. “We look at them closely, but how can you rely on something when it says you’re peaking in a week and then the next day you’ve already peaked?” Instead, “we started really focusing on just what we saw.”  
   “So I was very concerned about things on that side as well,” he continues, “and I think that’s why I had a more nuanced and balanced approach than some of the other governors. Because you have some of these health officials saying, ‘You’ve got to do this. This is science,’ or whatever. But really, these were unchartered territories.”He was hesitant about sweeping lockdowns, given that there wasn’t much of a precedent for them. “One of the things that bothered me throughout this whole time was, I researched the 1918 pandemic, ’57, ’68, and there were some mitigation efforts done in May 1918, but never just a national-shutdown type deal,” he says. “There was really no observed experience about what the negative impacts would be on that.”Then there was Italy: “I think a lot of the policymakers in the U.S. acted like Italy would happen in the United States, but when you look under the hood of Italy, there were huge differences, and there were reasons why that part of Italy fared as poorly as it did. I think the median age of fatality was something like 82 in some of those areas in Northern Italy. So we looked at that, but that really helped inform the strategy to focus most of our efforts on the at-risk groups.”At the outset, DeSantis looked at South Korea’s experience: “I just thought it was so dramatic, the extent to which this was concentrated in the older age groups. I think the first real fresh set of South Korea numbers I looked at, I think it had no fatalities under 30, and then 80 percent of them were 70 and above or something like that. It was really, really dramatic.”So how did DeSantis go about responding to the epidemic? It began with the data, and trying to learn the lessons of other countries.Perhaps more understandably, The Villages, the iconic senior community, was a focus of media worries. According to DeSantis, as of last weekend there hadn’t been a single resident of The Villages in the hospital for COVID-19 for about a week. At one point, the infection rate in The Villages was so low that state officials were worried that they were missing something. “So I got the University of Florida to do a study,” he says. “They did 1,200 asymptomatic seniors at The Villages, and not one of them came back positive, which was really incredible.”<span>NOW WATCH: </span>DeSantis is bemused by the obsession with Florida’s beaches. When they opened in Jacksonville, it was a big national story, usually relayed with a dire tone. “Jacksonville has almost no COVID activity outside of a nursing-home context,” he says. “Their hospitalizations are down, ICU down since the beaches opened a month ago. And yet, nobody talks about it. It’s just like, ‘Okay, we just move on to the next target.’”The media didn’t exactly have their eyes on the ball. “The day that the media had their first big freakout about Florida was March 15th,” DeSantis recalls, “which was, there were people on Clearwater Beach, and it was this big deal. That same day is when we signed the executive order to, one, ban visitation in the nursing homes, and two, ban the reintroduction of a COVID-positive patient back into a nursing home.”An irony of the national coverage of the coronavirus crisis is that at the same time DeSantis was being made into a villain, New York governor Andrew Cuomo was being elevated as a hero, even though the DeSantis approach to nursing homes was obviously superior to that of Cuomo. Florida went out of its way to get COVID-19-positive people out of nursing homes, while New York went out of its way to get them in, a policy now widely acknowledged to have been a debacle.The conventional wisdom has begun to change about Florida, as the disaster so widely predicted hasn’t materialized. It’s worth delving into the state’s response — as described by DeSantis and a couple of members of his team — because it is the opposite of the media narrative of a Trump-friendly governor disregarding the facts to pursue a reckless agenda. DeSantis and his team have followed the science closely from the beginning, which is why they forged a nuanced approach, but one that focused like a laser on the most vulnerable population, those in nursing homes.In an interview with <span class=""drop"">A</span>

But if we keep believing those same unrealistic promises and unworkable happy-talk . . . is the problem with those leaders . . . or with us for believing in them?Pretending that there is no choice and no tradeoffs does not liberate us from choosing. Mostly, it ensures that we choose poorly and that the choosing is left to ignorant and irresponsible demagogues.We do not have very many adults in government, but if we did, those adults would understand — and make a point of dwelling on the fact — that every decision of any consequence in public policy involves tradeoffs.

I wish them the best of luck.As stay-at-home orders went into effect across the country, the websites of local Planned Parenthood affiliates began to Despite routinely classifying itself as a health-care provider, Planned Parenthood has failed to offer any actual health care during the pandemic and has in fact merely ramped up its provision of abortion. In Pennsylvania, for instance, the organization shuttered all its health centers but kept open all its clinics that perform abortions. The president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, the group’s Colorado affiliate, said that its abortion numbers “have been pretty extraordinary” during the pandemic and cited an increase in women traveling from out of state for an abortion.Meanwhile, there is little evidence that the pandemic has created any financial problem for Planned Parenthood or prevented its affiliates from conducting their abortion business as usual. In several states, “reproductive health care” was explicitly classified as an essential service, and Planned Parenthood clinics were permitted to remain open and fully functional. In states that classified abortion as nonessential, Planned Parenthood joined other abortion-advocacy groups in swiftly suing to block those rules — and in most states, they won.According to its most recent financial report, Planned Parenthood had total net assets close to $2 billion and total revenue of about $1.7 billion last fiscal year. More than one-third of that revenue came from government reimbursements and grants, well over half a billion dollars.My piece yesterday explains a little more about why Planned Parenthood in no way qualifies as a small business:“Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion business, tried to defraud taxpayers during the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression,” Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) said in a statement after the news broke. “The Paycheck Protection Program is supposed to be a lifeline for small businesses, not a slush fund for Big Abortion. The administration needs to reclaim that money and fire the bureaucrats who signed off on this scam.”But that didn’t stop Planned Parenthood from claiming those small-business loans anyway. According to new reporting, 37 Planned Parenthood affiliates applied for and received a total of $80 million in loans from the Paycheck Protection Program, which was established by the CARES Act to aid small businesses during the economic fallout related to the COVID-19 pandemic.In earlier iterations of the stimulus legislation, Republicans quashed Democratic efforts to extend funding to Planned Parenthood, inserting language into the bill that prohibits nonprofit groups organized as affiliates — a category that includes Planned Parenthood’s business model — from receiving forgivable small-business loans.Yesterday, I wrote National ReviewFollow Us",0,Planned Parenthood Improperly Claimed $80 Million in Coronavirus-Relief Loans

The drive to enable this agenda has a serious chance of succeeding because those who have the ability to stop it refuse to see it as a serious threat. This piece published by an internationally influential NGO should be a wakeup call that the movement is not on the fringe anymore.Nature rights is one of the potentially destructive and radical agendas advancing in the world today. It would subvert human exceptionalism and reduce human freedom, because if everything has rights, the very concept would become as worthless as the Reichsmark became in Weimar.If nature is granted the status of personhood and accorded enforceable rights, we can kiss rebuilding a thriving economy goodbye. Worse, the world’s destitute would be thwarted from escaping their misery, as they would be prevented from exploiting natural resources because the copper in the mountain or the swamp near the river has the “right” not to be mined or drained.It is interesting to note that granting legal capacity to the elements of nature would also imply the recognition of their material assets such as funds accumulated through compensation or through their commercial activities. These funds could be used, for example, to hire lawyers in the case of a polluted lake, or to employ beekeepers to supervise the sustainable exploitation of a bee colony. These same funds could also be invested in the restoration of a damaged sub-ecosystem or the expansion of an endangered forest, alongside existing NGOs. By recognizing ecosystems as key stakeholders and even essential economic actors, this model would give them a chance to survive.Granting legal capacity to the elements of nature may also imply conceding oceans, forests and ecosystems’ representatives a seat alongside the world’s other decision-makers. After all, isn’t it their world too (human beings account for 0.01% of the Earth’s biomass)?Nature rights would become a trial lawyer full-employment scheme, as threats of cases or actual litigation would produce a cornucopia of money for the radicals to take it to the free-market system:Of course, “the stream” — a If the stream were to be granted legal capacity, it could defend its interests and its rights.

Try to avoid touching the same spots or objects as other people; if you must touch those spots, wear gloves.

No charge.I urge you to As the health officials put it, succinctly, “We wanted people out, not in.”At the other end of the equation at the nursing homes, the state made it clear, according to Mayhew, “if you are unable to adhere to these infection-control standards, if you are unable to safely isolate and dedicate staff to an isolation wing or unit, you need to transfer that individual to a hospital.”“What we said constantly is let’s not have two cases become 20 or five become 50,” she continues. “If you don’t manage this individual as you return them back, you will have far more being transferred back to the hospital.” Early on, when tests had a slow turnaround, there was a lot of pressure to give way, but Mayhew was unmovable on the question.Mary Mayhew had daily calls with the hospitals, with people involved in discharge planning on the line. “Every day on these calls,” she says, “I would hear the same comments and questions around, we need to get these individuals returned back to the nursing home. We drew a hard line early on. I said repeatedly to the hospital, to the CEOs, to the discharge planners, to the chief medical officers, ‘I understand that for 20 years it’s been ingrained, especially through Medicare reimbursement policy, to get individuals in and out. That is not our focus today. I’m not going to send anyone back to a nursing home who has the slightest risk of being positive.’”To simplify, in places in the Northeast like New York, the idea was to supposedly save the hospitals by getting COVID-positive patients out of hospitals and into nursing homes; in Florida, the idea was to save the nursing homes by keeping COVID patients in the hospitals or getting them into hospitals. Now, it’s obvious who was right, but Florida officials had to fight the hospitals on this.

There are a number doctors with solid qualifications who see promise in hydroxychloroquine as a therapeutic answer to COVID-19. Whether they are right or wrong is yet to be seen. Or maybe not, since knee-jerk anti-Trumpism has created an environment where scientists can’t conduct a simple study.So Giles was unable to conduct any trials. Other doctors are struggling to find people as well. There is no other conceivable reason why this happens other than the politicization and fear-mongering of a drug.  Merely because Trump championed the drug, Dana Milbank feels free to compare it to “You might remember the same media that is deeply offended by Trump’s championing of an “unproven” drug wrote story after story about “We are hearing now from some participants that the study and the drug feel too political and they just don’t want to participate at all,” says Dr. Christine Johnston at the University of Washington. Giles also points out that hydroxychloroquine is a “very, very safe drug,” and yet he can’t get people to participate in a study because “pretty much everyone” believes it’s “dangerous to your heart.”Listen to this NPR Now, I get that Biden thinks it’s cute to merge the myth that Trump wants Americans to inject themselves with bleach and the president’s unproven prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine. It’s worth noting, however, that the presumptive Democratic Party nominee is also now telling Americans — including those who need this low-risk prescribed drug that has been approved for all public use for over 70 years — that taking hydroxychloroquine is tantamount to injecting yourself with bleach.Yesterday, I National ReviewFollow Us",0,Trump Hate Is Making It Harder to Study Hydroxychloroquine

He also asks that the SBA outline the steps it is taking to ensure that the Planned Parenthood affiliates in question return the funds they received, with interest.It is worth noting, too, that Planned Parenthood itself has openly acknowledged that its affiliates were ineligible for the PPP loans, complaining about that fact “In the light of the clear text of the CARES Act and Planned Parenthood’s own admission that every one of its offices are affiliated with each other, it is hard to conclude anything other than that Planned Parenthood committed fraud,” the letter went on. “The SBA application form required each of the 37 Planned Parenthood affiliates to certify that Planned Parenthood, as a whole, employs no more than 500 employees. The application form further required Planned Parenthood to certify that it ‘underst[oo]d that knowingly making a false statement to obtain a guaranteed loan from SBA is punishable under the law.’”“Section 1102 of [the CARES Act] says that nonprofits are eligible for the program only if they and their affiliate organizations have no more than 500 employees. As the White House correctly said last month, Planned Parenthood, at about 16,000 employees nationally, fails to meet this requirement,” Hawley wrote in his letter.Even so, the SBA disbursed a total of $80 million in those loans to 37 Planned Parenthood affiliates across the country.The CARES Act, which created the PPP to administer forgivable loans to small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdowns, explicitly stated that nonprofits organized as affiliates — Planned Parenthood’s business model — did not qualify as small businesses for the purposes of the loans.Senator Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) has sent a letter to the Small Business Administration, asking its officials to explain how Planned Parenthood affiliates were able to receive $80 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans despite being ineligible and accusing the abortion business of committing fraud.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Hawley Asks the SBA How Planned Parenthood Improperly Received Small-Business Loans

Normally, patients develop chest discomfort, pain with breathing and other breathing problems. But when Covid pneumonia first strikes, patients don’t feel short of breath, even as their oxygen levels fall. And by the time they do, they have alarmingly low oxygen levels and moderate-to-severe pneumonia (as seen on chest X-rays). Normal oxygen saturation for most persons at sea level is 94 to 100 percent; Covid pneumonia patients I saw had oxygen saturations as low as 50 percent.Pneumonia caused by the coronavirus has had a stunning impact on the city’s hospital system. . . . During my recent time at Bellevue, though, almost all the E.R. patients had Covid pneumonia.Pneumonia, or inflammation of the air sacs in the lungs in response to an infection, is one of the biggest ways the virus is killing people. A reader points out that the results of the trials in monkeys could still yield a treatment that would mitigate the effects of the virus, if not cure it: “On autopsy, the researchers found the virus in the vaccinated monkeys’ lungs. On the upside, none of the vaccinated monkeys displayed pneumonia which suggests that, while not stopping the virus, it may be partially protective.”In National ReviewFollow Us",0,Maybe a Vaccine Effort Could Create a Way to Prevent Pneumonia?

I’ll be honest: I thought, based upon what we were seeing, that spread in places such as the New York City subways was driven in large part by people touching the same objects — poles, handrails, buttons, turnstiles, etc. Apparently, that was a smaller factor, and the primary factor was just people coming within six feet of each other.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adjusted its coronavirus guidelines slightly Wednesday, emphasizing that the virus spreads <strong>Don’t Touch That! . . . but It Probably Won’t Kill You</strong>For the past two months, one of the most dangerous places in the world has been a nursing home in New York state.

Sometimes I miss the old familiar political news and discussion, too. But the pandemic and its aftershocks are (Connecticut has You can see how many people are itching to return to the familiar culture-war fights — I go back and forth on how much the focus of the news should shift away from the pandemic, and how quickly. In normal times, the <strong>Are News Institutions Getting Tired of Covering the Coronavirus?</strong>One other indicator of the divide between those who are minimally impacted by the pandemic restrictions and the rest: Have you noticed how a portion of the news environment is moving on from the pandemic, even though our daily lives have not?Open the city. All of it. Right now. Broadway shows, beaches, Yankees games, the schools, the top of the freakin’ Empire State building. Everything. New Yorkers have already learned to socially distance. Businesses can adjust. The elderly and infirm can continue to be isolated.Beloved haunts, storied rooms, perfect-slice joints are shuttered, many for good. The sweat equity of countless small-business owners is evaporating. Instead of getting people back to work providing for their families, our mayor talks about a fantasyland New Deal for the post-coronavirus era.Today in the Last week, the Apparently, quarantines are for the little people. If quarantines are optional for the wealthy and well-connected, we should not be surprised that they find them much more tolerable and worthy of extension than everyone else.I’ll give you a moment to cope with the shock that a Washington-based media executive, a movie producer, a Democratic political operative, a Washington city councilman, and a well-known lobbyist and their spouses believed the rules didn’t apply to them. At least the ambassador could hide behind diplomatic immunity. (Where’s Roger Murtaugh when you need him?)“People did not want to leave,” the media executive told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity, to avoid being Covid-shamed — a new shorthand term for people behaving with apparent indifference to the safety of others. “But everyone had been cooped up for so long, there was much to discuss.”At the second party, held over the weekend at the home of a Democrat political operative, one of the guests brought the food: “lamb to belatedly celebrate Easter.” In attendance were an ambassador, a city councilman and a well-known lobbyist. The night was balmy and they all sat outside for hours.At that dinner party, the food was prepared by a live-in chef, who was masked and gloved, and then served by the producer’s wife.The first dinner was hosted by a movie producer. A group of four listened to music and sat under heated lamps six feet apart in the garden where they were served dinner. According to the executive, none had been in contact with anyone who had suffered Covid-19 — as far as they knew. All had been isolating.Each time, he explained, the host’s instructions were the same. For both dinners, he entered through the back gate of the property, so disapproving neighbors would not see him. He was told in advance that neither he, nor any other guests, could take any photographs or talk about the party.When he first told me this, I assumed I had either misheard or misunderstood. “Virtual dinners right?” I asked. “No” was the reply. These were the old-fashioned, in-person sort.In contravention of the city’s shelter-in-place executive order, he secretly attended two different dinner parties in Georgetown, an affluent DC-neighborhood.Last week, a Washington, DC-based media executive who is used to attending 200 cocktail parties a year decided that he could take talking to his microwave no more.From the beginning, we’ve seen evidence that the wealthy and well-connected could more or less buy their way out of the inconveniences and hardship of quarantines. Everybody’s enduring hardship in one form or another. Well, almost everybody.We’ve still got giant problems to work out.

No charge.<span>NOW WATCH: </span><em>Editor’s note: This piece has been updated since its initial publication.</em>Read the full text of the letter The letter was signed by Cotton and McConnell, along with Senators Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.), John Boozman (Ark.), Mike Braun (Ind.), Bill Cassidy (La.), John Cornyn (Texas), Ted Cruz (Texas), Steve Daines (Mont.), Mike Enzi (Wy.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (Miss.), Jim Inhofe (Okla.), John Kennedy (La.), James Lankford (Okla.), Mike Lee (Utah), Kelly Loeffler (Ga.), David Perdue (Ga.), Jim Risch (Idaho), Mitt Romney (Utah), Mike Rounds (S.D.), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Rick Scott (Fla.), Tim Scott (S.C.), John Thune (S.D.), and Todd Young (Ind.).The letter concludes by stating that the PPP was designed to assist small businesses and nonprofits in meeting payroll and retaining their employees during the COVID-19 shutdowns. “It was not designed to give government funds to politicized, partisan abortion providers like Planned Parenthood,” the senators write. “Planned Parenthood fraudulently taking tens of millions of dollars that were intended to help keep those small businesses and nonprofit organizations afloat cannot stand and must be addressed.”“Based on these statements, it seems clear that Planned Parenthood knew that it was ineligible for the small business loans under the CARES Act long before its affiliates fraudulently self-certified that they were eligible,” the senators continue. “As you know, fraudulent loan applications can trigger both civil and criminal penalties.”In other words, the organization publicly acknowledged that it was excluded from the loan program, and complained about that fact, just before dozens of its affiliates self-certified as eligible for the loans and claimed them.Despite that, dozens of Planned Parenthood affiliates applied for these loans, and 37 received them. The letter demonstrates that Planned Parenthood executives themselves appeared aware that the program excluded them from applying for the loans: “Most damningly, Planned Parenthood’s own political action committee, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, issued a statement on the CARES Act after the Act’s passage in the Senate, saying: ‘The bill gives the Small Business Administration broad discretion to exclude Planned Parenthood affiliates and other non-profits serving people with low incomes and deny them benefits under the new small business loan program.’”“These Planned Parenthood entities self-certified eligibility for these loans despite the clear ineligibility under the statutory text of [CARES Act],” the senators write. “It was also well-publicized at the time that the CARES Act did not allow Planned Parenthood affiliates to utilize these loans.” They point out that Trump-administration officials publicly clarified that the affiliate restriction meant no funds from the PPP could go to Planned Parenthood.According to this letter, a copy of which was provided exclusively to Based on its most recent financial report, Planned Parenthood had total net assets close to $2 billion and total revenue of about $1.7 billion last fiscal year. The group operates hundreds of clinics across the country, organized into dozens of affiliates, and employs about 16,000 workers, far exceeding the 500-employee cap applied to the small-business loan program.Earlier this week, news broke that dozens of Planned Parenthood affiliates had applied for and received a total of about $80 million in forgivable loans from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), established by the CARES Act for small-business relief, despite the fact that Congress explicitly excluded nonprofit organizations set up as affiliates — large, nonprofit organizations such as Planned Parenthood — from applying for that funding.This morning, Republican senators — including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) — sent a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr, calling on the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood for improperly claiming coronavirus-relief loans designed for small businesses. The letter was spearheaded by Senator Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) and signed by more than two dozen GOP senators.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Exclusive: Republican Senators Call On DOJ to Investigate Planned Parenthood for Fraud

In 2016, Jones was also “I’ve asked the Department of Health to explain to me how someone would be allowed to be charged with that and continue on, because this was many months ago,” DeSantis stated. “I have a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment.”While speaking to reporters on Tuesday, DeSantis also said that Jones should not have been working for the government in the first place because she is facing active criminal charges.“If this is tried and true and it is scientifically relevant, then that data is released through a data-sharing agreement, and that’s how we make data available,” she explained. “There’s a lot of ongoing projects throughout the state, with universities, with researchers from other states, so it is a regular process at the department to make different data available to the public in a very transparent way. But there is a protocol.”It is unclear whether the data is accurate, as well as if Jones’s sharing of the data broke the law or violated her government contract. Roberson explained, however, that while data can be requested for public release, any “human subjects research” requires a review by a health department board, as well as a review of a data-use agreement by the appropriate data custodian, before public consumption.“I made some charts for the data that there’s simply no room on the dashboard for, so I’m presenting them here for your pleasure,” Jones explains, followed by her own personal analysis of the numbers.“If you haven’t checked out my fantabulous online dashboard, officially the state’s public face of Florida’s coronavirus response, you should do so,” the March 30 blog In addition to misrepresenting the contents of her email to the public listserv and inflating her role in the DOH, Jones also published state COVID-19 data on her personal blog without going through the proper channels established to ensure their reliability.DeSantis himself told reporters Tuesday that Jones was “not involved in collating any data,” and suggested the media was making a “Jones did not respond to a request for comment about her dismissal. She “She was forever clashing with her team, because she was not a team player. She was erratic. She changed information without consulting with the epidemiological team or her supervisor, and, in short, she was insubordinate,” she explained. “She perceived that she had ownership of this dashboard, which is completely inaccurate.”Ferré added that it was Jones’s “insubordination that led to her dismissal,” and that her notice of termination was delivered on Monday.“That is not an accurate assessment, that she built [the dashboard], she participated in putting the dashboard together, she played a role in the development of the website dashboard,” Ferré told Helen Aguirre Ferré, communications director for Florida governor Ron DeSantis, explained that Jones’s “function” was “to load the data into the graphics.”Other outlets, including But the dashboard was not built by Jones and is not even proprietary to the Florida Department of Health.

So data-quality review is always an ongoing process at the department, and senior epidemiologists, they can at their discretion, make that decision to review additional fields based on new information and other things.”But Florida deputy health secretary Dr. Shamarial Roberson, who orchestrated the state’s expanded COVID-19 tracing force, told Much of the mainstream political “This is the wrong call,” Jones replied in an email to the request, before complying.

Democrats are pushing to extend the $600 additional unemployment bonus through to January 2021, with a possible extension to March 2021. However, there is no good reason the UI extension, as written in the CARES Act, should be extended beyond July 31, especially given that COVID-19 conditions are improving.In addition, for some restaurant owners, furloughed workers are asking for significant increase in wages before they agree to come back. While it is always a good thing when employees have bargaining power, it is unfortunate when it is the product of government’s intervention, as in the case of the expansion of unemployment benefits under the CARES Act.Of course, this explains why it is so hard for restaurants to keep their workers and This is not a unique finding. Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that three-quarters of laid-off workers are in line to receive benefits that exceed their former wages. Also, economists have already This data comes with a few important caveats. One is that because government data lags, the sample of workers the researchers drew on for the analysis does not reflect the much larger pool of people who are unemployed right now. If anything, Ganong told me, that means the researchers’ estimates may understate how many unemployed workers will be eligible to receive more than their original salary during the current crisis, since the effects of the economic shutdown have  Over at National ReviewFollow Us",0,Employment Disincentives at Work

No charge.We might be comforted by the notion that we can take the hard lessons of the early days of this virus with us into the future and try to apply them to the next pandemic. But there’s a catch: The “luckier” we are — the longer we go without another deadly pandemic after this one passes — the likelier it is that members of the public will forget those lessons, and react with the same nonchalance and skepticism that initially greeted this pandemic.It is indisputable that most places enacted lockdowns far too slowly. But those who want to fight pandemics with strict quarantines will always be fighting the nature of both communicable diseases And Trump wasn’t alone. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio was arguably even worse, telling his constituents to go about their lives normally until March 11. 
With all of that said, our government, at every level, is expected to see these problems clearly even when the public cannot. We spend an enormous amount of money to get the best information possible to policymakers. President Trump’s management of this crisis has been pretty bad. His “Normalcy bias” — the idea that tomorrow will be like today, because today was like yesterday — is an extremely powerful force in human psychology. For most Americans, the idea of a strict national lockdown until further notice in response to a virus was the stuff of sci-fi movies. SARS, H1N1, MERS, Ebola, Zika — we were warned about all of those infectious-disease threats, but most of them barely affected our lives. There was always going to be skepticism that this was that bad, and that sweeping, draconian precautions were necessary.The public might have been more receptive to a dire warning by March 8; by then, the United States had 541 cases and 22 deaths, and the exponential growth was starting to show in the figures and charts. But if any date represented a turning point for the coronavirus in the U.S., it was March 11, when the World Health Organization officially declared a global pandemic, the NCAA announced plans to play its later-canceled basketball tournament without fans, the National Basketball Association suspended its season, and the president announced travel restrictions on visitors from Europe. And even with all of that shocking news, across the country, people still Would Americans have willingly complied? A lot of them probably would have, but a significant number of them would have thought the measures were a wild, paranoid overreaction.My fellow Americans, a new virus that first arose in China has now infected 68 people and killed one. We must immediately close all nonessential businesses and schools, postpone all non-life-threatening medical care, cancel every public event and gathering, and remain inside our homes, leaving only for brief periods of exercise and grocery shopping. We must stay six feet apart from everyone except our immediate families. These extraordinarily disruptive and strict measures will be maintained until further notice, even though they will almost certainly create a level of unemployment on par with the Great Depression. This is a terrible burden, but if we wait even another two weeks, we will bear witness to the deaths of 100,000 Americans by Memorial Day.While some school districts And if the country had begun locking down cities and limiting social contact on March 1, two weeks earlier than most people started staying home, the vast majority of the nation’s deaths — about 83 percent — would have been avoided, the researchers estimated.If the United States had begun imposing social distancing measures one week earlier than it did in March, about 36,000 fewer people would have died in the coronavirus outbreak, according to <span class=""drop"">T</span>

In this case, the truth is information that might make people think it’s safe to go outside again.Meanwhile, progressives and many journalists have developed a near-theological commitment to the lockdowns, such that any information that undermines them is considered unwelcome, even threatening. This accounts for the widespread sense that no one should say things have gotten better . . . The press has a natural affinity for catastrophes, which make compelling viewing and good copy. The pandemic is indeed a once-in-a-generation story. So the media is naturally loath to shift gears and acknowledge that the coronavirus  has begun to loosen its grip.The question now is whether the media and political system can absorb good news on the virus, which is often ignored or buried under misleading storylines.I have a National ReviewFollow Us",0,‘It’s OK to Acknowledge Good Covid-19 News’

They are brother and sister.</em>Elections are sacred. Americans have shed blood for the right to vote, and many would put their lives on the line for democracy again. But why should they do so needlessly? No party and no representative worthy of the name should demand that.Finally, American citizens must remind their politicians that a representative works for the people who voted him or her into office, not for the party, and not for the president. The American people want options for absentee and safe in-person voting in November. A poll in late April found that 70 percent of Seventh, states must prepare quickly. Sixth, states must take legal action to prevent hacking and voter fraud. Such steps are, again, both right as a matter of principle and necessary to overcome partisan wrangling. In the fight against voter fraud, signature-matching, ballot-tracking, and a commitment to prosecuting wrongdoers are proven tools. Affording voters the opportunity to prove questioned signatures is, of course, equally necessary. As to hacking, experience has shown that paper ballots are the most effective means of prevention. There is no system of e-voting that can’t be hacked, but paper ballots work, and absentee ballots are paper ballots.Fifth, Congress must provide funding. States can’t afford the necessary steps otherwise. And since this election is for national offices, the federal government should take some responsibility for it, as a matter of principle.Fourth, overcome Democratic partisanship based on political opportunism. Some Democrats want to seize on the crisis to make permanent changes to our voting system. Republican opposition would defeat that effort. Nothing would get done. Instead, both parties should agree that any alteration to the voting system in November should include sunset clauses stipulating that the changes are a one-off.In any case, these aren’t ordinary times. A recent Third, overcome Republican partisanship based on bad facts. Political observers often assume that absentee voting helps Democrats, but that assumption might be wrong even in ordinary times. 
Second, realize that this election is a matter of national pride and international power. American elections matter beyond U.S. borders. China and the United States are competing for influence in the world today. Prior phases of the competition were about economic productivity and military might. The present one is about which political system can deal more effectively with a pandemic. The world is watching, and the results could affect the future prospects of democracy itself.In the end, Democrats came out ahead, picking up a key state-supreme-court seat. That fact alone should spur Republicans to reconsider whether insisting on in-person voting is good for the party, at least during an election that has liberals fired up and the elderly inclined to stay home. But the larger story in Wisconsin was an election “almost certain to be First, recognize that we risk a Wisconsin-style election debacle if we The tough part is to get political leaders on board and to take the necessary action in time. To that end, American political leaders and citizens need to take eight steps.The principle is high-minded, but the methods of accomplishing it are practical. The key is to massively expand two existing and proven systems: absentee voting and a suite of safe methods by which to vote in person (e.g., drive-through voting and augmented hours at the polls to reduce standing in line).<span class=""drop"">T</span>

Those patterns may shift as the seasons turn over, but it seems likely from what we know so far that the pandemic will continue to have its greatest effect in the temperate and urbanized regions of the world.Sao Tome and Principe’s high death rate may be partly a statistical fluke due to its small size. Algeria’s presence near the top of the list is undoubtedly at least partly a factor of its continuing close ties with neighboring France.<img alt="""" class=""size-full wp-image-813451 aligncenter"" data-image-id=""813451"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" height=""1112"" loading=""lazy"" sizes=""(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-13.jpg?resize=598%2C1112&amp;ssl=1"" srcset=""https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-13.jpg?w=598&amp;ssl=1 598w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-13.jpg?resize=161%2C300&amp;ssl=1 161w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-13.jpg?resize=551%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 551w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-13.jpg?resize=319%2C593&amp;ssl=1 319w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-13.jpg?resize=247%2C460&amp;ssl=1 247w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-13.jpg?resize=310%2C576&amp;ssl=1 310w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-13.jpg?resize=27%2C50&amp;ssl=1 27w"" width=""598""/>Finally, Africa:The region has only a handful of countries — but almost 1.8 billion people — yet fewer than 5,000 reported COVID-19 deaths.

Undoubtedly, many of the poorest countries are also underreporting, not on purpose, but because people there are likelier to die at home, and the health-care system is less able to devote resources to classifying deaths. The presence of Thailand and Taiwan, however, is interesting. Thailand was one of the world’s first countries to have COVID-19 cases, due to direct travel from Wuhan. But it also has a tropical climate, with high humidity and temperatures in the 90s in February.<img alt="""" class=""size-full wp-image-813441 aligncenter"" data-image-id=""813441"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" height=""797"" loading=""lazy"" sizes=""(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-5.jpg?resize=598%2C797&amp;ssl=1"" srcset=""https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-5.jpg?w=598&amp;ssl=1 598w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-5.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-5.jpg?resize=445%2C593&amp;ssl=1 445w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-5.jpg?resize=345%2C460&amp;ssl=1 345w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-5.jpg?resize=432%2C576&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-5.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-5.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-5.jpg?resize=38%2C50&amp;ssl=1 38w"" width=""598""/>Now, the countries with the fewest reported deaths per capita:The American states below the world average include the southern border (Texas’s death rate is comparable to that of neighboring Mexico), the West Coast (Oregon) and some states in the interior that are (with the exception of Utah) comparatively less connected to global travel and migration.<img alt="""" class=""size-full wp-image-813440 aligncenter"" data-image-id=""813440"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" height=""755"" loading=""lazy"" sizes=""(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-4.jpg?resize=598%2C755&amp;ssl=1"" srcset=""https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-4.jpg?w=598&amp;ssl=1 598w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-4.jpg?resize=238%2C300&amp;ssl=1 238w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-4.jpg?resize=459%2C580&amp;ssl=1 459w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-4.jpg?resize=364%2C460&amp;ssl=1 364w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-4.jpg?resize=456%2C576&amp;ssl=1 456w, https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-4.jpg?resize=40%2C50&amp;ssl=1 40w"" width=""598""/>Here’s the third list, including the last few jurisdictions above the global average:American states are still grouped around European countries, with even Germany — one of the European countries that has done relatively well — above Florida, Arizona, California, and Wisconsin.

There’s a natural temptation to focus narrowly on the red/blue divide, given that the top of the list of states is heavily dominated by deep-blue states, their governments long run at many levels by Democrats. It’s fair enough to assess with hindsight what kinds of governments and reactions led to worse results, but even aside from   
   New York also stands out on its own, well ahead of the rest of the world, with its neighbors New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts all above any nation of more than 100,000 people. In fact, outside of tiny San Marino, New York’s per capita death rate is nearly double that of any nation on earth. The national U.S. death rate drops from 280 per million to 167 per million outside of the Tri-State area. That’s still a high rate on a global basis, a bit higher than Canada’s, but it’s also lower than the regional average for Europe. The Northeast is really in its own category from the rest of the country, and is an enormous driver of the overall national numbers.As you can see from the above, the top of the global list is dominated by European countries and American states. The United States, with the largest raw number of reported deaths in the world, drops to eleventh when ranked on a per capita basis, behind ten European countries. Two of the top three are tiny microstates, but Italy, Spain, France, and Britain have all been hit worse than the United States. So has Sweden, with its much-vaunted experiment in developing herd immunity by keeping the country open. Ecuador is the lone representative of the Southern Hemisphere on the worst list.<img alt="""" class=""size-full wp-image-813438 aligncenter"" data-image-id=""813438"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" height=""797"" loading=""lazy"" sizes=""(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px"" src=""https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-2.jpg?resize=598%2C797&amp;ssl=1"" srcset=""https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-2.jpg?w=598&amp;ssl=1 598w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-2.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-2.jpg?resize=445%2C593&amp;ssl=1 445w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-2.jpg?resize=345%2C460&amp;ssl=1 345w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-2.jpg?resize=432%2C576&amp;ssl=1 432w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-2.jpg?resize=414%2C552&amp;ssl=1 414w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-2.jpg?resize=354%2C472&amp;ssl=1 354w, https://i1.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/COVID-per-Capita-2.jpg?resize=38%2C50&amp;ssl=1 38w"" width=""598""/>Here’s the 33 jurisdictions (nations or U.S. states) with the highest per-capita death rates:<strong>The Worst</strong>It is, in any event, hard to explain the scale of variation between East Asia and Europe or South America solely on the basis of different government policies.

It is the ultimate bottom line: How many of your people have you lost? It is still not a perfect measurement: It relies on accurate reporting (something not all governments can be trusted to do), it still has a time lag, and there remain varying standards in how different locales decide which deaths are “COVID-related.” But unlike infection rates, the numbers are not as sensitive to the availability of testing. And death rates are not only more available than hospitalization rates, they also measure the ultimate success or failure of hospitalization.<span class=""drop"">S</span>

No charge.<em>© 2020 by King Features Syndicate</em>It’s not as though we haven’t had a cataract of unassailably legitimate bad news over the past few months. We’ve been experiencing a wrenching public-health crisis and a steep recession on top of it. There shouldn’t be a need to obscure favorable trends. We can handle the truth.Headlines noted that Florida recorded 500 new cases in one day. It generated fewer headlines, and perhaps none, when Governor Ron DeSantis explained that the state had received a dump of 75,000 test results, yielding the 500 new cases, for a minuscule positivity rate of 0.64%.A North Carolina TV station tweeted, “Breaking News: NC sees largest spike in coronavirus cases since pandemic began.” That referred to 800 new cases over the past 24 hours on May 16. But tests had been going sharply up and the positivity rate trending down.The key indicator is the positivity rate, and it was down in Texas.The press has often, out of sloppiness or willfulness, tried to create negative news around the reopenings. CNN tweeted last weekend, “Texas is seeing the highest number of new coronavirus cases and deaths just two weeks after it officially re-opened.” As Sean Trende of The reopenings could certainly still go awry, but so far there is no clear indication of it. Cases are still falling in Austria, Denmark, and Norway, despite those countries’ being relatively far along on reopening. Denmark has been mystified why it is almost five weeks into reopening and hasn’t yet seen increases in infections.Scott Gottlieb of the American Enterprise Institute notes that the positivity rate, or percentage of people testing positive, has continued to fall throughout May.Testing capacity, such a concern for so long, has really begun to expand after hitting a plateau for weeks. Testing nationally on some days has been in the high 300,000s or over 400,000. The issue in some states now is not capacity, but actually finding enough people to test.As data analyst Nate Silver pointed out the other day, the seven-day rolling average for deaths is 1,362, down from 1,761 the previous week and a peak of 2,070 on April 21. That’s still much too high, but the trend is favorable.Almost all of the discussion about reopening is framed by worries that we will reopen too soon, not that we might reopen too late. That is literally unthinkable, even as we have entered a new phase.Usually, when it is thought the public can’t handle the truth, it is a truth about some threat that could spark panic. In this case, the truth is information that might make people think it’s safe to go outside again.
Meanwhile, progressives and many journalists have developed a near-theological commitment to the lockdowns, such that any information that undermines them is considered unwelcome, even threatening. This accounts for the widespread sense that no one should say things have gotten better . . . The press has a natural affinity for catastrophes, which make compelling viewing and good copy. The pandemic is indeed a once-in-a-generation story. So, the media are naturally loath to shift gears and acknowledge that the coronavirus has begun to loosen its grip.The question now is whether the media and political system can absorb good news on the virus, which is often ignored or buried under misleading storylines.The coronavirus has taken a heartbreaking toll on Americans, but the course of the virus is not the same as it was a few months ago. We are on the other side of the curve. There are encouraging signs all over the country, and no early indications of a reopening debacle.<span class=""drop"">I</span>

Churches are vital to the spiritual health of this country and worthy of protecting from lawsuits.”The bill establishes that the liability protection it provides would supersede state laws that are inconsistent with its provisions, unless they provide greater protection from liability. Hartzler says she already has the support of a few cosponsors and is hopeful there will be bipartisan backing for the proposal.Hartzler’s legislation also provides that nonprofits will not be free of liability if the “harm was caused by an act or omission constituting willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a conscious flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed.”The bill, known as the “Service Assurance Act,” provides that “a nonprofit organization shall not be liable under Federal or State law for any act or omission of the organization with respect to any harm arising from exposure to, or infection by, the virus that causes COVID–19 during a public health emergency with respect to COVID–19.”“I think it’s very important for our churches and nonprofit organizations to have assurance as they reopen that they will be able to continue to provide services to the needy with confidence,” Hartzler said of her legislation in an interview with Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler (R., Mo.), who represents Missouri’s fourth congressional district, has introduced a piece of legislation to extend liability protections to nonprofits as states begin to lift their stay-at-home and shutdown orders across the country.National ReviewFollow Us",0,Exclusive: Rep.

And, given the organization’s own open opposition to the CARES Act, there is no argument to be made that the group was unaware of its affiliates’ ineligibility for the program.Republicans won that fight, as illustrated by the bill text, reporting at the time, and subsequent clarifying statements from Trump-administration officials. Section 1102 of the CARES Act states that nonprofits are eligible for PPP loans only if they and their affiliates have no more than 500 employees. Planned Parenthood has about 16,000 employees, a whopping 32 times as many as the maximum-employee cap outlined in the bill.In fact, there is no gray area on this question: The text of the CARES Act makes it exceptionally clear that nonprofit organizations such as Planned Parenthood are not eligible for loans under the PPP, and that fact was highly publicized at the time of the bill’s passage. The part of the bill outlining eligibility for the loans was a particular point of contention during congressional debate precisely because the final wording would determine whether the abortion provider would be able to claim federal funding.Planned Parenthood would have us believe both that Congress should be condemned for excluding the group from funding This is false for several reasons, not least of which is that Planned Parenthood itself has already openly admitted its lack of eligibility for the loans.

President Trump, who has not always taken a consistent stance against international despotism, has rightly warned that the U.S. will react “very strongly” if China moves ahead with the law. Just as China has turned the pressure up on Hong Kong, so it has done with many of its trade partners. China is showing us that its economic leverage will be used against the political freedom of its “friends.” It’s time to learn that lesson.Over the last 20 years, Hong Kongers have demonstrated that they have the reserves of courage and fortitude found among freeborn men living in republics of their own. But even if China should get its way and impose itself on Hong Kong through these “security measures,” for at least another generation or more, that desire for freedom can be kept alive, waiting for its opportunity to strike.So Hong Kongers can only protect their autonomy the way all small nations do against behemoth powers at the doorstep: by being ungovernable save on their own terms. This requires an immense amount of unity and morale among the people themselves, and even then the outcome is not certain.What’s being done to Hong Kongers is an immense injustice. But Hong Kong cannot depend on outside intervention for assistance. Beyond some diplomatic pressure from the United States, little else is coming. No major power has the ability or will to protect Hong Kong’s autonomy with military threats.<span>NOW WATCH: </span>Past attempts at “security legislation” or other measures aimed at Hong Kong’s independence were met with furious protests. Hong Kong’s democracy movement has taken to the streets in 2003, in the 2014 Umbrella movement, and in the massive civil unrest of 2019. The advanced guard of Hong Kong activists are hardened, committed, and, in many cases, radicalized. But they may face a problem of protest fatigue and resignation among supporters.Abrogating the two-systems settlement is an injustice, and a foreseeable one. Hong Kong now represents less than 3 percent of China’s economy. And so Beijing senses it can strike a new bargain, renege on its treaty obligation, and put to death any notion that Hong Kong’s style of government will ever win out by persuasion.At the time of the treaty, little Hong Kong accounted for nearly 20 percent of China’s overall economy, and it was a crucial engine of China’s economic growth. Companies that wanted to do business in a liberalizing China headquartered in Hong Kong. Financial markets still prefer it. Why? Because it has inherited a property-rights regime and a judicial system from the Anglo tradition. One could make a case in a Hong Kong court and expect a fair hearing, rather than a political judgment dictated by a party boss.China’s move against Hong Kong is likely dictated by propitious circumstances. Democracy protesters in Hong Kong may be fatigued. And while the rest of the world deals with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is little appetite to expend the diplomatic energy or engage in the trade actions that could protect Hong Kong.China’s legislature in Beijing is preparing a new national-security law aimed at Hong Kong to prohibit and punish terrorism, foreign influence, and secession. By that, they mean demonstration, free speech, and a functioning democratic system with rights guaranteed to citizens. Meanwhile, Beijing’s loyalists installed in Hong Kong’s legislative council have been making open attempts at a putsch against the pro-democracy majority.<span class=""small_caps""><span class=""drop"">C</span>hina</span>

He is survived by his dad, With Oakland under new leadership in 1980 — Billy Martin began his post-Yankees term at the helm of Athletics — an inspired Keough went 16–13, with a 2.92 ERA and 20 complete games. It was a legitimate comeback, and the Sporting News award was clearly deserved. Keough would hurl through 1986, pitching for the Yankees, Cardinals, Cubs, and Astros. His career record was 58–84 with a 4.17 ERA.But further depths were waiting. In 1979, Keough had one of the worst-ever seasons of any MLB pitcher (since, in fact, the 1916 Athletics duo of That was the height. Then came the plunge: For the remainder of 1978, Keough went 2–11, with a season ERA of 3.24.It would be harder to get to deeper depths than had Oakland Athletics righthander Back in the day, before the practice was hijacked by the MLB, the august<strong>Baseballery</strong><em>All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, essential and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberty; that of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness.</em>The Declaration of Independence, drafted by Thomas Jefferson, states that all men are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, and among them are “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” As the political historian Matthew Spalding wrote, the founders understood that life, liberty, and property were closely connected, as expressed in the 1780 Massachusetts Bill of Rights:In 1776, two documents were published that shaped America and the rest of the world. In In the Millennials urgently need some remedial history to fill the gaps left in their education. Many young Americans sympathetic to socialism mistakenly believe that capitalism is a relatively modern concept, first seriously examined in Karl Marx’s BONUS A complete contingent set of moral rules isn’t feasible either. Too many things can happen for anyone to prescribe what to do in each of the countless possible future worlds. That’s what Christ taught, in His answer to the rich young man in the Synoptic Gospels. The young man said he had followed all the commandments and wondered if anything more was required of him. Indeed yes, said Christ. If you want to be perfect, sell all you own and give to the poor, then come and follow Me. No wonder the disciples were dismayed. Who then can be saved, they wondered? (The answer is no one, absent grace.)Lawyers understand the limits of rules from their efforts at drafting long-term contracts. The goal in such cases is to assign rights and responsibilities for everything that might happen thereafter, and the problem is that this is impossible. A perfectly specified contract would tell the parties what to do in every conceivable future state of the world, completely covering every possible contingency. But there are just too many things that might happen. A “complete contingent contract” can never be written, and the best one can hope for is that, when the unexpected happens, we’ll find a good judge who’ll interpret the contract the way the parties would have written it had they addressed their minds to the possibility.Finally, my problem with natural law is a problem with law itself. That’s not to say that laws don’t matter. They’re the first cut at a moral answer, and in many cases that’s all you need. “Thou shalt not kill” doesn’t admit of too many exceptions. But rules are not enough. We might think that we’ve followed all the rules, but still wonder whether something more is wanted of us. The moral life is more than the rule-driven life.6. At Rubinstein’s memo is a response to a The letter does not explicitly state which schools lobbied the department to keep their records confidential.Nevertheless, he added, staff will contact each school under investigation and let them know which records will be provided to Congress. To block a document being handed over, an objecting school “must provide written specification of the records designated for withholding and specific supporting legal grounds,” the letter states.Rubinstein wrote that some schools may be overly aggressive in marking some documents “confidential” or “privileged.”The letter, written by the Education Department’s General Counsel Reed Rubinstein, tells lawmakers who requested the documents that the universities’ lawyers “claimed Freedom of Information Act exemptions and legal privileges to block record production to Congress.”Attorneys for universities under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education are trying to block Congress from obtaining records that detail the schools’ ties with China, according to a May 19 letter exclusively obtained by 5. At There’s a pernicious canard circulating that focusing on the economy is “putting money before lives.” Does anyone seriously believe that these apocalyptic numbers do not spell extreme pain and decreased life expectancy for the vast majority of Americans?In contrast, a targeted approach would not have required such a costly economic shutdown, quite simply because it would have focused almost exclusively upon people of retirement age.The economic fallout of the shutdown has been catastrophic: more than What leaps to mind is that, in trying to protect everyone, we left the highly vulnerable few tragically exposed. A central precept of medicine in the context of scarce resources is triage. God knows, we had scarce resources as the pandemic broke out. When everyone can’t be saved, triage means focusing policy, effort and resources in a manner designed to maximize survivors — in the case of this virus, to protect those most clearly vulnerable.4. How the vulnerable were hung out to dry, and die. At In the overwhelming rush of post-war nationalism, however, President Madison in 1816 wanted a Second Bank of the United States. From its opening moments, the Second Bank of the United States (SUSB) was a disaster for the country, economically and politically. Even Madison’s appointment of William Jones as the first president of the SUSB was pathetic, as Jones had been Madison’s Secretary of the Navy and a failed businessman. The appointment had been a mere political favor, and Jones had absolutely no clue how to run a bank. Worse, Jones was corrupt, and he used his position as president of the Bank to increase the wealth and prestige of his friends. The Bank quickly became an efficient means to shift wealth from the political nobodies to the politically-endowed. Hoping to avoid too much criticism—especially for the obvious political corruption—the Bank offered easy loans on easy credit, and, as a consequence, initiated one of the greatest eras of debt (proportionately) in the U.S. In 1815, for example, a year prior to the Bank’s creation, there was only $3 million in debt on the purchase of public lands. Two years after the creation of the SUSB, public debt on public lands stood at $17 million, and it reached $22 million a year later, in 1819. The number of banks—fueled by easy credit—expanded rapidly as well. In 1816, the year the SUSB came into existence, there were 246 banks in the U.S. Three years later, in 1819, there were 400. A committee of the Pennsylvania legislature reported: “The plenty of money, as it was called, was so profuse, that the managers of banks were fearful that they could not find a demand for all they could fabricate, and it was no infrequent occurrence to hear solicitations urged to individuals to become borrowers, under promises of indulgences the most tempting.”When the First Bank expired in 1811, interestingly enough, no one seriously considered re-chartering it.The First Bank, however, influenced much more than mere economics, and many scholars believe that divisions caused by the Bank—whether the constitution should be interpreted broadly or strictly—led to the creation of the first real political divisions in the country.When President Washington approved the chartering of the Bank for twenty years, it immediately (again, for better or worse) created debt on which private banks could borrow and it also put the United States—at least on paper—on par with other great powers in the world who also relied upon debt and financial manipulation. Of the twenty-five governors, only five would come from the U.S. government, with the rest coming from private industry. The United States enjoyed immense prosperity during the years of the First Bank, but its prosperity—fueled by trade with warring Britain and France—might very well have been in spite of the Bank rather than because of the Bank.3. At There was a philosopher once who placed fear and death at the heart of the social order. His name, of course, was Thomas Hobbes. The commentators and activists who police our attitudes toward fear and death today are not his disciples, but they are his children. Their liberalism—including in the case of many who identify as conservatives but identify their conservatism as “classical liberalism”—is conditioned and made possible by his philosophy, rebellious though they may be against the harsh truths of their father. Though liberalism explicitly prizes any number of lovely ideals, from freedom and equality to dignity and self-determination, at root it is an ideology of negation: “freedom from,” whether freedom from political control, from religious authority, or from fear itself. And the sort of character that would disregard death, and is moved by feelings stronger than fear, has to be negated before liberalism becomes possible. Hobbes tried to achieve that negation through a revolutionary philosophical framework, and liberalism today thrives only in his system’s shadow.The professional opinion media played its role in all of this. An illustrative example was the reception that met R. R. Reno’s essay “Say ‘No’ to Death’s Dominion,” published on March 20 in A clash over policies and the trade-offs involved would be one thing, and, given the stakes, such a clash would inevitably involve powerful emotions. But even where there were minimal policy differences, those who were deemed by social media activists to be insufficiently affrighted were subjected to vitriolic hostility—standing accused of callousness or rank stupidity, a deficiency in morals or intelligence or both. Being a good person came to mean not just staying indoors and washing your hands and doing everything necessary to minimize your chances of catching the virus or infecting others, but also following self-appointed opinion leaders up to the right pitch of anxiety. Nothing practical depended on doing so, but something of the highest importance for social psychology did.Fear was a natural enough response to the arrival of the coronavirus on America’s shores. The novel virus from Wuhan is highly infectious and had already caused thousands of deaths in China and Italy by the time hotspots of infection began to appear here. What was remarkable, however, was not that Americans were alarmed to the point of panic-hoarding toilet paper, or that officials responded with such sweeping policies as “shelter in place” orders, but that activists on social media reacted with fury toward anyone who failed to be fearful enough—anyone who, for example, questioned the wisdom of shutting down the consumer economy virtually overnight, with predictably dire consequences for the millions of cooks, waiters, drivers, bartenders, retail clerks, hotel workers, and others who do not enjoy the luxury of being able to work from home.2. In the new issue of This is certainly the view of the Trump administration, which has responded to the WHO’s total failure to hold Beijing to account for causing the global pandemic by threatening to withdraw its support from the organisation altogether.The only problem for Mr Xi and his communist comrades is that the WHO, through its slavish devotion to Beijing, now finds itself hopelessly compromised by its close association with China’s leadership, with the result that no one beyond the confines of Beijing believes the organisation has the Mr Xi’s offer, therefore, to support an inquiry by the WHO into the pandemic amounts to little more than yet another attempt by China’s communist rulers to avoid proper scrutiny about Beijing’s culpability for spreading Covid-19 throughout the rest of the globe.A total of 122 countries, including the U.S. and most European governments, have given their backing to an Australian proposal to set up an impartial, independent and comprehensive investigation into the handling of the Covid-19 outbreak. But the move has been bitterly opposed by Beijing, which claims the initiative is nothing more than a “political manoeuvre”. The Chinese are particularly China’s deliberate attempts to obfuscate the origins of the pandemic has provoked an outcry, with a number of nations, such as the U.S. and 1.

Pretending to console students for missing out on what Obama listed as “proms, senior nights, graduation ceremonies, and, let’s face it, a whole bunch of parties,” Both the film and the telecast are products of media indoctrination, the none-too-subtle political programming that eludes notice — and alarm — by posing as cultural remedies. <em>Booksmart,</em>1.

Prior redactions had already demonstrated that the meeting’s central purpose was to discuss the rationale for withholding intelligence about Russia from the incoming Trump national-security team.Naturally, we have now learned that Rice was deeply involved in the Obama administration’s Trump–Russia investigation, including its sub-investigation of Flynn, a top Trump campaign surrogate who was slated to replace Rice as national-security advisor when President Trump took office.

Second, realize that this election is a matter of national pride and international power. American elections matter beyond U.S. borders.

The world is watching, and the results could affect the future prospects of democracy itself.In the end, Democrats came out ahead, picking up a key state-supreme-court seat.

Robert Mueller on 198 occasions told House members while under oath that he could not answer their questions because he didn’t know, he couldn’t remember, he couldn’t speculate, or he couldn’t get into such matters. He seemed oblivious to the role that the Steele dossier and Fusion GPS had played in the entire collusion mythography — as Congress was left to speculate whether Mueller was either lying or James Comey on 245 occasions could not remember or did not know the answer when asked factual questions by the House Intelligence Committee. Did the FBI stickler for memorializing presidential conversations and taking notes nonstop simply have an unplugged moment like Power, or is he suffering some of the same cognitive issues that now challenge Joe Biden?Samantha Power testified to Congress that she could not remember her own requests to the NSA for the identities of more than 300 redacted American names swept up in government surveillance. In response, Congressman Trey Gowdy described her as “the largest unmasker of U.S. persons in our history” — a curious obsession with espionage and intelligence for a U.N. ambassador. Did Power have sudden memory loss while testifying under oath, or was her office a de facto clearinghouse for dozens of lower-level operatives who sought her pro forma signature to allow them to request unmaskings of such redactions? Or was the Harvard-trained lawyer simply lying under oath? Did she assume that no one of her stature who lies to Congress — compare the exemptions given congressional prevaricators such as James Clapper and John Brennan — is ever held to account? Apparently not in Power’s mind, when in March 2018 she warned Donald Trump about the reach even then of former CIA director John Brennan: “Not a good idea to piss off John Brennan.”11. When it comes to the corruption and criminality behind the Obama administration’s contrived case against General Flynn, and so much related to that, Victor Davis Hanson is naming names and creating categories. <em>What she wore</em>The date range and corroboration are more specific than anything Blasey Ford offered. In that case, we had nothing to go on but a range of years in the early 1980s. Nonetheless, it still puts Biden in a position similar to that of Kavanaugh: He can’t really be expected to provide an alibi without a more specific time period.<em>When</em>The Capitol and Senate building complexes are full of twists and turns and alcove-like places that can be secluded, even during business hours. Senators have Reade’s account would be more credible if she could place the alleged assault in an identifiable location. This was a point of contention in Christine Blasey Ford’s story: She never identified an address or whose house the alleged assault occurred in, or how she got home. This is not necessarily decisive, however, so much as it is a reminder that memories in general are untrustworthy at a distance of a quarter century or more.10. Dan McLaughlin does a thorough deep-dive into the known facts about Tara Read. As for our brief toilet-paper drought — Venezuela’s has been going on for a The government sets the price of gasoline at almost $0.00 (on paper, about a penny for 26 gallons) and rigorously controls production and distribution of the stuff — and so, of course, it is virtually impossible for an ordinary Venezuelan to legally purchase gasoline. Instead, Venezuelans buy gasoline, if they can buy it at all, on the black market, where they pay some of the highest prices in the world, well over $10 a gallon in a country in which most people earn less than $10 a month. In local terms, the average monthly salary in Venezuela will not pay for a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of beef. In the United States, a month’s work at the Gasoline is very cheap in Venezuela. You could buy all you wanted — if you could buy any at all.It was, for a minute there, hard to find toilet paper in some places. Because the epidemic has been especially punishing for workers in meat-processing facilities, there have been some local shortages of meat, accompanied by such Captain Obvious headlines as: “Meat shortage prompts price hike.” A price hike is exactly what you want in a shortage. Before you start whining about “price gouging” (“price gouging” is what happens when the ordinary operation of free markets reflects real-world conditions that politicians wish were other than what they are) consider the alternative: the so-called paradox of gasoline in Venezuela.Every way of organizing community life (and that’s what “the economy” is — one important part of community life) brings with it certain advantages, certain disadvantages, and certain risks, and the disruptions caused by the coronavirus epidemic have exposed some of the weaknesses in our way of doing things. Those weaknesses are, as far as the current evidence will show, pretty modest. The low-inventory “just in time” model of production and distribution that characterizes so much of American business saves businesses and their customers money by reducing such carrying costs as warehousing, but it also means that retailers and distributors typically do not have a great deal of product on hand to see them through an interruption in deliveries.We may not yet have a vaccine against the novel coronavirus, but we are well on our way to extracting from that virus a vaccine against a far deadlier plague: socialism, which in the 20th century alone killed more than three times as many people as HIV did in the same time, which has killed about twice as many people as the Black Death killed in the 14th century, and which continues to afflict victims around the world from Cuba to North Korea to Venezuela.9. Kevin Williamson believes that the coronavirus lockdown may have infected the cause of socialism. More worrisome is China’s alleged involvement in Australia’s political system. Late last year, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) — the domestic counter-terror, counter-intelligence agency — acknowledged an investigation into allegations from 2018 by a Melbourne car dealer that a businessman with links to Norinco, a Chinese state-owned defense company, offered him $1 million or more to run for Parliament from the suburban Melbourne community of Chisholm. The car dealer, according to press reports, was heavily in debt and was later found dead in a Melbourne hotel room. The man who made the alleged offer denied it, and the circumstances as well as the details of the investigation remain cloudy. But the pattern is one that Western intelligence agencies, including ASIO, take seriously. Certainly, Beijing attempted to undermine the recent presidential election in Taiwan and remains active in influence operations against the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. A Chinese defector to Australia late last year created a stir with his detailed descriptions of PRC activities in Taiwan and Hong; he had participated in operations in both places.This influx has created a microcosm of broader tensions within the region in the Xi era on Australian university campuses. Last year during the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Australian universities were venues for both Hong Kong–sympathetic demonstrations and counter-protests by pro-Beijing students. Violence requiring police action occurred at several locations, reflecting, as the China’s bullying and threats toward Australia go deeper than the trading relationship. Just behind beef, barley, and other commodities that Australia exports to China is education. PRC nationals as a percentage of all foreign nationals in Australian universities have doubled to more than 30 percent in the past 20 years. In the Australian Capital Territory of Canberra and surrounding communities, six in ten foreign students are from the PRC.8. Australia is taking on Red China. Therese Shaheen says it is critical that the U.S. stand lockstep with its Down Under ally. Bassett claims that Ronald Reagan did not genuinely oppose abortion, since he signed a liberalization law as governor of California. “Then as president, he said he regretted that move and suddenly opposed all abortions except to save the life of the mother.” Her chronology is wrong — Reagan had switched positions in public by at least Bassett tries to suggest that the pro-life movement originated because white Evangelical Christians were upset about racial desegregation. But her own story undermines the indictment. Desegregation upset Jerry Falwell Sr., she writes. But then she quotes someone else noting that white Evangelicals could not be mobilized based on that issue, and she says that Paul Weyrich tried a number of other issues to get them involved. Abortion worked. In other words, a lot more Evangelicals were fired up to fight abortion than were fired up to defend segregation. That’s supposed to reflect badly on them?7.

She declared herself “baffled” that the nuns considered this requirement a violation of their conscience and that all nine justices of the Supreme Court had taken their complaint seriously. Maybe if she had read on to the second page of the “one-page form,” she would have solved the mystery: Page two proclaimed the form to be the “instrument” that triggered the requirement that a third-party administrator provide the coverage.

The state and the city continued to work at cross purposes behind closed doors. “The state Health Department broke off routine sharing of information and strategy with its city counterpart in February,” In New York, the public is today the victim of Cuomo’s longstanding, bizarre, petty, counterproductive hostility toward his fellow Democrat de Blasio. Though de Blasio publicly stated on March 17 that a shelter-in-place order might be necessary, and said so gingerly so as not to poke the bear, Cuomo fired back that it wasn’t necessary and that only he had the authority to give such an order. Privately he derided de Blasio as offering a scenario more befitting a nuclear apocalypse, according to 3. Kyle Smith runs down the laundry list of Andrew Cuomo’s deadly choices. So how did DeSantis go about responding to the epidemic? It began with the data, and trying to learn the lessons of other countries.Perhaps more understandably, The Villages, the iconic senior community, was a focus of media worries. According to DeSantis, as of last weekend there hadn’t been a single resident of The Villages in the hospital for COVID-19 for about a week. At one point, the infection rate in The Villages was so low that state officials were worried that they were missing something. “So I got the University of Florida to do a study,” he says. “They did 1,200 asymptomatic seniors at The Villages, and not one of them came back positive, which was really incredible.”DeSantis is bemused by the obsession with Florida’s beaches. When they opened in Jacksonville, it was a big national story, usually relayed with a dire tone. “Jacksonville has almost no COVID activity outside of a nursing-home context,” he says. “Their hospitalizations are down, ICU down since the beaches opened a month ago. And yet, nobody talks about it. It’s just like, ‘Okay, we just move on to the next target.’”The media didn’t exactly have their eyes on the ball. “The day that the media had their first big freak-out about Florida was March 15th,” DeSantis recalls, “which was, there were people on Clearwater Beach, and it was this big deal. That same day is when we signed the executive order to, one, ban visitation in the nursing homes, and two, ban the reintroduction of a COVID-positive patient back into a nursing home.”An irony of the national coverage of the coronavirus crisis is that at the same time DeSantis was being made into a villain, New York governor Andrew Cuomo was being elevated as a hero, even though the DeSantis approach to nursing homes was obviously superior to that of Cuomo. Florida went out of its way to get COVID-19-positive people out of nursing homes, while New York went out of its way to get them in, a policy now widely acknowledged to have been a debacle.2. More Rich: He wants to know where media-mugged Florida governor Ron DeSantis goes to get back his reputation. The story of what they’ve done is a key part of the administration’s response, even if it has been obscured by a press that has an allergy to anything that has worked.A team around White House adviser Jared Kushner and the supply-chain task force under Admiral Polowczyk worked to fly supplies from overseas to the U.S. quickly, to vet leads for additional PPE (the work of volunteers from the business world mustered by Kushner’s team), and to build a cooperative relationship with 3M, the country’s most important manufacturer of N95 respirators.None of this happened by accident. At a time of unprecedented stress on the supply chain and a yawning gap between supply and demand in the market, it required considerable clever improvisation and determined hustle. This was not your average bureaucratic response. It was a partnership between the public and private sector to get supplies to the United States on an urgent basis and ship them to the places that needed them most, and then begin to ramp up manufacturing here at home.According to Admiral John Polowczyk, head of the supply-chain task force at FEMA, we manufactured roughly 30 million N95 respirators domestically a month before the COVID-19 crisis. He says we are on a path now to ramp up to 180 million N95 respirators a month.This is manifestly false. In a briefing for reporters last week on FEMA’s work securing PPE, FEMA administrator Peter Gaynor laid out the raw numbers: FEMA, HHS, and the private sector have shipped or are currently shipping 92.7 million N95 respirators, 133 million surgical masks, 10.5 million face shields, 42.4 million surgical gowns, and 989 million gloves.Any government response to a once-in-a-generation crisis is going to be subject to legitimate criticism, and there’s no question that almost every major government in the Western world, including ours, should have acted sooner.

Hong Kong now represents less than 3 percent of China’s economy. And so Beijing senses it can strike a new bargain, renege on its treaty obligation, and put to death any notion that Hong Kong’s style of government will ever win out by persuasion.At the time of the treaty, little Hong Kong accounted for nearly 20 percent of China’s overall economy, and it was a crucial engine of China’s economic growth. Companies that wanted to do business in a liberalizing China headquartered in Hong Kong. Financial markets still prefer it. Why? Because it has inherited a property-rights regime and a judicial system from the Anglo tradition. One could make a case in a Hong Kong court and expect a fair hearing, rather than a political judgment dictated by a party boss.China’s move against Hong Kong is likely dictated by propitious circumstances. Democracy protesters in Hong Kong may be fatigued. And while the rest of the world deals with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is little appetite to expend the diplomatic energy or engage in the trade actions that could protect Hong Kong.3.

It will embroil the White House and the Republican Party in defending hydroxychloroquine for the same reason his critics loathe a drug they hadn’t heard of before a few months ago — simply because it is a thing Trump favors. The vice president has already felt it necessary to state that he is not taking it.The responsible thing to do with a clinically untested treatment is go where the evidence follows. The president, however, has responded to the barrage of criticism with his trademark relish for a fight. He now has publicly declared that he is taking hydroxychloroquine himself, as if his personal confidence in the drug is all that matters.Hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, is a well-established medicine for other purposes, and its potential has been worth exploring. Some promising early results led Democratic governors such as Andrew Cuomo and Gretchen Whitmer to join the White House task force’s cautious optimism. Too many of the president’s critics instead dug themselves into actively rooting for the treatment to fail.2. That America is fixated on hydrowhatevertheheck is idiotic.

No charge.Liberals in California’s one-party state are on an ideological crusade to continue a racial spoils system forever. They should realize how much of the country disagrees with them and how the politics of the issue could once again surprise them and blow up in their face.When Justice Sandra Day O’Connor provided the critical vote upholding the constitutionality of the University of Michigan’s racial preferences in 2003, she wrote that the Court expected that affirmative action would need to continue for only another quarter-century.Many universities — fueled by white guilt – have long ignored the Civil Rights Act’s prohibitions on race discrimination. But we now know there are hidden nonwhite victims of that guilt, whether they be minorities who often drop out if mismatched with the wrong university or Asian Americans denied admission on the merits.  
     
   It’s true that some minority students shifted from the most elite UC campuses to other campuses. But as Gail Heriot, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, noted in a piece for California doesn’t need a new flare-up of racial division. Proposition 209 is working. As Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor Jr. show in their 2012 book, “Those numbers are why bringing this issue forward now would inevitably divide Californians racially: Latino Americans and African Americans on one side, Asian Americans on the other,” former California congressman Tom Campbell, now an independent, wrote in the While Asian Americans are a seventh of Californians, they represent 40 percent of University of California students.Should liberals in California ignore the experience of their Washington State counterparts and push for the return of racial quotas, they will be stepping into a hornet’s nest.“We’ve seen a lot more suspicion of liberal motives among Asians in Washington state since last year’s attempt to kill color-blind policies here,” John Carlson, a Seattle talk-show host and the original sponsor of Washington state’s color-blind college admission policy, told me. “People also know the liberals can now be beaten.”But they can swing back, as the special-election victory by Republican Mike Garcia for a vacant House seat in Los Angeles proved this month. Garcia won a ten-point victory, including a majority of independents.Unusually high numbers of Asian Americans are neither Republicans nor Democrats. In California, about 40 percent are independents — the classic swing voter. In 2018, their swing to the Democrats was behind the party’s narrow capture of several ancestrally Republican House seats in Orange and Los Angeles Counties.In California, 14 percent of eligible voters are now Asian Americans (nationwide the number is 5 percent). By 2050, Asian Americans will account for a tenth of the nation’s voters and at least a fifth of California voters, according to Taeku Lee, a UC Berkeley scholar and a co-author of the National Asian American Survey.All of this is likely to be exposed during any debate over ACA-5 — the California bill to repeal Prop 209. Asian-Americans will take the lead in opposing ACA-5, but a nationwide Pew Research poll last year found that majorities of all racial and ethnic groups say The alternative — racial discrimination — is a sordid business. A lawsuit filed by Asian Americans against Harvard University has revealed just how arbitrary and subjective its admissions process really is. Asian-American voters are well aware their children face a rigged system at universities that don’t have Proposition 209 protections. Preferential treatment for some groups necessarily means discrimination against others.
That’s also what California Democrats themselves concluded back in 2014.They should remember what happened when this was attempted before. Last year, liberals in Washington State used a similar route to repeal that state’s version of Proposition 209, which had passed with 58 percent in 1998. Liberals vastly outspent opponents and won endorsements from leading establishment figures. But they still lost, as voters rejected preferential treatment 51 to 49 percent. Retrying that strategy in a highly visible California referendum would be dicey.Next month, Golden State Democrats plan to use the two-thirds control they have in the legislature to push through a November ballot measure asking voters to end the ban on racial preferences.Caucasian Americans are now only 19 percent of UC students, down from 38 percent a quarter century ago — this change reflects the increasing ethnic diversity of Californians .Two things often happen when a single political party dominates a state the way Democrats dominate California. First, an echo chamber of the dominant party convinces its leaders they can steamroll over any opposition. Second, that conviction leads to political overreach.<span class=""drop"">R</span>

In a situation as complicated as the one we face, there is no easy, simple, scientific answer offering leaders a roadmap out of crisis. To say otherwise undermines the effort to protect public health and prevent more harm than we’ve already seen.However, were we to take that course, we would risk failing to provide the next generation of leaders the education they need and to do the research and scholarship so valuable to our society. How ought these competing risks be weighed? No science, simply as science, can answer that question. It is a moral question in which principles to which we are committed are in tension.If we gave the first principle absolute priority, our decision about reopening would be easy. We would keep everyone away until an effective vaccine was universally available.Our decision to return to on-campus classes for the fall semester was guided by three principles that arise from our core university goals. First, we strive to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff and their loved ones. Second, we endeavor to offer an education of the whole person — body, mind and spirit — and we believe that residential life and personal interactions with faculty members and among students are critical to such an education. Finally, we seek to advance human understanding through research, scholarship and creative expression.Here’s more of what Fr. Jenkins writes:Fr. Jenkins rightly acknowledges that there is more to the equation than consulting the information made available through science. Medical professionals and scientists are invaluable and can tell us much about how a disease behaves, and they can project a number of situations that might come about depending on how we act, but they can’t offer us a foolproof, one-size-fits-all plan for how a vast country can mitigate the risks and balance the potential harms of responding to a global pandemic.This point often seems to be left out in our debates over how best to respond to the coronavirus outbreak, how soon certain states or regions ought to reopen, and what reopening should look like at different times and in different parts of the country. Some pundits seem to believe that, in crafting their policies, institutions and local officials ought to consider only the views of a certain taskforce or certain set of officials, accepting their preferred policy because the science is settled, so to speak. In this view, the “experts” have the ability to craft a policy response that will serve us all best and necessarily be the best way to solve the complex situation we face.He opens by praising the work of Dr. Anthony Fauci but writes that “there are, however, questions that a scientist, speaking strictly as a scientist, cannot answer for us. For questions about moral value — how we ought to decide and act — science can inform our deliberations, but it cannot provide the answer.”In today’s Notre Dame was one of the first major universities to propose a plan for how it aims to reopen in the fall. Other universities, such as Princeton, have said they’ll wait another month to announce a plan. This contrast has earned Notre Dame some derision, for instance in the The proposed plan will bring students back to campus in August two weeks earlier than usual, cancel the week-long fall break in mid October, and conclude the semester before Thanksgiving. The university has said it plans to conduct orientations for new campus policies due to COVID-19; institute testing protocols, contact tracing, and quarantining as needed; and promote preventive measures, such as hand-washing, social distancing, and some mask wearing.A few weeks back, the University of Notre Dame outlined its plan for reopening campus in the fall, detailing the way in which the administration hopes to bring students back to South Bend to resume in-person classes. Like the overwhelming majority of colleges and universities in the U.S., Notre Dame shifted all of this past semester’s classes to online learning immediately after the school’s mid-March break.National ReviewFollow Us",0,"Science, Coronavirus, and Notre Dame"
